Learned changes in interlimb coordination can be induced by exposure to a split-belt treadmill that imposes different speeds under each side of the body. Here, we demonstrate locomotor learning on a split-belt treadmill in mice. Mouse locomotor adaptation is specific to measures of interlimb coordination, has spatial and temporal components that adapt at different rates, and is context specific. The many similarities between human and mouse locomotor adaptation suggest that this form of locomotor learning is highly conserved across vertebrates. Using a variety of approaches, we demonstrate that split-belt adaptation in mice specifically depends on the intermediate cerebellum but is insensitive to large lesions of the cerebral cortex. Finally, cell-type-specific chemogenetics combined with quantitative behavioral analysis reveals that spatial and temporal components of locomotor adaptation are dissociable on the circuit level. Vertebrate control of locomotion involves multiple brain areas that work together to control its initiation, execution, and coordination (, , ). For instance, basic patterns of rhythmic locomotion can be generated by the spinal cord alone (, , , ), while brainstem and midbrain structures control starting and stopping, and modulate speed (, , , , ). Meanwhile, the cerebellum is critical for coordinating movements across the body. Uncoordinated walking, or gait ataxia, is a hallmark of cerebellar damage and is characterized by pronounced deficits in multi-joint and interlimb coordination (, , , , ) In general, the cerebellum is thought to keep movements calibrated through a form of motor learning known as motor adaptation, an error-driven learning process through which motor responses to predictable perturbations are gradually compensated (, , ). Locomotor adaptation has been demonstrated in both humans and cats using a split-belt treadmill that imposes unequal speeds on the two sides of the body (, , ). Locomotor adaptation is cerebellum dependent (, ), and previous studies have shown that humans learn to adapt locomotor patterns and regain gait symmetry through specific changes in interlimb coordination (, ). Human locomotor adaptation has both spatial and temporal components (i.e., there are learned changes in both the location and timing of foot placement) (). Many lines of behavioral evidence suggest that spatial and temporal adaptation are dissociable (, , , , ). Space and time are adapted at different rates, have different developmental onsets, and are differentially influenced by explicit strategies and distraction (, , ). Despite abundant evidence for the dissociability of spatial and temporal locomotor learning, little is known about how this is achieved on a circuit level. Insights into specific circuit mechanisms for cerebellum-dependent learning have mainly come from investigations of relatively simple behaviors like eye movements and classical eyeblink conditioning (, , , , , , , , , ), due in large part to the difficulties associated with measuring whole-body movements like locomotion in animal models (, , , ). Here, we developed a transparent split-belt treadmill for mice\u00a0that provides high-resolution, quantitative readouts of locomotor coordination () in order to study the neural circuit mechanisms underlying locomotor adaptation. Like human learning, mouse locomotor adaptation is specific to measures of interlimb coordination, has spatial and temporal components that adapt at different rates, and is context-specific. Further, split-belt adaptation in mice depends on an intact cerebellum but is independent of cerebral cortex. Using a cell-type-specific chemogenetic strategy, we identified a specific subregion of the cerebellum that is required for split-belt treadmill adaptation and reveal distinct circuit mechanisms for spatial and temporal components of locomotor learning. We used a custom-built, fully transparent split-belt treadmill to assess locomotor learning in mice. The setup was a modified version of the LocoMouse setup we described previously (). Animals were placed in an acrylic corridor, and two independent motors controlled the speed of transparent treadmill belts underneath each side of the body (Figure\u00a01A). An angled mirror below the corridor allowed both side and bottom views to be captured using a single high-speed camera. Body features (paws, nose, and tail) were tracked using the LocoMouse tracking algorithm (Figure\u00a01B; ). For tracking validation and data inclusion criteria, see Figure\u00a0S1. Free-moving adult wild-type mice underwent adaptation protocols consisting of baseline, split-belt (adaptation), and washout phases. Sessions typically consisted of between 10 and 23 1-min trials run in rapid succession with brief rest periods between trials. Belt speeds were equal (tied) in baseline trials, were abruptly split (ca. 2:1 speed ratio) for the adaptation phase, and were returned to the original, symmetrical tied-belt speed in the washout phase (Figure\u00a01C). Mice were habituated to the setup and treadmill walking prior to split-belt adaptation and ran naturally and without reinforcement during the experiment (Video S1). Previous studies have demonstrated that learning in human split-belt locomotor adaptation is specific to measures of interlimb coordination (). While individual limb parameters reset abruptly upon changes in belt speeds, interlimb measures exhibit gradual changes to regain symmetry during the split-belt period and show subsequent after-effects that gradually disappear or \u201cwash out\u201d during the washout phase. First, we measured stride length, or the forward motion of an individual limb from lift-off (swing) to touchdown (stance) (Figures 1D, S2A, and S2B). Stride length scales with walking speed and as expected, mice rapidly altered their stride lengths according to the imposed speeds under each limb, with slow and fast front limbs taking shorter and longer strides, respectively (Figure\u00a01E; baseline v early split: t(20)\u00a0= \u221218.8, p\u00a0< 0.001). Despite large asymmetries, mice did not adapt stride length symmetry (fast limb stride length minus slow limb stride length) over the split-belt trials, and they did not show significant aftereffects in the washout period (Figures 1F and 1G; early versus late split: t(20)\u00a0= \u22121.13, p\u00a0= 0.78; early washout versus baseline:, t(20)\u00a0= \u22121.11, p\u00a0= 0.79). Next, we looked for evidence of learning by measuring the interlimb parameter step length, or the relative position difference between one limb and its contralateral homolog at the time of its own stance onset (Figures 1H and S2C). Front-limb step lengths were symmetrical at baseline but became asymmetric at the start of the split-belt phase, with slow limbs taking larger step lengths than fast limbs (Figure\u00a01I). Step-length asymmetry (fast limb step length minus slow limb step length) adapted over split-belt trials, with mice recovering an average of 57.9% of their initial error over 8\u00a0min (Figures 1I and 1J; early v late split:, t(25)\u00a0= \u22124.29, p\u00a0= 0.002). Prominent aftereffects were observed when belts were returned to equal speeds in washout trials (Figures 1J and 1K; early washout versus baseline: t(25)\u00a0= \u22124.02, p\u00a0= 0.004). Similar patterns of individual and interlimb changes were observed regardless of which side of the body experienced the faster belt speed, suggesting no effect of handedness (Figures S3A and S3B; left fast versus right fast, stride length scaling: t (9)\u00a0= 1.74, p\u00a0= 0.12; step length change over adaptation phase: t\u00a0(9)\u00a0= 0.087, p\u00a0= 0.93, step length aftereffect: t (9)\u00a0= 0.035, p\u00a0= 0.97). Split-belt walking also affected nose and tail movements. During normal forward locomotion, mice keep their nose and tail centered nearly perfectly (). In the split-belt phase, there was a tendency toward more leftward nose and tail positions (toward slow belt), with a small tendency to more rightward positions during early washout that did not reach statistical significance (Figures S3C and S3D; nose: F(4,16)\u00a0= 1.31, p\u00a0= 0.3; middle tail segment, ANOVA, exp. phase: F(4,16)\u00a0= 25.49, p\u00a0< 0.0001; baseline versus early split: t(16)\u00a0= 4.41, p\u00a0= 0.003; early versus late split: t(16)\u00a0= \u22120.196, p\u00a0= 0.99; early washout versus baseline: t(16)\u00a0= \u22122.04, p\u00a0= 0.29). To fully characterize mouse split-belt adaptation, we used a longer protocol to elicit more complete adaptation (Figure\u00a0S4A). In order to avoid fatigue, we divided this longer adaptation into\u00a0multiple sessions. After individual sessions consisting of 7\u201310\u00a0min of split-belt walking with no washout phase, mice were returned to their home cages, and the adaptation protocol was continued the next day. After 30\u00a0min of total adaptation time over five days, there was near complete (83.9%) front limb step length adaptation (Figures 2D and S4A; early versus late split: t(64)\u00a0= \u22126.59, p\u00a0< 0.0001; early washout versus baseline: t(64)\u00a0= \u22128.38, p\u00a0< 0.0001). This multi-session protocol allowed us to investigate overnight retention of learning. Analysis of session-to-session changes in step-length symmetry revealed high retention. In fact, step length showed transient improvements in symmetry at the beginning of subsequent sessions (Figure\u00a0S4A; mixed ANOVA, trial position: F(1,79.11)\u00a0= 11.75, p\u00a0= 0.0009). This could reflect consolidation of learning; however, these transient improvements were accompanied by changes in many gait parameters, including individual limb measures, and could simply reflect initial adjustments to treadmill walking. Next, we addressed the context specificity of mouse locomotor learning (see STAR Methods; Figure\u00a0S4B). Instead of undergoing washout, immediately following the adaptation phase of a split-belt experiment, animals were transferred to a non-motorized locomotor corridor (LocoMouse; ) to\u00a0look for transfer of aftereffects between treadmill and overground walking. Mice showed prominent step length aftereffects\u00a0on the treadmill (Figure\u00a0S4C; TM baseline versus TM adapted: t(4)\u00a0= \u22123.39, p\u00a0= 0.03), but these did not transfer to overground\u00a0walking (Figure\u00a0S4C; OG baseline versus OG adapted, t(4)\u00a0= \u22120.44, p\u00a0= 0.66). Thus, split-belt locomotor learning in mice, as in humans, does not generalize well across sensorimotor contexts (). Many forms of sensorimotor learning show evidence of savings, or faster relearning upon repeated exposures to an experimental perturbation (, , ), including human split-belt locomotor adaptation (). To test for savings in mouse locomotor adaptation, mice underwent a second round of split-belt treadmill adaptation following multisession adaptation and subsequent washout. We found no difference between adaptation and re-adaptation across any phase of the experiment (Figure\u00a0S4D, ANOVA, main effect, Adaptrep, F(2, 40)\u00a0= 0.005, p\u00a0= 0.94; interaction, exp. phase \u00d7 Adaptrep, F(2, 40)\u00a0= 0.13, p\u00a0= 0.87), suggesting no evidence for savings in this task in mice. Step length is a global measure of spatiotemporal interlimb relationships (, ). In early split-belt trials, asymmetries in both space and time contribute to overall step-length asymmetry (Figures 2A and S2C). Spatial asymmetry arises because the fast limb oscillates further back on the body than the slow limb (red and blue dashed horizontal lines, Figure\u00a02A). Temporal asymmetries are also present in early split-belt walking: fast limbs swing earlier relative to slow limbs. This temporal asymmetry results in asymmetric patterns of double support (phases of the stride cycle in which the two contralateral homologous limbs are both in stance; red and blue vertical shaded patches, Figures 2A and S2C). Since individual limb parameters (e.g., stride length) don\u2019t show learning, the initial step-length asymmetry (Figure\u00a02A vertical arrows) can be equalized either by incrementally adjusting the physical axis of limb oscillation (spatial adaptation, Figure\u00a02B) or by adjusting the relative timing of the movements of the two limbs (temporal adaptation, Figure\u00a02C). Step-length adaptation has been shown to have both spatial and temporal components in humans (). We quantified spatial adaptation using the center of oscillation of the limbs (coo, defined as the midpoint of swing and stance positions relative to the body; Figure\u00a02B, dashed horizontal lines; see STAR Methods and Figure\u00a0S2C). Temporal adaptation was quantified as changes in double support symmetry (ds; Figures 2A and 2C, shaded boxes; see also Figure\u00a0S2C). Mice adapted both spatial and temporal measures during the split-belt phase (Figures 2E and 2F; early versus late split, spatial: t(64)\u00a0= \u22126.18, p\u00a0< 0.0001; temporal: t(64)\u00a0= \u22124.62, p\u00a0< 0.0002), and showed clear aftereffects upon return to tied-belt walking (Figures 2E and 2F; early washout versus baseline, spatial: t(64)\u00a0= \u22127.55, p\u00a0< 0.0001; temporal, t(64)\u00a0= \u22124.05, p\u00a0< 0.001). To estimate the time course of spatial and temporal learning, average adaptation and washout curves were analyzed with shorter (6 s) bins and fit with exponential decay functions (Figures 2D\u2013F). As in human locomotor adaptation (), exponential fits showed differential adaptation rates for spatial and temporal adaptation during the split-belt period, with temporal adaptation occurring faster than spatial adaptation (temporal \u03bb\u00a0= 494.4 strides; spatial \u03bb\u00a0= 590.0 strides). Due to rapid initial washout, this period was better fit with double exponential equations, consistent with findings of faster washout than acquisition in human split-belt walking (, ). To better understand spatial and temporal contributions to step-length adaptation, we created a model to generate predictions of step-length adaptation across a full range of spatial and temporal shifts (Figure\u00a02G). Simulated strides were defined by fixed triangle waveforms set to average stride parameter values for fast and slow limbs in the early split period (see STAR Methods). To test the basic assumption that linear summation of changes in spatial and temporal interlimb symmetry fully account for the observed step length adaptation, we shifted the waveform for one front limb relative to the other in space and/or time and calculated predicted step-length symmetry for each shift. This generated a full predictive mapping of step-length error space during early split-belt walking (rainbow in Figure\u00a02G). The simulated spatiotemporal shifts accurately predicted step-length adaptation curves (r2\u00a0= 0.83; Figure\u00a02H). The small residual likely arises from subtle changes to individual limb parameters. The space of spatiotemporal combinations (Figure\u00a02G) shows many ways to reach step-length symmetry (Figure\u00a02G, green). On average, we found that animals used partial adaptation of both spatial and temporal components (Figure\u00a02G, black dots). The output of our model suggests that temporal shifts have a smaller impact on step length than spatial changes (Figure\u00a02H), in agreement with the results of a previously described analytical model that parses the spatial and temporal contributions (in mm) to step-length symmetry (). Finally, while individual animals don\u2019t categorize into spatial or temporal learners, across animals there was an inverse relationship between the magnitude of spatial and temporal contributions to overall step-length adaptation (Figure\u00a02I; Pearson correlation, r(16)\u00a0= \u22120.63, p\u00a0= 0.0069). Previous work in humans and decerebrate cats has implicated the cerebellum in split-belt treadmill adaptation (, ). We took a number of approaches to investigate the role of the cerebellum in mouse locomotor adaptation. First, we tested locomotor adaptation in two well-characterized ataxic mouse lines with abnormal cerebella, reelers and Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd) (). Reeler mice have many brain abnormalities and exhibit severe ataxia that has been attributed to cerebellar maldevelopment, including cerebellar hypoplasia and lack of cerebellar folds (Figure\u00a03A). Pcd is a recessive mutant mouse with moderate ataxia resulting from complete postnatal loss of Purkinje cells and subsequent partial loss of cerebellar granule cells (Figure\u00a03E). We ran mutants and their littermate controls in a split-belt protocol using lower overall speeds than those used in previous experiments but maintaining a similar belt ratio. Despite their ataxia, both reeler and pcd mice responded normally to the abrupt change in belt speeds at the onset of split-belt trials (Figures 3C and 3G; early split stride length, reeler versus littermates: t(8\u00a0= \u22120.82, p\u00a0= 0.45; pcd versus littermates: t(10)\u00a0= 0.30, p\u00a0= 0.77). However, both mutants were impaired at locomotor adaptation compared to their littermate controls (Figures 3B and 3F; step length early versus late split: reeler versus littermates: t(8)\u00a0= \u22122.87, p\u00a0= 0.02; pcd versus littermates: t(10)\u00a0= \u22124.18, p\u00a0= 0.002). Notably, pcd mice did not adapt even over three full sessions of split-belt walking (Figure\u00a03F; after-effect, pcd versus 0 mean distribution: t(3)\u00a0= 0.14, p\u00a0= 0.89). In both reeler and pcd, both spatial and temporal adaptation were eliminated (Figures 3D and 3H; aftereffects compared to littermates, reeler: coo, t(8)\u00a0= \u22122.36, p\u00a0= 0.04; double support, t(8)\u00a0= 5.67, p\u00a0< 0.001; pcd: coo, t(10)\u00a0= \u22122.62, p\u00a0= 0.02; double support, t(10)\u00a0= 4.28, p\u00a0= 0.002). Next, we investigated a possible role for the cerebral cortex, which has been implicated in other forms of motor adaptation (, , ). Mice underwent split-belt treadmill adaptation before and after bilateral aspiration of forelimb primary motor and somatosensory cortices (Figure\u00a03I). Lesioned animals, like the cerebellar mutants, were able to walk normally in the tied-belt condition and adjust their stride lengths with the change in belt speeds (Figure\u00a03K; stride length, early split, t(5)\u00a0= 0.17, p\u00a0= 0.86). Despite smaller initial split-belt asymmetries in these animals, normal aftereffects indicated that locomotor adaptation itself was unaffected by the lesion (Figure\u00a03J; step length, early split, t(5)\u00a0= \u22122.75, p\u00a0= 0.04; aftereffects: t(5)\u00a0= \u22121.17, p\u00a0= 0.29). Both spatial and temporal components of learning were intact (Figure\u00a03L). Localizing locomotor adaptation to a particular region of cerebellar cortex is complicated by its highly convoluted surface and fractured somatotopy (). In contrast, all output from the cerebellar cortex goes through Purkinje cells that project to one of a set of deep cerebellar (and/or vestibular) nuclei. Within the context of locomotion, each of the cerebellar nuclei has the potential to impact spinal locomotor circuitry, through direct or indirect projections (, ). To begin to narrow down the potential sites of cerebellar plasticity for split-belt locomotor adaptation, we targeted each deep cerebellar nucleus (medial, interposed, and lateral) using a chemogenetic approach (, ). We chose this approach because the timescale of DREADD action is well aligned with our task, in which learning evolves over minutes, with no particular trial structure or corresponding discrete events (). Further, this method, in contrast to more acute manipulations like optogenetics, did not itself cause movement or impair baseline walking (), which could confound motor learning (Video S2). We injected retrograde adeno-associated virus () unilaterally into the cerebellar nuclei of L7-cre mice for the cre-dependent expression of the Gi-coupled (inhibitory) DREADD, hM4Di, in Purkinje cells terminating there (Figure\u00a04A). In each case, DREADD expression was observed in the targeted nucleus and corresponding parasagittal regions of overlying Purkinje cells (Figures 4B and S4A). Some labeling was also seen in a subset of DCN neurons that project to the contralateral inferior olive independent of which nucleus was targeted. We observed no expression or axonal labeling in pre-cerebellar pontine nuclei or any downstream premotor sites. The pattern of Purkinje cell labeling for each injection was generally well-restricted mediolaterally, with some partial overlap due to spillover around the injection site, while anteroposterior spread was broader (Figures 4B and S5A). Two weeks after virus injection, mice were tested in split-belt adaptation experiments. We compared the adaptation exhibited by individual DREADD-expressing mice after administering saline or clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) intraperitoneally (Figures 4C\u2013H). Mice underwent adaptation protocols in which the fast belt was ipsilateral to the virus injection (ipsi-fast). Importantly, neither systemic CNO nor repeat adaptations interfered with adaptation; non-DREADD expressing animals adapted similarly with saline and upon subsequent administration of CNO (Figures S4D, S6A, and S6B; step length aftereffect, saline versus CNO; t(7)\u00a0= \u22120.87, p\u00a0= 0.41). In mice with medial nucleus injections, we observed no difference in step-length adaptation between saline and CNO conditions (step-length aftereffect, t(6)\u00a0= 0.53, p\u00a0= 0.55; Figures 4C and 4F). We also found no differences between saline and CNO conditions when targeting the lateral nucleus (Figures 4E and 4H, step-length aftereffect, t(5)\u00a0= \u22120.24, p\u00a0= 0.82). In contrast, for interposed injected animals, administration of CNO-impaired step-length adaptation (Figures 4D and 4G; step length aftereffect, CNO versus saline: t(9)\u00a0= 3.24, p\u00a0= 0.01). Importantly, DREADD-mediated inhibition in these animals did not cause overt ataxia. Unlike even mildly ataxic pcd mice, interposed-CNO animals were able to keep up with the normal, faster belt speeds, and we found no differences between saline and CNO conditions in baseline (tied belt) step-length asymmetry (t(9)\u00a0= \u22120.86, p\u00a0= 0.41) or in stride length scaling in early split (t(9)\u00a0= \u22120.93, p\u00a0= 0.38), indicating little perturbation of baseline locomotion. In a separate experiment, we tested the effects of unilateral DREADD-mediated inhibition with the fast belt contralateral to the injection site (contra-fast). As with the ipsi-fast condition, step length adaptation was only impaired following administration of CNO in interposed-injected mice (Figures S5B\u2013G; step-length aftereffect, CNO versus saline: medial: t(4)\u00a0= \u22120.65, p\u00a0= 0.62; interposed: t(6)\u00a0= 3.05, p\u00a0= 0.02; lateral: t(2)\u00a0= 0.68, p\u00a0= 0.56). These cell-type-specific chemogenetic experiments suggest a specific role for paravermal Purkinje cells in split-belt adaptation. As an independent test of this hypothesis, and since the retrograde virus also showed some expression in nucleo-olivary projection neurons, we injected pan-neuronal DREADDs directly in the paravermal cerebellar cortex. Similar to retrograde targeting (Figures 4B and S5A), this approach labeled cells around the primary fissure with little mediolateral spread (Figure\u00a0S6C). Anteroposterior spread, again, was broader, spanning several lobules. Direct manipulation of this region of cerebellar cortex was sufficient to impair step-length adaptation (Figures S6D and S6E; step-length aftereffect, CNO versus saline, t(3)\u00a0= 3.64, p\u00a0= 0.04). Step-length measurements compare the movements of two limbs relative to each other, but obscure information about how each limb contributes to adaptation. Next, we analyzed changes in spatial and temporal parameters for each of the four limbs individually in order to understand their contributions to overall locomotor adaptation and constrain possible mechanisms of learning. In contrast to the clear step-length adaptation observed in front limbs, evidence for learned changes in hindlimb step length was weaker. Over the long experiment, hind limbs only partially recovered symmetry (26.7%) over the split-belt period (Figure\u00a05A; early versus late split,: t(64)\u00a0= 3.67, p\u00a0= 0.004). In addition, hindlimb adaptation proceeded more slowly than front limb adaptation (coo \u03bb\u00a0= 1,804 strides). Breaking hindlimb adaptation down into spatial and temporal components revealed learning in spatial, but not temporal, parameters (Figures 5B and 5C; early versus late split, spatial: t(64)\u00a0= 3.86, p\u00a0= 0.002; temporal: t(6)\u00a0= 0.26, p\u00a0= 0.99). Next, we compared the contributions of each of the four individual limbs to spatial adaptation. In early split, both limbs on the fast belt oscillate further back on the body than the limbs on the slow belt (Figure\u00a05D). All four limbs showed spatial adaptation across the split-belt period: fast limbs shifted forward and slow limbs backward on the body with a magnitude that was similar across all paws (Figure\u00a05D\u2013F; compared to a 0 mean distribution, change over split trials: FR: t(144)\u00a0= 2.63\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.08; HR: t(144)\u00a0= 2.73, p\u00a0= 0.06; FL: t(144)\u00a0= \u22123.06, p\u00a0= 0.02; HL: t(144)\u00a0= \u22122.90, p\u00a0= 0.04; aftereffects: FR: t (144)\u00a0= 5.22, p\u00a0< 0.001; HR: t(144)\u00a0= 0.18, p\u00a0= 1; FL: t (144)\u00a0= \u22121.97, p\u00a0= 0.37; HL: t(144)\u00a0= \u22122.85, p\u00a0= 0.04). We examined temporal adaptation for individual limbs by measuring stance phasing, which gives the time of stance onset for each paw relative to that of a reference paw (in this case, the hind left). Mice normally trot across speeds, with diagonal limbs touching down together and out of phase with the opposite diagonal pair (; Figure\u00a05G, baseline). In early split, the normal pattern of interlimb coordination is disrupted; relative to the slow hind reference paw, all three of the other paws touch down earlier (Figure\u00a05G). Over the split-belt period, only the front right paw adjusted its timing relative to the reference paw, resulting in a recovery of their diagonal coupling (Figures 5G\u2013I; change over split trials, FR, t(99.7)\u00a0= 5.79, p\u00a0< 0.0001; aftereffect, FR: t(99.7)\u00a0= 3.95, p\u00a0< 0.0001). In contrast, the paws in the opposite diagonal pair maintained their relative phasing throughout the split-belt period (Figure\u00a05G). Since the hind limbs did not show temporal adaptation relative to each other, this implies that either the front fast paw adapted relative to the other three or vice versa. The results of Figure\u00a05 suggest that while spatial adaptation involves changes across multiple limbs, the front, fast limb makes a unique contribution to temporal adaptation. If so, this might imply differential lateralization of spatial and temporal learning within the cerebellum. In particular, given that the cerebellar control of movement is predominantly ipsilateral, we hypothesized that chemogenetic manipulations in interpositus might interfere with temporal adaptation only when injections were made ipsilateral to the fast belt. Similarly, since spatial adaptation appears to involve limbs on both sides of the body, we hypothesized that it might be affected by unilateral chemogenetic manipulation independent of which side of the body experienced the faster belt. We addressed this question by separately analyzing the effects of CNO on spatial and temporal adaptation in the interposed-injected animals under conditions in which the fast belt was either ipsilateral or contralateral to the injection (Figure\u00a06A). As predicted, spatial adaptation was impaired in both the ipsi-fast (coo aftereffect, CNO versus saline: t(9)\u00a0= 3.32, p\u00a0= 0.009) and contra-fast conditions (Figures 6C and 6D, coo aftereffect, CNO versus saline: t(6)\u00a0= 2.81, p\u00a0= 0.03). In contrast, temporal adaptation was impaired with CNO administration only in the ipsi-fast condition (Figure\u00a06E, left; double support aftereffect, CNO versus saline: t(9)\u00a0= 2.63, p\u00a0= 0.02). Temporal adaptation was not different from control in the contra-fast condition (Figure\u00a06E, right; t(6)\u00a0= \u22121.49\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.2). Interestingly, when spatial adaptation was selectively impaired (in the contra-fast condition), we did not observe a compensatory over-adaptation of temporal asymmetry, that could have helped equalize step length. Thus, the separate time courses of spatial and temporal adaptation, together with their differential lateralization both behaviorally and in the cerebellum, suggest that locomotor learning may be achieved through distinct spatial and temporal learning processes with different circuit implementations. Locomotor adaptation in mice represents a form of rapid motor learning that provides good experimental control in the context of a natural behavior that is highly conserved across vertebrates. Mice learn to adapt their locomotor patterns to regain symmetry in\u00a0response to external perturbations in which treadmill belts under each side of the body move at different speeds. Mouse split-belt locomotor adaptation is cerebellum-dependent, specific to measures of interlimb coordination, and has spatial and temporal components with distinct time courses. We identified a sub-region of the cerebellar cortex with Purkinje cells terminating in the interposed nucleus that is required for this form of locomotor learning. Consistent with predictions from the analysis of learned changes in spatial and temporal gait components, unilateral chemogenetic manipulations in this region differentially impairs spatial and temporal adaptation. These findings provide insights into how the movements of four independent limbs are calibrated and coordinated by cerebellar circuits during locomotion. Previous studies have demonstrated locomotor adaptation on a split-belt treadmill in cats (, ) and humans, where it has been extensively studied and is used as a rehabilitation therapy (, ). Here, we implemented split-belt adaptation for the first time in mice, to probe neural circuit mechanisms underlying this form of motor adaptation. Like human learning, mouse locomotor adaptation is specific to interlimb coordination and has spatial and temporal components that adapt at different rates (, , ). Further, split-belt adaptation in mice is dependent on an intact cerebellum, but is insensitive to large lesions of cerebral cortex (Figure\u00a03). Finally, it exhibits high levels of retention and does not generalize to other sensorimotor contexts (i.e., overground walking), features that it shares not only with human split-belt treadmill adaptation (, ), but also various forms of cerebellum-dependent learning (, , , ). The similarities between mouse and human locomotor adaptation are perhaps surprising given the many differences in quadrupedal versus bipedal locomotion. In fact, the only difference we observed between mouse and human adaptation was a lack of savings in mice (). Notably, a lack of savings has been previously observed for other forms of cerebellum-dependent motor adaptation (, , , , ). One intriguing possibility is that savings in human split-belt adaptation may arise as a consequence of the enhanced contribution of cerebral cortex to locomotion in humans and higher vertebrates (). Overall, the many similarities between mouse and human learning suggest that the mechanisms underlying locomotor adaptation may be highly conserved. This opens up the possibility of using genetic tools in mice to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying a form of motor learning that is immediately relevant for human walking, and already used as a rehabilitative therapy. While the basic locomotor rhythm can be generated by the spinal cord alone, it is influenced by sensory input and supraspinal centers that work together to coordinate and modulate locomotion. In the split-belt experiments conducted here, animals exhibit multiple responses to the externally imposed perturbations of belt speed symmetry. There are immediate changes in stride length, for example, that persist throughout the split-belt period; stride symmetry is regained only when the two belt speeds return to symmetrical baseline levels. These adjustments, like the ability of spinal cats to respond to changes in treadmill speed by transitioning from one gait to another, represent reactive changes to belt speed and do not require learning (, , ). Changes to locomotor patterns that are learned and stored in\u00a0the brain, however, are typically characterized by gradual changes over the split-belt period and are accompanied by after-effects once treadmill belt speed symmetry is restored. Like human cerebellar patients (), both pcd and reeler mutants were able to rapidly adjust their stride lengths (a reactive, individual limb parameter) in response to changes in belt speeds but showed specific impairments in learning. However, unlike people with focal cerebellar lesions (), which generally exhibit partial adaptation, the mutants displayed absolutely no evidence of learning, even after prolonged exposure to split-belt walking. The complete abolition of learning demonstrates a remarkably specific role for the cerebellum in learned changes in interlimb coordination, which nicely parallels our previous finding that the visible gait ataxia of pcd mice is associated with specific impairments in interlimb coordination, while stride parameters for individual paws remain intact (). In contrast to the abolition of learning in the cerebellar mutants, we observed intact learning following large lesions of somatomotor cortices. We cannot rule out that a possible role for somatomotor cortex in this form of learning may have been masked by compensatory mechanisms that arose during the days following the lesion. However, we note the comparative inability of any such putative mechanism to compensate for the chronic cerebellar dysfunction in the mutants, both of which present with cerebellar malformation early in development (). With prolonged split-belt exposure, front limbs nearly completely recovered baseline symmetry for both temporal and spatial parameters. In contrast, hindlimb adaptation was incomplete, purely spatial, and occurred at a slower rate than front limbs. One possibility is that the partial spatial adaptation observed in hindlimbs partially reflects adjustments to match the new, learned patterns of front limb motion, rather than representing learning itself. Consistent with this idea, the cerebellum exerts its influence on locomotion mainly via projections to midbrain and brainstem premotor nuclei (), many of which preferentially target forelimb motor neurons (). Front-hind limb matching could then be achieved through long-range cross-segmental spinal communication or other reflexive spinal mechanisms that represent only secondary consequences of cerebellar learning (, ). Possibly consistent with this idea, a previous study failed to find evidence for locomotor adaptation in cats when the speed perturbation was delivered to a single hind limb (), though perturbation of a single front limb in cats does evoke adaptation (, , ). We used a chemogenetic approach to identify a population of Purkinje cells in paravermal cortex projecting to the interposed nucleus that are required for split-belt treadmill adaptation. Because of the lack of savings for this form of learning in mice, we were able to use intra-animal controls to demonstrate that CNO-affected locomotor adaptation only when inhibitory DREADDS were expressed in this cerebellar subregion (). These results were remarkably specific: CNO had no effect on locomotor learning when the same viral strategy was used to target DREADDs to nearby regions. Moreover, the same results were observed regardless of the viral strategy used to deliver the DREADDS to these Purkinje cells (Figure\u00a0S5). The ability to localize split-belt adaptation to such a relatively small cerebellar subregion is perhaps surprising given the widespread representation of sensorimotor signals associated with locomotion across the cerebellum (, , , , , , ). Indeed, many cerebellar regions contribute to locomotion in various ways. Both medial and interposed cerebellar nuclei receive sensory and state information from spinal locomotor circuits, and activity in Purkinje cells projecting to them is modulated with the step cycle (, ). Meanwhile, the lateral cerebellum has been implicated in the overriding of locomotor patterns, such as obstacle avoidance, although damage in this zone does not markedly affect normal gait (, ). However, anatomical and lesion studies, together with patient literature, have demonstrated a clear medial to lateral functional organization within the cerebellum (, ). For instance, the medial zone is highly interconnected with the vestibular system, and accordingly midline damage disrupts balance and posture (, , ). Meanwhile, the lateral cerebellum largely targets thalamocortical pathways, and the intact adaptation we observed with DREADD manipulations here is consistent with the intact learning following widespread lesions of somatomotor cerebral cortex (Figure\u00a03) and with the idea that split-belt adaptation is mediated by more subcortical anatomical pathways (, ). In contrast, damage to intermediate regions cause more subtle deficits that suggest that it is particularly important for precise limb placement and interlimb coordination (, , )\u2014exactly the parameters that undergo learned changes during split-belt adaptation. Several aspects of our data point to distinct circuit mechanisms underlying the spatial and temporal components of the locomotor learning described here (, , , , ). First, as in humans, we found that temporal adaptation proceeds faster than spatial learning. Second, spatial and temporal learning involve differential contributions from the four limbs. While all four limbs appear to undergo spatial adaptation, our analyses suggest that in normal temporal adaptation, the front, fast limb adjusts its timing relative to the other three. Third, consistent with the interlimb coordination analyses, chemogenetic manipulations affected spatial adaptation regardless of the laterality of the injection but only interfered with temporal adaptation when applied ipsilaterally to the fast belt. Finally, manipulations that specifically blocked spatial adaptation did not result in a compensatory over-adaptation of temporal parameters that might be expected to occur if step length itself was being optimized (Figure\u00a02G). While the specific error signals that drive locomotor adaptation are not known, the fact that spatial and temporal learning appear to be able to occur independently suggest that they may represent adaptive responses to separate error signals. The dissociability of the spatial and temporal components of locomotor learning shown here is particularly interesting in light of previous experiments demonstrating a role for the cerebellum in precise timing (, , ), as well as studies that have suggested distinct circuit mechanisms for timing and amplitude in other cerebellar learning tasks (, ). It will be interesting to further map the downstream connectivity of cerebellar interposed projections to better understand split-belt adaptation and coordination across the limbs in space and time. It is possible that space and time will be further segregated in specific neural populations within the cerebellar cortex, interposed nucleus, and/or downstream circuitry.

Mice were housed in institutional standard cages (5 animals per cage) on a reversed 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with ad libitum access to water and food. Heterozygous Purkinje cell degeneration and reeler mice on a C57BL/6 background were obtained from Jackson labs (pcd: #0537, B6.BRAgtpbp1pcd/J; reeler: #000235,B6C3Fe a/a-Relnrl/J). L7-cre mice used in DCN DREADDs manipulations were also obtained from Jackson labs (#\u00a0004146, Tg(Pcp2-cre)1Amc/J). All stereotactic surgery was performed under isoflurane anesthesia and buprenorphine (0.1\u00a0mg/kg) was administered for postoperative analgesia. Adult male and female mice (between 2.5-5\u00a0months) were used for all experiments. We developed a transparent split-belt treadmill for mice that provides high resolution readouts of locomotor behavior using the previously described noninvasive, markerless LocoMouse tracking system (; https://github.com/careylab/LocoMouse). Briefly, mice were filmed while walking inside a narrow acrylic corridor (30\u00a0\u00d7 4\u00a0cm). Transparent mylar belts were driven using two DC motors (Maxon, DCX 22 S) with high-resolution encoders and an Escon 50/5 motor controller (Maxon). Each treadmill belt was 1.9\u00a0cm wide and no physical barrier or gap separated the two belts from each other. A 45\u00b0 angled mirror below the setup allowed for simultaneous collection of side and bottom views () using a single camera. Lighting consisted of a matrix of LEDs that emitted cool white light positioned to maximize contrast and reduce reflection. Images were acquired at 330 fps using a monochrome FireWire camera (Pike F-032 B/C, Allied Vision Technologies, https://www.alliedvision.com) and custom-software written in Labview. Mice walked across a glass corridor, 66.5\u00a0cm long and 4.5\u00a0cm wide (). A mirror was placed at 45 deg under the mouse, so that a single high-speed camera (AVT Bonito, 1440x250 pixels, 400 frames per second) recorded both bottom and side views. Individual trials consisted of single crossings of the corridor. Mice freely initiated trials by walking back and forth between two dark \u2018home\u2019 boxes on each end of the corridor. Data collection was performed in LABVIEW and was automatically triggered by infrared sensors that detected when the mouse entered and exited the corridor. Animals were handled and acclimated to the treadmill prior to starting experiments. Treadmill acclimation consisted of 3-4 daily sessions of tied-belt walking (equal speeds on the two sides) until mice walked without turning, maintained a regular position, and were able to keep up with the range of belt speeds used in the adaptation protocol. Experimental mice were freely moving and ran without reinforcement. Although there was no barrier between belts, the narrow belt widths prevent prolonged paw crosses to belts on the opposite side. We ensured adherence to imposed treadmill speeds by monitoring the average paw speeds during the stance period. All split-belt locomotor adaptation experiments consisted of \u2018baseline\u2019 tied, split-belt, and \u2018washout\u2019 tied belt trials. All trials were one minute in duration, with brief periods in which the motors were off, in between trials. Trials were manually initiated in rapid succession. This intertrial period was approximately 1-5\u00a0s and mice typically waited in the front of the corridor for the next trial to start. Sessions consisted of 10-23 one-minute trials. Single session split-belt adaptation protocols (Figures 1, 3, 4, and 6) consisted of 1-3 baseline trials, 8 or 13 split-belt trials and 8 or 10 washout trials. Longer, multi-session protocols (Figures 2, 3, and 5) consisted of 10 trials per day: session 1: 3 tied, 7 split; sessions 2-3: 10 split; session 4: 3 split, 7 tied; session 5: 10 tied. Tied-belt baseline trials were at an intermediate speed between slow and fast sides (0.275\u00a0m/s). Split-belt trial speeds were at a 2.14:1 ratio: 0.175\u00a0m/s (slow) and 0.375\u00a0m/s (fast). For pcd and reeler mutant mice, the overall belt speeds were reduced but a similar ratio between fast and slow was maintained (tied: 0.2\u00a0m/s; slow: 0.125\u00a0m/s fast: 0.275\u00a0m/s). Our extensive experience, including but not limited to the data presented in Figures 4, 6, and S4 clearly indicates that there is no difference in learning following repeated adaptation protocols in individual animals, as long as learning is washed out completely in between experiments. Therefore, in all experiments involving surgical intervention, we used within-animal controls, to take advantage of the ability to directly compare learning under different experimental conditions in the same mice. Intracranial injections were performed using a Nanoject II (Drummond) and 30-40\u00a0\u03bcm pulled and beveled glass pipettes. We injected retrograde, double floxed Gi-coupled hM4D DREADD (rAAV2 retro-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry; addgene plasmid #44362, ) into the deep cerebellar nuclei of L7-cre animals to target Purkinje cells terminating in each nucleus. For pan-neuronal cerebellar cortex injections (Figure\u00a0S5), we injected AAV-hSyn-hM4D(Gi)-mcherry (addgene plasmid #50475, ). The following coordinates were used to target each of the deep cerebellar nuclei: medial: \u22126.24 AP, 0.5 ML, 2.2 DV; interposed: \u22126.24 AP, 1.6 ML, 2-2.3 DV; Lateral: \u22126 AP, 2.26 M, 2.2 DV. Anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) coordinates are given relative to bregma. Dorsoventral (DV) are relative to the surface of the brain. The volume of all injections was between 100-200 nL and were on the right side. Mice used for these experiments were between 10-12\u00a0weeks old at time of injection. Split belt adaptation experiments were run two weeks later to allow time for virus expression. For CNO injections, we used dosages of 10\u00a0mg/kg and waited 30-40\u00a0min post intraperitoneal injection before starting the experiment (). For all animals, learning was tested in the saline condition before the administration of CNO, and the ipsi and contra-fast conditions (i.e., fast belt ipsi- or contralateral relative to the injection site) were tested in separate groups of animals. Mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde 3-4\u00a0weeks post-injection. Prior to aspirations, mice were habituated to the split-belt setup and underwent pre-lesion split-belt adaption to ascertain baseline learning, followed by complete washout. Somatomotor cortical lesions were performed by controlled vacuum aspirations via stereotaxic surgery with coordinates \u03bc 3.5\u00a0mm from midline;\u00a0+ 2.5 to \u22121.5\u00a0mm AP from Bregma; - 2.5\u00a0mm DV from brain surface. These coordinates were chosen to cover the full extent of forelimb primary motor and somatosensory cortices (). While all lesions spanned large parts of primary motor and somatosensory cortex, a few animals had larger lesions encompassing parts of the striatum. Mice were then housed in isolation and received injections of 0.01ml/g glucose and lactated Ringer\u2019s solution for two consecutive days post-surgery. Animals were allowed to recover before being re-habituated to the setup via a ten-trial tied-belt session. Split-belt locomotor adaptation took place five days following the lesions. Paw, nose and tail tracks were obtained using LocoMouse tracker: an open-source, markerless tracking algorithm described previously (https://github.com/careylab/LocoMouse; ). X-position (bottom view) tracks were first subdivided into stride cycles by automatic detection of swing and stance points using a simple peak detection algorithm. Since our experiments use unrestrained animals that show variability in behavior, we analyzed the statistics of incoming strides to remove periods of a) inactivity or other non-locomotor behavior and b) errors in tracking (Figure\u00a0S1). Stride length, swing and stance durations were computed for all detected strides. We removed strides with values in these parameters that were > 2.5 standard deviations from the mean of distributions composed of tied belt trials with slow (0.125\u00a0m/s), intermediate (0.275\u00a0m/s) and fast belt (0.375\u00a0m/s) speeds. In addition, we removed tracks in rare cases in which physically impossible configurations were detected (e.g., left-right or front-hind paw inversions). When outlier and tracking errors were detected for a single limb, we removed tracks for all four limbs for that stride, so as not to interfere with interlimb coordination calculations. On average, 70.5% (Figure\u00a01 data) of tracks were retained, resulting in an average of 179.4\u00a0\u00b1 36.96 (SD) strides each minute. The number of strides kept did not vary systematically throughout the course of the experiments (Figures S1E and S1F), and the magnitude of learning obtained was not related to overall stride count (Figure\u00a0S1G). To determine the reasons for data exclusion, we manually annotated mouse behavior during the excluded epochs in 15 videos from the data shown in Figure\u00a01 (Figure\u00a0S1; 6 mice, 707 removed epochs, 248985 excluded frames). Excluded epochs were classified as having been removed for a) episodes of non-walking behavior (mouse rearing, grooming or sitting), or b) errors in tracking (mouse was walking but tracks drifted from paws). In our validated movies, we kept an average of 73% of the tracks per one-minute trial; 23% were removed for mouse behavior (not walking) and 3.8% were removed for tracking errors (Figures S1A and S1B). Finally, the tracking quality of kept frames was validated in a subset of movies (7 movies, both split and tied trials) from the experiment shown in Figure\u00a01. Frames (n\u00a0= 799) were randomly selected. Each of the four paws was labeled twice (in the bottom view) by the same person to estimate the variability in human manual annotation. Manually labeled data was then compared with tracks from LocoMouse. On average LocoMouse performed close to human levels of accuracy (Figure\u00a0S1C). Errors were non-directional and tracks were within the size of a paw > 90% of the time (Figure\u00a0S1D). All calculations rely on bottom view x-position tracks and are computed for each stride. We define a full stride cycle as the period from stance onset (limb touchdown) to the next stance onset (Figure\u00a0S2A). Calculations for individual and interlimb coordination parameters are defined below and illustrated in Figures S2B (individual limbs) and S2C (interlimb coordination). We use fast limbs to refer to the limbs that are driven by the faster belt during the split belt period; slow limbs refer to the limbs driven by the slow belt. Measures of asymmetry are always calculated as the fast minus the slow side for contralaterally homologous limbs on the same girdle. stride duration: time between two consecutive stance onsets. duty factor: percentage of stride cycle spent in stance\u00a0= [stance duration / stride duration] \u00d7 100 stride length\u00a0= X(st) \u2013 X(sw), where X(st) is limb x position at stance and X(sw) is limb x position at swing onset step length: displacement of one limb relative to its contralateral homolog at stance onset step lengthfast\u00a0= Xf(stf) \u2013 Xs(stf), where Xf(stf) is the fast limb x position at time of fast limb stance onset and Xs(stf) is slow limb x\u00a0position at time of fast limb stance onset.

Statistical analyses were conducted using MATLAB and R. For basic adaptation analyses (Figures 1, 2, and 5), we used mixed models to test for fixed effects of experimental phase on the asymmetry of each gait parameter (either stride length, step length, center of oscillation, % double support). Experimental phase had five levels including baseline, early split, late split, early washout and late washout. Baseline was the average across all pre-split, tied belt trials (or 6\u00a0s bins). Early and late split were the first and last split belt trials (or 6\u00a0s bins). Early and late washout was the first or last post-split tied belt trial (or 6\u00a0s bin). We specified random slopes and intercepts models and included mouse/subject as a random covariate using the lme4 package (). We report F statistics with Satterthwaite degrees of freedom correction. Unless otherwise specified, reported post hoc analyses are t tests with Tukey corrections for multiple comparisons and were conducted using the lsmeans package in R (). All statistical comparisons are conducted on animal average (i.e., each animal has one observation per level(s) of the independent variable). Throughout the paper, statistics involving post hoc contrasts (t statistics) are reported alone; omnibus tests (ANOVA, F statistics) and all other statistical comparisons can be found in Table S1. Statistical significance is coded throughout as follows: \u2217\u2217\u2217 p \u2264 0.001; \u2217\u2217 p \u2264 0.01; \u2217 p \u2264 0.05. The mixed model for analyses of retention (Figure\u00a0S4A) included two levels: session (1-3) and trial position (last of previous session and first of current session) to look for significant changes in step length asymmetry from day to day. The mixed model for analysis of savings (Figure\u00a0S4D) included two independent variables, the experimental phase (5 levels) and the adaptation repetition, (Adaptrep; 2\u00a0levels: initial and re-adaptation). For the individual limb analyses in Figure\u00a05, we used mixed models to test for differences from zero across the four paws (or zero reference) and experimental phases (\u0394 over split trials, aftereffect relative to baseline) on center of oscillation or stance phase. Omnibus tests (F statistics) reflect differences between the four paws and/or from zero. For these analyses, we specified random slopes and intercepts models and included mouse/subject as a random covariate. Post hoc analyses tested significant differences from zero in each of the four paws, with Tukey corrections for multiple comparisons, and were conducted with the lsmeans package in R, as above. For data comparing mutants or surgically manipulated mice (Figures 3, 4, and 6), we compared the aftereffects (early washout \u2013 baseline) in experimental versus control groups with t tests (paired, when applicable) for a parsimonious metric of overall adaptation. For exponential fitting of adaptation time courses (Figures 2 and 5), we compared fits of single and double exponential equations by examining the r-square and distribution of residuals for the two fit types. Single and double exponential equations fits were equivalent for the split-belt period while double exponentials better captured the rapid initial descent of the washout period. We used the following equations to fit the data: single exponential: step length asymmetry\u00a0= a-b \u00d7 exp(strides/ \u03bb), where a and b are constants, and \u03bb is the decay constant, or number of strides to reach 63% of final adaptation; double exponential: step length asymmetry\u00a0= a \u00d7 exp(b \u00d7 strides)\u00a0+ c \u00d7 exp(d \u00d7 strides). We report the reciprocal of b and d as Kfast and Kslow, respectively. Simulated strides were generated to create a predicted mapping of step length over many combinations of spatial and temporal shifts (Figure\u00a02G). Stride duration, stride length and duty factor were fixed to the value of the first split belt trial. By fixing individual limb parameters, we were able to estimate the independent and isolated effects of spatial (center of oscillation) and temporal (stance phase or double support) shifts on step length asymmetry (see also Figures 2A\u2013C and S2C). Given the fixed relationship of individual limb parameters (Figure\u00a0S2B), we generated strides (stance time 1 to stance time 2) by the following relationships: For temporal parameters, stance time 1 and stance time 2 were set to be arbitrary values whose difference equaled the stride duration. Swing time 1 was then defined as stance time 1\u00a0+ duty factor x stride duration. For spatial parameters, the swing and stance position were set to be arbitrary values whose differences equaled the stride length. We then linearly interpolated between these swing and stance positions to generate simulated strides. One limb was shifted in small increments relative to the other in in space (\u22125 to 25 units) and in time (0 to 1 stride duration) and step length, double support and center of oscillation asymmetry was computed for each shift. To test the fit of the model to the experimental data (Figure\u00a02H), we matched experimental measurements of % double support and center of oscillation asymmetry values with their closest simulation values and compared the actual step length values to the simulated step length asymmetry for that spatiotemporal combination. Contributions of spatial and temporal parameters to step length asymmetry were estimated by calculating slopes for unit shifts in each parameter versus step length, while holding the other constant. For Figure\u00a02I, we used the analytical model of , which provides a set of equations to parses the mm contributions of spatial and temporal parameters to step length asymmetry. In this framework, step length asymmetry\u00a0= step position\u00a0+ step time\u00a0+ step velocity. We refer to the step position term as spatial adaptation and the sum of step time and step velocity as temporal adaptation, respectively.

Spatiotemporal dynamics of a neural system are shaped by structural constraints on interactions among the system\u2019s components, as well as intrinsic dynamical properties of those components. An open question in systems neuroscience is how areal heterogeneity of local circuit properties across cortex shapes large-scale structure-function relationships. Hierarchical organization provides a parsimonious principle for anatomical properties of inter-areal connections in primate cortex (, , ). Anatomically defined cortical hierarchy aligns with sensory processing hierarchies, with early sensory areas at lower levels and association areas at higher levels (, ). Functional and dynamical properties (, ), as well as specialization of cortical microcircuitry (, ), vary across hierarchical levels, yet it is unclear how hierarchical specialization of local circuit properties across human cortex shapes the large-scale organization of neural dynamics. Advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have provided noninvasive methods for characterizing large-scale connectivity in the human brain at the structural and functional levels. Structural connectivity (SC) is often inferred from diffusion MRI (dMRI), which aims to quantify the density of anatomical fibers linking brain regions. The functional organization of human brain activity has been studied most extensively through functional MRI (fMRI) measurements of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals. Resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) provides a measure of temporal correlations in spontaneous activity between regions and has revealed an intrinsic architecture of the human brain (). Recent findings suggest that hierarchy may be a useful principle for rs-FC patterns in human cortex (), including capturing sensory-association differences in inter-individual variation (, ) and dysfunction in disease states (, ). Computational models of large-scale brain circuits propose dynamical circuit mechanisms linking the structural and functional organization of human cortex. In a major class of biophysically based dynamical models, large-scale patterns of rs-FC arise through physiological dynamics of local cortical circuits interconnected through long-range structural connections (, ). Importantly, simulated functional connectivity (FC) in these models is shaped by the physiological properties of the local circuits, such as strengths of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections (, , ). However, the role of inter-areal heterogeneity of local circuit properties has not been systematically studied in large-scale models of human cortex. Microcircuit specialization across human cortex can be informed by structural neuroimaging measures of cortical architectural variation. In particular, the MRI-derived contrast ratio of T1- to T2-weighted (T1w/T2w) maps has been proposed to provide an in\u00a0vivo measure of intracortical myelin content (, ). Cortical myelin content has been observed to correlate with a prominent sensory-association gradient in rs-FC variation (, ).  found that the T1w/T2w map provides a noninvasive neuroimaging proxy measure of anatomical hierarchy in primate cortex. Multiple aspects of hierarchical specialization, including in excitatory and inhibitory microcircuitry, vary along this cortical axis. In the human cortex, the T1w/T2w map captures the dominant areal pattern of variation in gene expression (). We hypothesized that hierarchical specialization of local microcircuitry across human cortex, as captured by T1w/T2w maps, shapes the large-scale organization of rs-FC. To address these issues, we developed a large-scale cortical circuit model incorporating hierarchical heterogeneity of local microcircuit properties and quantitatively fit the model using multimodal human neuroimaging data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) (). We used the T1w/T2w map to parametrize hierarchical heterogeneity in local synaptic strengths across cortical areas. Compared to a model with homogeneous microcircuit properties across areas, this heterogeneous model better captured empirical rs-FC patterns, with the T1w/T2w map providing a preferential axis for areal heterogeneity. Furthermore, the model predicts a hierarchical axis of specialization for spectral features of higher-frequency neural dynamics, which we found to be consistent with resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG). Our study provides a computational framework to study how areal specialization of microcircuitry shapes large-scale network function of the human brain, opening applications to neuropsychiatric disorders and pharmacological effects. We first describe the computational framework for the large-scale circuit model of human cortex, incorporating areal heterogeneity of local properties, which we applied to the HCP multimodal neuroimaging dataset from a large number of healthy subjects (n\u00a0= 334) (Figure\u00a01A). The cortical surface was parcellated into multiple contiguous areas. Here, we applied a recently developed multimodal parcellation from the HCP, which yielded 180 cortical areas per hemisphere (). Each cortical area was modeled as a local circuit comprising excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons coupled through recurrent synaptic interactions, with neurophysiologically interpretable parameters governing local dynamics, as described below. Areas in the large-scale network interact via structured long-range excitatory projections constrained by a matrix, derived here from dMRI and probabilistic tractography (Figure\u00a0S1). We simulated only within-hemisphere interactions to focus model fitting on capturing the network structure of rs-FC and because dMRI is limited in mapping callosal projections. The SC matrix thereby provides a structural scaffold for long-range neural interactions in the model. The model simulates time-varying activity of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations in a local circuit for each cortical area. For computational tractability of model fitting, as well as\u00a0mathematical analysis of the system, we used a reduced mean-field approximation of synaptic dynamics for each neuronal population in the network (, , ). Populations receive synaptic input from multiple sources, with contributions from the fluctuating background, local recurrent connections, and long-range connections from other areas, which induces structured correlated fluctuations across the network. Each local node is characterized by two synaptic parameters, which set the strengths of local excitatory-to-excitatory  and excitatory-to-inhibitory  connections. The inhibitory-to-excitatory strength  was set to maintain a uniform baseline firing rate, dependent on the other parameters () (Tables 1 and 2). Global coupling parameters  scale the strengths of long-range interactions within the left and right hemispheres. Synaptic activity is used to simulate the BOLD signal using the mechanistic Balloon-Windkessel model for the hemodynamic response (, ). The model can thereby yield a simulated BOLD FC matrix, which can be compared to empirical BOLD rs-FC data. The neurophysiological model parameters can then be optimized to provide the best fit to empirical rs-FC. A key extension to the model framework introduced here is a hypothesis-driven approach to incorporate areal heterogeneity of local circuit properties (Figure\u00a01B). We compared performance of the circuit model with homogeneous and heterogeneous local circuit parameters. In the \u201chomogeneous\u201d model, synaptic parameters were uniform across cortical areas, and its four parameters were optimized globally (, , , and ). In contrast, in the \u201cheterogeneous\u201d model, parameter values (here,  and ) can vary across cortical areas, parametrized according to a predefined heterogeneity map. The heterogeneity map thereby constrains the topography of local circuit specialization in the heterogeneous model. We hypothesized that cortical hierarchy provides a principle describing specialization of microcircuit properties across cortical areas that shapes large-scale functional dynamics. We therefore sought to implement the model with a heterogeneity map that reflects a hierarchical ordering of cortical areas. Because anatomical hierarchy is derived through invasive tract-tracing, which has precluded direct investigation in human cortex, we sought a noninvasive proxy measure.  found that the MRI-derived T1w/T2w map is negatively correlated with anatomical hierarchy in macaque cortex and that specialization in multiple aspects of cortical microcircuitry were found to correlate with the T1w/T2w map (Figure\u00a01C). In particular, they found a negative correlation between T1w/T2w values and the number of spines on pyramidal cell dendrites, which can be interpreted as a microanatomical correlate of recurrent excitatory synaptic strengths (, ), suggesting stronger values of  in association areas with low T1w/T2w values. In human cortex, areas can be contextualized in terms of coherent resting-state networks (RSNs) associated with different sensory and higher-order association functions. We assigned all areas to 8 canonical RSNs comprising three sensory networks (visual, somatosensory, and auditory) and five association networks (frontoparietal, cingulo-opercular, default mode, dorsal attention, and ventral attention) () (Figure\u00a01D). We observed that T1w/T2w map values were significantly higher in sensory networks than in association networks (, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) () (Figure\u00a01E). In further support of the T1w/T2w map as a proxy measure of hierarchical microcircuit specialization across human cortex,  analyzed the topography of cortical gene expression and found that the T1w/T2w map captures the dominant spatial pattern of gene expression variation in human cortex. These findings suggest that the T1w/T2w map may capture a key axis of areal heterogeneity across cortex, which we quantitatively instantiated in the model. We derived a hierarchical heterogeneity map by rescaling and inverting the raw T1w/T2w map, such that its values are relatively uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, with high-T1w/T2w sensory areas at low map values and low-T1w/T2w association areas at high map values (Figure\u00a0S2). Local synaptic strengths ( and ) were then parametrized for each area  as an affine function of the heterogeneity map values , characterized by an intercept  and scale factor :  (Figure\u00a01B). Use of a heterogeneity map in model fitting thereby enables hypothesis-driven investigation of areal differences in local circuit properties while increasing model complexity by only a single additional parameter for each heterogeneous property. We quantitatively fit the models described above to rs-FC data. To estimate the optimal model parameter values, we used hierarchical population Monte Carlo (hPMC), a Bayesian optimization technique (Figure S2C). hPMC approximates the posterior distribution in parameter space by iteratively drawing a set of model parameters (i.e., \u201cparticles\u201d) from the proposed distribution to minimize a distance measure between model and empirical data. We fit the model parameters to maximize the average Pearson correlation between model and empirical FC across subjects (n\u00a0= 334). To calculate the model FC, we used an analytical approximation of linearized system dynamics, which enables computationally efficient calculation of dynamical features of the system, including the FC matrix (, ) (Figure\u00a0S3). Here, we extended this approach to include linearization of the Balloon-Windkessel hemodynamic model for direct calculation of the BOLD FC matrix. This analytical calculation of BOLD FC provided computational efficiency needed for parameter fitting while producing a highly accurate estimate of simulated BOLD FC ( for simulations of duration \u223c1 h, i.e. 4,800 repetition times [TRs]) (Figure\u00a0S3). The fitting procedure produced the approximated posterior distribution of the optimal model parameters. To assess parameter identifiability, we performed hPMC fitting on model-generated FC matrices from the approximate posterior of the heterogeneous model. The fitting procedure recovered parameters well, with and without observation noise over the objective FC (Figure\u00a0S4). We tested whether hierarchical heterogeneity improves similarity between empirical rs-FC and fit model FC patterns compared to a homogeneous model with uniform properties across cortical areas. Figures 2A\u20132D show empirical group-averaged SC and FC matrices and particle-averaged FC matrices for the homogeneous and heterogeneous models. We quantified model performance using the goodness of fit (i.e., squared Pearson correlation coefficient) of empirical FC, averaged across subjects, captured by the model FC, averaged across samples from the approximate posterior distribution. We found that the similarity between empirical and model FC was significantly higher in the heterogeneous model  than in the homogeneous model  (, dependent correlation test) (Figure\u00a02G). Both models yielded higher FC similarity compared to the SC-FC similarity as a baseline  (, dependent correlation test). The fit between SC and model FC was significantly lower for the heterogenous model (, ) than the homogeneous model (, ) (, dependent correlation test), which suggests that areal heterogeneity can help to explain FC patterns not accounted for by SC (). We tested this suggestion with a multiple regression model of FC with SC as an additional predictor. Regression coefficients of both models were significant . However, the heterogeneous model FC improved the explained variance by  relative to a reduced model including only SC, compared to only  for the homogeneous model. The optimal fit parameters for the heterogenous model exhibited a large scaling of local recurrent excitatory-to-excitatory synaptic strengths  across the hierarchical heterogeneity map  (Figure\u00a02H). We tested the impact of hierarchical heterogeneity in other, non-weight parameters, specifically the excitatory and inhibitory time constants (i.e.,  and ). This model did not outperform the heterogeneous model based on synaptic weights (; , dependent correlation test). We also investigated hierarchical heterogeneity of local self-coupling in more abstract dynamical models, specifically an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model and a simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) model. For both models, heterogeneity substantially improved model fit (OU:  for heterogeneous versus  for homogeneous; SAR:  versus ), but neither outperformed the heterogeneous circuit model (, dependent correlation test). To provide mechanistic insight into the models, we examined the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the linearized dynamical system (Figure\u00a0S5). In the homogeneous model, the leading eigenvectors (i.e., with largest eigenvalues and longest timescales) exhibited a global activation pattern, whereas the heterogeneous model showed spatially structured leading eigenvectors. These leading eigenvectors exhibited a network-dependent hierarchical organization rather than a strictly monotonic relationship with the T1w/T2w. The slowest eigenvector weights showed a strong positive correlation with T1w/T2w map in the visual RSN, but not globally, peaking at lateral inferior parietal and lateral prefrontal cortex, consistent with the visual hierarchical organization. Because the heterogeneous model has more parameters than the homogeneous model (6 versus 4), we tested that fit improvement was not due to over-fitting with the more expressive model. Implementing repeated random subsampling cross-validation, we repeated the fitting procedure for a randomly selected subset of 80% of the subjects (267), and measured the model fit to the remaining 20% of subjects (67). Across 100 cross-validation samples, the predictive power of the heterogeneous model  always outperformed the homogeneous model . In addition, we tested whether the improved model fit in the heterogeneous model can be explained by known non-neural confounds in rs-fMRI, such as head motion, variations in heart rate, and respiration. If the improved fit of the heterogeneous model is due to its capture of non-neural FC contributions, then individual differences in non-neural measures should explain individual differences in the improvement in empirical-model FC similarity for heterogeneous versus homogeneous models. The heterogeneous model improved the FC fit for 98.5% of the 334 subjects. We performed a regression analysis across subjects on the difference in model-empirical fit between heterogeneous and homogeneous models. A constant term (i.e., without non-neural measures) explained 80% of the total sum of squares, and inclusion of individual non-neural measures improved the explained variance by only 1.5%. This suggests that the substantial improvement in fitting by the heterogeneous model is not attributable to non-neural confounds. Does the T1w/T2w-based hierarchical heterogeneity map provide a preferential axis of cortical specialization in comparison to other possible heterogeneity maps? To address this question, we repeated the model fitting procedure for a single hemisphere using the T1w/T2w-based heterogeneity map and 500 randomized surrogate heterogeneity maps. Because T1w/T2w map values are spatially autocorrelated, we developed a procedure to generate surrogate maps that randomly vary in their particular topographies but preserve the general spatial autocorrelation structure of the T1w/T2w-based map (Figures 3A\u20133C). We found that the model fit of the surrogate maps was slightly higher than that of the homogeneous model, with an average correlation  for surrogates versus  for the homogeneous model. Nonetheless, among all surrogate maps, the T1w/T2w-derived map exhibited significantly higher model fit than surrogates (,  for the heterogenous model) (Figure\u00a03D). Furthermore, the model fit using surrogate heterogeneity maps was significantly correlated with their similarity to the T1w/T2w-based heterogeneity map (Figure\u00a03E). To test the importance of finer gradients within the T1w/T2w map, we tested an alternative model with a heterogeneity map defined by two categorical levels for sensory versus association networks. This categorical model performed better than the homogeneous model but worse than the T1w/T2w-based heterogeneity map model (;  for both, dependent correlation test). These findings suggest that the T1w/T2w map provides a preferential neural axis for cortical microcircuit specialization, in line with prior empirical characterization of microanatomical and transcriptional specialization along the T1w/T2w map (). We examined how the improved performance of the hierarchical heterogeneous model was distributed across different functionally relevant cortical networks and whether this was due to capturing rs-FC patterns within networks or across networks. We calculated the model-empirical FC similarity for each of eight RSNs (three sensory, five association), decomposing its FC pattern into within-network and across-network components (Figures 4A and 4D). We found that both within- and across-network fits to empirical FC were higher in the heterogeneous model than in the homogeneous model for all RSNs (Figures 4B\u20134F), with association RSNs showing a larger improvement than sensory RSNs in within-network similarity. Among the association RSNs, the frontoparietal (FPN) and cingulo-opercular (CON) networks exhibited large increases in both within- and across-network fits. These results show that incorporating hierarchical heterogeneity not only improves the whole-cortex model FC fit but also preferentially improves the within-network model FC fit in association networks. The RSN analyses presented above suggest that hierarchical heterogeneity may allow the model to capture important rs-FC differences between sensory and association networks. To investigate sensory-association differences more directly, we studied the topography of global brain connectivity (GBC), a measure of global FC strength for each area (Figure\u00a05A). Studies have found GBC to be an informative measure of rs-FC alterations in psychiatric disorders (, ) and individual differences in cognition (). Furthermore, there is evidence that the cortical topography of pharmacologically induced changes in GBC is aligned with the topography of gene expression for the targeted receptor (). We therefore examined whether hierarchical heterogeneity of circuit properties in the model shapes the cortical GBC topography in healthy subjects. We found that GBC, calculated within cortex, was significantly different across sensory and association RSNs, with higher GBC in sensory areas than in association areas (, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) (Figures 5B and 5C). The correlation with empirical GBC was significantly higher for the heterogeneous model  than that for the homogeneous model  (, dependent correlation test) (Figures 5D\u20135F). Notably, SC input strengths are normalized such that the net in-degree is homogeneous across nodes, in both models. We further assessed these results by examining relationships between model GBC, degree of the binarized SC graph, and weights of the slowest eigenvectors (Figures S5N\u2013S5P). The homogeneous model GBC was strongly correlated with degree of binarized SC  (). In contrast, the heterogeneous model GBC was mostly driven by the eigenvector of the slowest Jacobian mode . These findings suggest that hierarchical heterogeneity of local circuit properties may play a role in shaping sensory-association differences in the large-scale organization of rs-FC. Cortical rs-FC patterns vary across individuals.  characterized the degree to which cortical areas vary in their FC profiles across subjects and found a marked hierarchical difference across RSNs; sensorimotor regions exhibited low inter-individual variation in FC, whereas association regions exhibited higher variation. As noted above, our model fitting approach uses hPMC to fit a posterior distribution in parameter space to the full set of FC patterns across subjects in the HCP dataset. Of note, particles share the same structural connectivity matrix and heterogeneity map and differ only in their synaptic parameter values. We can therefore study whether the best-fit model exhibits hierarchical differences in FC variation across particles drawn from the approximated posterior distribution, comparable to the FC variation across subjects in the empirical data. We quantified the variability within the population as the dissimilarity of FC patterns across individuals, following the approach of . In the model, the dissimilarity of FC patterns was calculated across 1,000 particles that were sampled from the posterior distribution (Figure\u00a06A). In this study, model particles all used the same SC matrix, averaged over subjects. This allowed our analyses to isolate potential contributions to individual variation in rs-FC arising from variation in physiological circuit properties. We note this is one potential source of variation and that individual differences in SC likely also shape differences in FC (). Across the 334 subjects, we found that the inter-individual dissimilarity was higher in frontal and temporal brain regions (Figure\u00a06B). The inter-individual dissimilarity in association RSNs was on average higher than in sensory RSNs (, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Z score  and  for association and sensory RSNs, respectively). Similar to the empirical data, the heterogeneous model showed higher inter-particle dissimilarity in frontal association areas (Figure\u00a06C). The topography of empirical dissimilarity was positively and moderately correlated with that of the heterogeneous model , unlike with the homogeneous model . The heterogeneous model exhibits a similar hierarchical distinction in dissimilarity, with higher inter-particle variability in association regions than in sensory regions, whereas no such pattern is present in the homogeneous model (, network  model type ANOVA, ) (Figure\u00a06D). We also compared the SD of each FC connection across subjects or particles and found that the model-empirical similarity of this measure was higher for the heterogeneous model than for the homogeneous model ( versus ; , dependent correlation test). Incorporation of heterogeneity expanded the dimensionality of fitting to the empirical population (Figures 6F\u20136I). We applied principal-component analysis (PCA) to the distribution of model particles from the hPMC fitting in the fit parameter space. The\u00a0homogeneous model exhibited only a single axis of particle variation in its four-dimensional parameter space, indicating one-dimensional expressiveness of the synaptic parameters. In\u00a0contrast, the heterogeneous model exhibited four effective dimensions of variation in its six-dimensional parameter space. Hierarchical heterogeneity of local recurrent strengths therefore contributes degrees of freedom that substantially increase model expressiveness. These findings suggest that hierarchical heterogeneity may contribute to individual variation in the functional organization of cortex. How does hierarchical heterogeneity in the model shape neural dynamics across a wide range of timescales? The results described above examined simulated BOLD signals from a hemodynamic model that are driven by synaptic activity in the neural circuits. Cortical areas differ in the spectral properties of their intrinsic dynamics at rest (, , , ). In local circuit models, synaptic strengths can shape these spectral properties (, ). We therefore sought to examine in the model how hierarchical heterogeneity produces specific areal topographies of neural dynamics across multiple timescales. We first characterized the dynamical repertoire of the local microcircuit model at each node in the large-scale network as a function of the recurrent excitatory strengths onto excitatory and inhibitory neurons:  and  (Figures 7A and S6). As  increases, there is a threshold value (i.e., a bifurcation point) beyond which the system\u2019s baseline state destabilizes (). When  is large, the system exhibits another dynamical regime in which the system\u2019s dynamics undergo damped oscillations. In the heterogeneous model, areas are hierarchically dispersed along a line in the  parameter space, whereas in the homogeneous model, all areas are set at the same point. We found that the optimal parameters of both models were close to the bifurcations (Figures 7B and 7C), in line with prior studies (, ). We characterized the power spectral density (PSD) of the underlying synaptic activity in the models (Figures 7D and 7E). The homogeneous model exhibits PSDs that did not differ substantially across areas. In contrast, the heterogeneous model exhibits gradual shifts in PSD profiles across hierarchical levels. To examine the contributions of inter-areal connectivity to these dynamics, we simulated the effect of \u201cdisconnection\u201d in the network (Figure\u00a0S7). We found that long-range connections primarily shape low-frequency power ( Hz), suggesting differential contribution of local and long-range inputs in shaping spectral features. Distance-dependent synaptic delays in long-range projections did not substantially affect simulated PSD or BOLD FC patterns (Figure\u00a0S7). These results suggest that hierarchical heterogeneity shapes the spatial topography of spectral features across multiple timescales. We tested the model prediction that spectral features are hierarchically organized using the PSD from resting-state MEG. The empirical MEG-derived PSD of many areas exhibits a prominent alpha-band peak with a posterior-anterior topography (Figure\u00a08A). To remove strong topographic effects of alpha- and beta-band peaks, we fit the MEG PSD to its 0-Hz, alpha and beta peak Lorentzians and removed the alpha and beta Lorentzians from the PSD (Figures 8B and S8). We then performed PCA on the normalized PSDs (see STAR Methods). The first principal axis is the spectral pattern that captures the most variation in PSDs across areas ( for the empirical MEG) (Figure\u00a08C). The first principal component (PC-1) is the areal map whose values are the loadings of spectral variation for each area onto the first principal axis (Figure\u00a08D). We found that the PC-1 map was significantly correlated with the T1w/T2w map (, , against 500 randomized surrogate maps with matching spatial\u00a0autocorrelation). These results show that spectral features in resting-state MEG exhibits topographic signatures of hierarchical heterogeneity across cortical areas, in line with model predictions. We also performed the same PCA procedure on the PSDs of the heterogeneous and homogeneous models (Figures 8E\u20138G and S8). The correlation between empirical and model PC-1 topographies was significantly higher for the heterogeneous model  than for the homogeneous model  (, dependent correlation test). These results suggest that the hierarchical organization of cortical circuits may shape the large-scale organization of spectral features across a range of timescales. In this study, we proposed a biophysically based large-scale dynamical model of human cortical activity that incorporates hierarchical heterogeneity in local circuit properties. We hypothesized that the T1w/T2w map would provide a key neural axis\u00a0along which microcircuit properties and spatiotemporal dynamics would vary. This hypothesis was informed by a convergence of findings across multiple modalities linking the T1w/T2w map, microcircuit specialization, functional organization, and the organizing principle of cortical hierarchy. Incorporating hierarchical heterogeneity in local circuit properties substantially improved the model fit to BOLD rs-FC and captured the sensory-association organization of multiple fMRI features. The heterogeneous model predicted a hierarchical topography of higher-frequency spectral features, which we found to be present in MEG. Collectively, our findings suggest that heterogeneity in local circuit properties shapes the large-scale organization of neural dynamics in human cortex. The T1w/T2w map captures a number of aspects of microcircuit specialization across cortex. This structural MRI-derived contrast measure is sensitive to regional variation in multiple microstructural properties, including intracortical myelin content (, ).  found that the T1w/T2w map captures areal variation in cytoarchitecture (), cell-type distributions, and synaptic properties. The number and density of dendritic spines on pyramidal neurons, a microanatomical correlate of local synaptic excitation, increase with cortical hierarchy, as captured by the T1w/T2w map\u00a0(, , , ). This observation provides microanatomical support for our heterogeneous model\u2019s local recurrent excitatory strengths following an increasing hierarchical gradient (). Furthermore, large-scale gene expression mapping of human cortex reveals that the T1w/T2w map captures the dominant neural axis of transcriptional variation, suggesting a common hierarchical organization for functional specialization (). These findings support our use of the T1w/T2w map as a key neural axis for hierarchical microcircuit specialization. Electrophysiological studies have established that functional dynamics of cortical areas also exhibit an organization along a sensory-association hierarchy. The timescales of intrinsic fluctuations vary across hierarchical levels both in humans () and in monkeys at the single-neuron level (). Computational modeling studies have demonstrated that these differences can arise from hierarchical differences in synaptic properties, including excitatory strengths. In turn, models have shown how hierarchical differences in synaptic properties can contribute to functional specialization of areas, such as their capacity to generate robust persistent activity related to working memory computations (, ). fMRI has also revealed functional organization of human cortex along sensory-association hierarchical gradients.  found that the principal gradient of rs-FC variation across cortex separated primary sensory areas from higher-order association areas, and this gradient aligns with the topography of intracortical myelin content as measured by T1 mapping (). Compared to sensory cortex, association areas exhibit greater variation in rs-FC profiles across subjects, suggesting that cortical hierarchy plays a role in shaping single-subject specificity of FC patterns (, ). Our model provides a circuit mechanism linking hierarchical variation in microcircuit properties to functional specialization. Relationships between dMRI-derived SC and rs-FC in human cortex have been consistently shown in prior studies (, , , ) and provide the foundation for large-scale structure-function relationships. Computational studies of large-scale cortical circuits have shown that the structure-function relationship improves when neural dynamics are near the edge of instability (, ), which was also confirmed in our study. Here, we showed that heterogeneity in local microcircuit properties has a substantial effect on model FC predictions, beyond prior modeling studies. In addition to the role of SC in shaping FC, this study provides a complementary perspective that emphasizes the importance of intrinsic properties within local circuits in shaping the large-scale functional organization of human cortex. Beyond the T1w/T2w-based hierarchical heterogeneity map examined here, our model framework can be flexibly extended to include other axes of variation. Heterogeneity maps could reflect varying distributions of receptor subtypes, neuronal cell types, and neuromodulators. These maps could be derived from gene expression, positron emission tomography, or autoradiography. Large-scale models can be fit to pharmacological neuroimaging, through simulation of hypothesized parameter perturbations that follow the expression topography of affected receptors (, ). This approach can further be applied to clinical neuroimaging to fit\u00a0the heterogeneous effects of disorder-related alterations (, ). Further computational studies of areal heterogeneity can further inform the relationships among structure, function, and physiology in the human brain. An important limitation in modeling neural mechanisms underlying rs-FC is the existence of multiple, potentially confounding, non-neural contributions to noninvasive neuroimaging measures, such as head motion, respiration, and heart-rate variability (). Individual differences in non-neural measures did not explain the improvement in model-empirical FC fit by the heterogeneous model. Nevertheless, complete removal of, or control for, non-neural confounds in a given neuroimaging modality is difficult. Characterization of neural sources of rs-FC components can be provided through convergence of multiple modalities (), including invasive recordings in animal models (, ). Our heterogeneous circuit model is parsimonious, as it simulates simplified local node dynamics, comprises only cortex, and implements a single neural axis of microcircuit specialization. The model framework can be extended in multiple important directions, which will expand the range of questions it can address. More complex local node models with multiple neurobiological dynamical processes, and inclusion of subcortical structures, may be needed to capture frequency-specific features of FC and power spectra (, , , ). For instance, cortical microcircuitry exhibits hierarchical gradients in the densities of multiple classes of inhibitory interneurons (). An extended cortical microcircuit model with distinct superficial and deep layers could exhibit richer spectral features (). Such greater diversity of temporal dynamics likely cannot be resolved by fMRI but can potentially be constrained by MEG, electroencephalography (EEG), or electrocorticography (ECoG). Multimodal functional neuroimaging may play a key role in the development of biophysically based circuit models that operate across a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Another promising direction for model extension is to incorporate subcortical structures, which can be generators of distinct dynamical processes. For instance, our cortical model does not capture strong alpha-band power in occipital cortex, which is thought to originate from interactions between cortex and thalamus (). Dynamical neural models of a thalamocortical loop can capture key aspects of resting-state dynamics, such as dynamics of alpha-band activity in occipital cortex measured with EEG (). This circuit modeling framework is well suited to study how large-scale recurrent cortico-subcortical interactions shape the spatiotemporal dynamics of cortex. In conclusion, we report a large-scale neural circuit model of human cortex with hierarchical heterogeneity of local microcircuit properties across cortical areas. The model proposes a specific circuit mechanism for how microcircuit specialization shapes the large-scale functional organization of human cortical dynamics. Our findings highlight the importance of regional heterogeneity in local circuit properties and provide support for a hierarchical neural axis reflecting important structure-function relationships in the human brain.

We used resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI) of 334 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) 900-subject data release (12/08/2015) (). The magnetic resonance (MR) preprocessing relied on the surface-based multimodal intersubject registration (MSMAll) (). The analyses also involved resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) data of 89 subjects from the same HCP dataset. Cortical areas were defined according to a multimodal parcellation (MMP1.0) comprising 360 areas, 180 per hemisphere, using the 210P boundaries from . Intersubject alignment in the HCP dataset was achieved using multi-modal areal-feature-based surface registration (MSMAll) (), which provides a number of improvements over registration techniques based only on geometrical features (such as cortical folding) and reduces biases due to registration error in group-averaged datasets. Cortical parcel boundaries in this parcellation were defined using convergent data features from multiple independent magnetic resonance imaging modalities, including T1w/T2w, cortical thickness, task-based fMRI, and resting-state functional connectivity gradients. The MMP1.0 parcellation was defined using the same HCP dataset used in our present study. The preprocessing of rs-fMRI time series was done according to the HCP minimal preprocessing pipeline; for details see . BOLD time series were further denoised using ICA-FIX which yielded the signal that drove the cortical parcellation used in this study (). ICA-FIX is designed to remove spatially structured artifactual signals through application of independent component analysis (ICA), and a machine-learning algorithm applied to classify structured components into signal or artifact. Artifactual components are then regressed out of the data, yielding a de-noised signal. No further preprocessing step was performed to ensure that the time series are consistent with those that produced the parcellations as referenced in . We note that other pre-processing methods are available, but not investigated here, such as regression based on physiological measurements (). The rs-fMRI time series of each subject comprised 4 sessions each spanning 15\u00a0min recorded with repetition time (TR) 0.72 s. The rs-fMRI time series were parcellated into 360 areas (180 areas per hemisphere) using the MMP1.0 parcellation (). We removed the first 100 time points from each of the BOLD scans to mitigate any baseline offsets or signal intensity variation. We z-scored the time series of each area, then parcellated time series of each subject were concatenated to a single time series comprising 4,400 time points (52.8\u00a0min). The time series of each area was z-scored again after concatenation. The functional connectivity (FC) matrix of each subject was computed using Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient between the time series of all pairs of areas. Structural connectivity (SC) matrices were constructed using probabilistic tractography, for each of the 334 subjects, from the HCP diffusion MRI (dMRI) minimally preprocessed data (, ). Following the HCP dMRI step, the diffusion images underwent FSL\u2019s bedpostx and probtrackx2 analysis workflows for probabilistic tractography. The SC matrices were derived by seeding at the white matter-gray matter boundary interface and counting the number of streamlines that intersected 60,000 white matter-gray matter boundary locations. Fiber orientations used in tractography were derived using a parametric deconvolution approach available in FSL (, , ) (up to 3 orientations per voxel). The dense connectome was then parcellated by considering the average between pairs of areas, and the resulting SC matrices were averaged across subjects. The diagonal elements of the group-averaged SC matrix were removed and then values of the SC were normalized between 0 and 1 (i.e., the SC matrix was divided by the maximum SC weight). For use in the computational model, the SC matrix was normalized row-wise, so that the summed long-range input strengths are equalized for each node in the network, which is simulated as a cortical microcircuit. Due to row-wise normalization, the net SC in-degree does not vary across nodes in the models. The MSMAll registered and bias field-corrected maps of the ratio between T1- to T2-weighted images (T1w/T2w) were provided with the HCP dataset. In the MMP parcellation, each of the 180 areas in each hemisphere is assigned a paired homolog in the other hemisphere (). For homologous parcels between left and right hemispheres to have the same hierarchical level in the heterogenous model, the T1w/T2w maps were symmetrized by averaging the T1w/T2w map values of the homologous parcels between left and right hemispheres. We used eyes-open resting-state MEG data of 89 subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) (, ). 3 runs of 6\u00a0min each were recorded per subject with a sampling frequency of 2034.5\u00a0Hz. Preprocessing included in the HCP release performed the following steps: removal of channels and segments as determined by the HCP quality assurance standards (), bandpass (1.3\u2013150\u00a0Hz) and notch (59\u201361\u00a0Hz, 119\u2013121\u00a0Hz) filtering, and removal of non-brain components through ICA. A precomputed single shell volume conduction model was provided in this HCP release. Preprocessing followed the pipeline provided in the HCP dataset (, ), the steps of which we summarize here. Source reconstruction was performed for approximately 8,000 vertices on the cortical surface, using the software provided by HCP and custom scripts written in MATLAB and employing the FieldTrip toolbox. Sensor data were bandpass filtered from 1.3 to 55\u00a0Hz and then projected to source space by synthetic aperture magnetometry. The sensor-covariance matrix was regularized by adding a value of 75% of its mean eigenvalue to the diagonal, and the noise covariance was assumed spherical. The direction of the source dipole was determined using a non-linear search in each dipole\u2019s tangential plane to obtain the maximum signal-to-noise-ratio for the source power. After source reconstruction on the 8k-grid, source time courses were parcellated using the 360-area MSMAll atlas. Each parcel\u2019s time course was determined as the first principal component of its constituting voxels\u2019 time courses, and then z-scored. We note that the spatial resolution of source-reconstructed MEG signals is lower than that of fMRI (), which is likely to degrade the regional specificity of MEG spectral features. The power spectral density (PSD) for each parcel was computed using Welch\u2019s method with a frequency resolution of about 1\u00a0Hz. For each parcel, the PSDs were averaged across subjects and runs, and then normalized such that the integrated PSD over the range 3\u201350\u00a0Hz equals 1. Analyses were performed on these cortical relative power maps, as in prior studies (, , ). The relative power map, defined for a particular frequency or band, provides a regional topography of the relative contribution of that frequency to the region\u2019s power. However, the presence of a strong peak in the alpha-frequency range \u2014 and to a lesser degree in the beta-range \u2014 for some, but not all, parcels strongly affects the normalization factor. As a result, the information about the alpha (and beta) peak impacts the relative power maps of other frequencies through the normalization. We therefore sought to analyze relative power with these peaks removed prior to normalization. To remove alpha and beta peaks, we first fit the group-averaged PSDs with models with sums of Lorentzian distributions (). Specifically, we fit the following two models individually to each parcel\u2019s group-averaged PSD:(1)with free parameters  and(2)with free parameters . Here,(3)is a Lorentzian distribution over frequency  defined by amplitude , center frequency  and half-width . Fitting was performed using least-squares with the following constraints on the parameters: , , , , , ,  and , where the bound  is 1.5 times the maximal amplitude in the parcel\u2019s empirical power spectrum. The best fit obtained from 10 random initializations was used. We then subtracted  and  from the parcel\u2019s empirical group-averaged PSD, and then normalized it such that it sums to 1. According to both the  goodness-of-fit metric and visual inspection, the  fit provided a cleaner removal of the peaks in the PSD than the  fit, and we therefore preferred  (Figure\u00a0S8). We used network-level analyses to characterize the hierarchical organization of empirical and simulated resting-state FC measure (i.e., comparison of the variation between sensory versus association areas). Resting-state network (RSN) assignment was performed through community detection analysis on the correlation between resting-state fMRI time series of the HCP dataset (). This network assignment was selected because it was performed on the MMP1.0 parcellation and the HCP dataset used here, and because it yielded networks with sufficient granularity for comparisons between sensory and association networks. Specifically, this approach yielded 8 functional networks in cortex, which corresponded to functional networks identified elsewhere in the literature: three sensory networks (visual, auditory, and somatomotor), and five association networks (dorsal attention, ventral attention, default mode, fronto-parietal and cingulo-opercular). The sensory-association comparisons were performed by combining the values across the three sensory networks, and across the five association networks. We adapted the biophysically-based large-scale computational model proposed by . This model reduces the complexity and the number of local microcircuit parameters in a spiking neural network model using a dynamical mean field approach (). Exploiting the long time-constants of NMDA receptors, the local node model reduces from a large spiking neural network to a two-dimensional dynamical system. Each cortical area is characterized by a microcircuit comprising a system of coupled excitatory and inhibitory populations. For each cortical microcircuit node , excitatory  and inhibitory  currents are given by:(4)(5)where  and , respectively, denote the background current and synaptic gating variable for each population ,  is the global coupling parameter,  is the long-range structural connectivity strength from node  to node ,  is the effective NMDA conductance,  sets the local excitatory-to-excitatory strength,  sets the local excitatory-to-inhibitory strength, and  sets the local inhibitory-to-excitatory strength. The firing rate of each population,  is computed using the transfer function :(6)Finally, the synaptic gating variables obey:(7)(8)where  is the standard deviation of the input noise taken from a random Gaussian process  (, ). Implementing feedback inhibition control (FIC) proposed in , for each parameter set, the inhibitory-to-excitatory strengths  were adjusted to satisfy the condition  Hz. This was done by analytically solving for  to satisfy the self-consistency of (4), (5), (6), (7), (8) at the steady-state condition with  Hz, which corresponds to  and  nA:(9)where the steady-state inhibitory synaptic gating variable  was estimated numerically by solving for :(10) The synaptic activity of each cortical area is defined by the excitatory synaptic gating variable . The excitatory synaptic activity of each area was transformed to a blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal using the Balloon-Windkessel model (). The three dimensionless magnetic field strength-dependent parameter values , , and  were derived for 3T using Appendix A of ; all other hemodynamic parameter values were taken from . In the Balloon-Windkessel model, the hemodynamic response obeys the following system of equations:(11)(12)(13)(14)where  is the excitatory synaptic gating variable,  is the vasodilatory signal,  is blood inflow,  is blood volume, and  is deoxyhemoglobin content; parameters , , , , and  are the resting oxygen extraction fraction, hemodynamic transit time, rate of signal decay, rate of flow-dependent elimination, and the Grubb\u2019s exponent, respectively. The BOLD signal is then calculated as(15)where  is the resting blood volume fraction. Values for all fixed parameters in (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), (14), (15) are provided in Table 1. Correlations between the excitatory population activity of the modeled cortical microcircuits can be approximated analytically by linearizing the system near a stable fixed point , . In brief, the linearization of the model equations enables computationally efficient calculation of the synaptic FC matrix. However, in prior studies by , , this calculation was not extended to fluctuations of the BOLD signal. We extended the linearization approximation to include the hemodynamic model for the BOLD signal. The computational efficiency provided by analytical calculation of the BOLD FC matrix was required for computationally tractable fitting of model parameters to empirical BOLD FC data. The details of the derivation for the statistical moments of the synaptic equations were described previously in , . Here, we combine the equations that describe synaptic dynamics ((7), (8)) and the hemodynamic response ((11), (12), (13), (14)) to form a single dynamical system comprised of two synaptic and four hemodynamic state variables. Given the Jacobian matrix  and noise covariance matrix  of the extended system, evaluated at the system\u2019s stable fixed point, the covariance matrix \u00a0can be approximated analytically by solving the Lyapunov equation:(16)The Jacobian of the extended system is determined by the partial derivatives of the equations for synaptic dynamics (Equations 7 and\u00a08) and the hemodynamic response ((11), (12), (13), (14)). The synaptic sub-block of the full Jacobian matrix is obtained by expanding the synaptic equations (Equations 7 and 8) around the synaptic variables\u2019 stable fixed point:(17)(18)(19)(20)(21)(22)where  denotes the temporal average (i.e., the steady-state value). The remaining non-zero elements of the full Jacobian matrix  can then be obtained by computing the partial derivatives of hemodynamic equations ((11), (12), (13), (14)) with respect to the four hemodynamic variables and the excitatory synaptic gating variable, given by:(23)(24)(25)(26)(27)(28)(29)(30)(31)where  if , and  otherwise. All other partial derivatives are identically 0. From the full Jacobian , the covariance matrix of the extended system  is then estimated by solving the Lyapunov equation (Equation\u00a016). Finally, the covariance matrix of the first-order BOLD signal fluctuations is given by:(32)where  is the matrix of partial derivates of the BOLD signal (Equation\u00a015), evaluated at the fixed point. The model-estimated BOLD FC matrix can then be computed from the BOLD covariance matrix  via(33)The parameters for estimating the BOLD signal were updated based on , to match the parameters used for 3T field strength (i.e., , , ). The transformation of the synaptic signals to BOLD signals may operate in part as a low-pass filter. We observed that the analytical BOLD FC was highly correlated with the low-frequency coherence in the synaptic system. To further characterize the role of BOLD linearization on the model fit performance, we compared the analytical BOLD FC and synaptic FC. For the homogeneous model, the similarity between synaptic and BOLD FC was high . In contrast, the heterogeneous model BOLD FC exhibited lower similarity to the synaptic FC (average , worst ). Furthermore, the magnitudes of the correlations in synaptic FC were substantially lower than the correlations in BOLD FC. Therefore, simulation of hemodynamics might have substantial impact on a model\u2019s fit to empirical BOLD FC (Figure\u00a0S3). To provide a mechanistic view of the local microcircuit dynamics, we performed theoretical analysis of the model from a dynamical systems approach. We first characterized the dynamical stability and the qualitative behavior of a single model node, with no external current . For a set of local excitatory-to-excitatory and excitatory-to-inhibitory synaptic strengths ( and , respectively), the feedback inhibitory-to-excitatory strength  is set to maintain an excitatory firing rate at  Hz () (See section: Homogeneous and heterogeneous modeling paradigms). Therefore, although the phase diagram was constructed for  and , the solution of the system implicitly depends on . The stability of the model was characterized by the largest eigenvalue  of the Jacobian matrix  of the synaptic system. We denote  and  as the real and imaginary parts, respectively, of the eigenvalue with largest real part. The fixed point dynamics are stable if  and , unstable if  and , stable spiral if  and , and unstable spiral if  and . The system exhibits a pitchfork bifurcation when  and a Hopf bifurcation when . For  values between 0.001 and 5, we numerically solved the equations for  when  and  to determine critical points. The natural frequency of the system was calculated as . To illustrate optimal model parameters projected onto the phase plane, we adjusted the external input according to the total synaptic input to each area such that  where  is the global coupling parameter and  is the long-range NMDA conductance, and  is the average synaptic gating variable. To characterize modes of spatiotemporal dynamics in the fully connected models, we performed eigenvalue and eigenvector analyses on the heterogeneous and homogeneous models at the optimal solutions. We performed eigen-decomposition of the Jacobian matrix and then we ordered the eigenvalues by characteristic timescale (i.e., ). Then we studied the patterns of the corresponding eigenvectors of the system. In particular, we examined the relationship between the eigenvector of the slowest mode and the T1w/T2w-based hierarchical heterogeneity map (Figure\u00a0S6). In both modeling paradigms, all parameters were kept constant except local excitatory-to-excitatory synaptic strength , excitatory-to-inhibitory synaptic strength , and global coupling parameter . In the homogeneous model, the values of recurrent excitatory synaptic strength  and excitatory-to-inhibitory synaptic strength  were assigned globally; i.e., the same value for each area. In the heterogeneous model,  and  were defined by a map based on the hierarchical level of each area. We showed that the T1w/T2w map is characterized by high values in sensory regions and low values in association regions (Figure\u00a01). In the heterogeneous model, we introduced hierarchical heterogeneity using the median T1w/T2w map values computed across 334 subjects. The raw T1w/T2w map values across brain areas exhibit a positively skewed distribution (). For model parameterization, we transformed the raw T1w/T2w map values into hierarchical heterogeneity map values which are more uniformly distributed, rescaled between 0 and 1, and inverted such that high- (low-) T1w/T2w areas have low (high) hierarchical heterogeneity map values (Figure\u00a0S2). Specifically, hierarchical heterogeneity map value , for each , was determined by:(34) is calculated from the raw T1w/T2w value  using the error function : . Local microcircuit parameters  and  were linearly scaled by  map values:(35)(36)where the subscript  denotes the minimum parameter value and the subscript \u201c\u201d denotes the scaling factor that defines the steepness of the hierarchical heterogeneity map. We note that the above procedure for setting local parameters as a function of the T1w/T2w values is only one possible implementation. In particular, monotonic but nonlinear transformations could provide higher-order dependencies, but these were not investigated in this study. Because the sensory\u2013association distinction is a prominent feature of the T1w/T2w map, we tested an alternative heterogeneity map reflecting only the binary categorization of areas into sensory versus association networks. Specifically, we fit the model using a heterogeneity map parameterized such that  and  strengths can each take only two values, one within sensory networks (visual, somatomotor, auditory) and another within association networks. The resulting map is assigned a value of 0 for all areas assigned to sensory networks, and a value of 1 for other areas. We used white-matter/gray-matter seeding for diffusion tractography, as this improves agreement of within-hemisphere connectivity with tracer-measured connection strengths (). We focused on modeling and analyzing within each hemisphere, i.e., not including inter-hemispheric connections, for multiple reasons. First, this focus prioritized fitting the network structure of FC, rather than inter-hemispheric FC of homologous areas. Second, dMRI tractography may have relatively poorer performance at mapping callosal connections. Consistent with this consideration, the correlation between SC and FC in the HCP dataset is higher for intra-hemispheric connections (Figure\u00a0S1). Third, this focus selection increased computational efficiency of model fitting, as on our high-performance computing cluster, the runtime of a single execution of the model was approximately 1\u00a0s for the intra-hemispheric model (180 regions), whereas it exceeded 10\u00a0s for the entire cortex (360 regions). For these reasons, we excluded inter-hemispheric connections and simulated the left and right hemisphere models separately. In both homogeneous and heterogeneous paradigms, the models comprised two intra-hemispheric compartments in which the local microcircuit parameters in homologous areas are identical but the two hemispheres do not interact. We estimated the optimal model parameters for homogeneous and heterogeneous models. The homogeneous model included four free parameters: , , and , and . The heterogeneous model parameters included six free parameters: , , , , and , and . Bayesian statistics has substantial advantages over point estimates of model parameters because it provides a better description by estimating the full posterior probability distributions of the model parameters. However, estimation of the model FC is based on a stochastic dynamical system. Therefore, it is not possible to analytically solve for the likelihood function. For this reason, we used Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), which approximates the likelihood function by minimizing a distance measure, to estimate the optimal model parameters. To find the model parameters that minimize the distance between empirical FC  and model FC , we used adaptive hierarchical Population Monte Carlo (hPMC) (, ). Since the variations across subjects are removed in average FC, we defined the distance measure based on individual FCs. Specifically, we estimated parameters which minimized the average empirical to model FC distance across the entire population () (Figures S2 and S4). In the initial step, each parameter value was drawn from its prior distribution (Table 2). In subsequent steps, the parameters were drawn from a proposal distribution. The prior distributions were informed by the phase-diagram (Figures 6 and S6). U(MIN, MAX) denotes a uniform probability distribution between the minimum (MIN) and maximum (MAX). In the PMC approach, a particle is defined as a set of model parameters that is drawn from the proposal distribution. For each particle, the model FC  was calculated according to Equation\u00a032, if the system of equations is dynamically stable. Then, we calculated the distance  as:(37)where  is the Pearson correlation coefficient,  is the number of subjects, and  denotes the average FC across regions. The first term in the parentheses of Equation\u00a037 quantifies the average Pearson distance between the model FC and subject FCs. The second term is an additional cost term quantifying the difference between mean FCs (since Pearson correlations involve mean-subtraction), ensuring that the mean model FCs do not diverge from the mean empirical FCs. The particles were rejected if the distance, , was larger than the rejection threshold . Initially, the rejection threshold was defined as the Pearson correlation distance between the empirical FC and SC. In subsequent iterations, the rejection threshold was iteratively adjusted according to the first quantile of accepted distances in the previous iteration. The algorithm was run until the number of accepted particles exceeded the minimum sample size . For the rest of the iterations , samples were drawn from the proposal distribution:(38)where the importance weight  for an accepted particle  is(39)and the random walk kernel  is defined as:(40)where  is standardized (multivariate) normal density and  is the scaling factor, which is calculated as twice the weighted empirical covariance: . In both homogeneous and heterogeneous models, the minimum sample size was set to  and the maximum number of iterations was set to . The algorithm was terminated if it reached either the maximum number of iterations or the acceptance rate (i.e., ) was lower than , indicating convergence. The homogeneous model converged after 74 iterations and the heterogeneous model converged after 84 iterations due to low acceptance rate, but the distance between empirical and model FC stabilized after approximately 50 iterations (Figure\u00a0S4). To test that the improved fitting in the heterogeneous model is not due to overfitting with the higher number of degrees of freedom in the model, we performed leave-p-out cross-validation. We repeated the optimization procedure for both homogeneous and heterogeneous models (using left cortical hemisphere, minimum sample size , maximum number of iterations ) on 267 of 334 subjects, after holding out 20% of the subjects randomly (non-overlapping subjects). Then, we calculated the model fit on the held-out test subjects. In addition to leave-p-out cross-validation, we compared the T1w/T2w-based hierarchical heterogeneity map against surrogate maps with spatial autocorrelation structure matched to the hierarchical heterogeneity map, as described in the following section (Figure\u00a02). We repeated the procedure for 500 surrogate heterogeneity maps. For computational efficiency, we ran the optimization for left cortical hemisphere, with a minimum of 500 particles for at most 50 iterations. We also performed this fitting procedure for T1w/T2w map-derived hierarchical heterogeneity maps under the same conditions. The best fit for re-optimized T1w/T2w-based hierarchical heterogeneity maps was the same as that for the main optimization of the heterogeneous model (i.e., left-right concatenated). For all maps, we ensured that the similarity between empirical and model FC stabilized within 50 maximum iterations (Figure\u00a0S4). To assess how well the optimization procedure can identify known parameter values, we generated 334 model FC matrices (i.e., the number of subjects) from the approximated posterior distribution. We then performed the optimization procedure using these FC matrices. We also repeated this procedure after adding an observation noise with  (approximately matching the noise level in the empirical data). Finally, we calculated the errors in estimated model parameters with respect to the original model parameters. Both with and without observation noise, the model recovered the parameter values with low error. We assessed an alternative parametrization of the model \u2014 i.e., which parameters vary along the heterogeneity map \u2014 which does not depend on synaptic weights: the time constants of the excitatory and inhibitory populations,  and , respectively. Here, we multiplied the parameters  and  by a factor  and . The time constants decrease if , and increase if . To ensure that the fixed-point solution of the system does not change, thereby isolating changes in timescales, we updated the equations such that:(41)(42)The posterior distributions for the parameters were defined as  for  and  for  parameters. The rest of the parameters and optimization procedure were the same as the standard parameterization of synaptic strengths. Below, we describe two simple non-neural models of simulated BOLD dynamics: the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process model, and the simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) model, the latter of which is the discrete time counterpart to the former. Fitting these more phenomenological models can test whether hierarchical heterogeneity of local properties improves the fit to empirical FC patterns, with generality across a broader set of dynamical models. We generalize these models by introducing hierarchical heterogeneity of self-coupling strengths, denoted  for node , which vary across nodes parametrically by the heterogeneity map values according to:(43)The heterogeneity parameters  and  were included in the set of fit parameters for each model. We simulated BOLD activity directly with a coupled OU-process model which, when written as a Langevin equation, has the standard functional form, for the activity  of node :(44)where  sets the strength of noise inputs and  is independent Gaussian white noise. For the coupling matrix A, we use the structural connectivity matrix C scaled by a scalar-valued global coupling parameter :(45)The expression in brackets in Equation\u00a045 above defines the system\u2019s Jacobian matrix, i.e.,(46)The noise terms, , are assumed to be independent and normally distributed inputs with zero mean and equal variance, as in the dynamic mean-field model, resulting in a noise covariance matrix . Thus, we can solve for the covariance matrix of the OU-process model analytically using the Lyapunov equation:(47) We simulated BOLD activity directly with a simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) process model. In general, SAR-process models can be written with the temporally discretized functional form(48)where W is a weight matrix describing the influence of activity at time  on the activity at time ,  is a coupling constant which scales the strength of this autoregressive process, and  is white noise (i.e., serial autocorrelation-free samples with zero mean and finite variance). In general, autoregressive processes are the discrete time analogs of OU processes. We introduced hierarchical heterogeneity with the addition of a hierarchically varying self-coupling term:(49)where  sets the strength of the self-coupling in area  parametrized according to Equation\u00a043, C corresponds to the structural connectivity matrix, and  sets the standard deviation of the Gaussian noise, i.e., . To obtain analytic expressions for the covariance matrices, we multiply both sides of Equation 49 by their transposes and apply the temporal averaging operator, . In the steady-state condition,(50)from which it follows that(51)where w is a diagonal matrix. We fit both OU and SAR models to the empirical BOLD FC using a grid-search algorithm. 20 samples for each parameter (8000 parameter sets in total) were executed from uniform distributions: for OU, ; for SAR, . The model fit at the optimal solution was  for OU, and  for SAR. An alternative parametrization of SAR, based on hierarchical heterogeneity of , produced the same fit value, and therefore was not included here. First we characterized the spatial autocorrelation structure of median empirical cortical T1w/T2w maps using a spatial lag model. We fit the data using a spatial lag model of the form , where  is a vector of first Box-Cox transformed and then mean-subtracted map values. The Box-Cox transformation was first applied to the maps so their values were approximately normally distributed.  is the normalized weight matrix with zero diagonal and off-diagonal elements proportional to , where  is the surface-based geodesic distance between cortical areas  and , and  is a normalization factor. Weights  define the fraction of spatial influence on area  attributable to area . To calculate geodesic distances, we used the 32k-vertex midthickness surface mesh in the HCP atlas. Two free parameters  and  are estimated by minimizing the residual sum-of-squares (). Using best-fit parameter values  and , surrogate maps  are generated according to , where . For the Box-Cox normalized T1w/T2w values, this fit yielded  mm, and . To match distributions of surrogate map values to the distribution of values in the corresponding empirical map (e.g., the T1w/T2w map), rank-ordered surrogate map values were re-assigned the corresponding rank-ordered values in the empirical map. Note that this approach to surrogate data generation approximates a spatial autocorrelation-preserving permutation test of the empirical neuroimaging map. Using these surrogate maps, we constructed null distributions for  models and report significance values as the proportion of samples in the null distributions whose model fit value is greater than or equal to that obtain from the model using the T1w/T2w-based hierarchical heterogeneity map. We used regression analysis, performed across subjects, to test whether the improved rs-FC fit of the heterogeneous model, relative to the homogeneous model, may be driven by fitting of FC components attributable to non-neural confounding factors such as head motion, heart rate variations, and respiration (). The movement parameters and physiological logs were provided in the HCP dataset. The head motion of each subject was calculated as the mean absolute movement and mean relative movement. Heart rate and respiration variations were calculated as the total variance of each variable across sessions. To test whether the relationship between movement parameters and model fit can explain the improved performance of the heterogeneous model, we constructed a linear regression model :(52)Each subject yields a data point in , defined as the difference in model fit for the heterogeneous model compared to the homogeneous model (i.e., ).  denotes the z-score of four subject-specific non-neural confounding factors  in the set of four denoted : mean absolute head movement, mean relative head movement, heart rate variance, and respiration variance. We compared the full regression model  above to a reduced model that corresponds to the difference in model fit being independent of confounds: . Through comparison of the full and reduced regression models, we examined the contribution of the non-neuronal confounding factors on the improved model fit in the heterogeneous model. We compared the fraction of variance in the data which is captured by the model, calculating the ratio of explained variance for the full versus reduced regression models, which we found to be very small. To study the differences between the performance of the homogeneous and heterogeneous models, we quantified the model\u00a0fitting\u00a0for the FCs within and across 8 canonical resting state networks (RSNs). The within-network fit for network  was calculated\u00a0as:(53)where ,  is a vector comprising the mean functional connectivity values between regions  and , and  denotes the Pearson correlation coefficient between variables  and . Similarly, the across-network fit for network  is defined as:(54) We tested whether hierarchical heterogeneity can also explain rs-FC measures which exhibit a hierarchical preference. One such measure is global brain connectivity (GBC) (). Here, we adapted GBC to parcellated rs-FC matrices. The GBC of region  was defined as the average FC between region  and the rest of the regions:(55)where  is the number of brain regions. GBC is equivalent to the graph-theoretic measure of node strength normalized by total number of nodes. To provide mechanistic insight into the model-generated GBC, we compared the patterns of model GBC to the SC node degree (), and to the eigenvector of the slowest mode. We calculated the SC node degree as the sum of non-zero connections of each brain area, after binarizing the SC matrix using a threshold ( for the normalized SC matrix) (Figure\u00a0S6). To characterize variation in rs-FC patterns of each region across subjects, we adapted inter-individual variability as proposed in . Since this measure reflects the dissimilarity across rs-FC patterns, we refer to it as a measure of dissimilarity instead of variability. In empirical data, we refer to the measure as inter-individual dissimilarity, whereas in the model, we refer to it as inter-particle dissimilarity. The inter-individual/particle dissimilarity  is calculated as:(56)where  is a vector of rs-FC values between region  and rest of the regions in subject/particle ,  is the Spearman rank-correlation between variables  and , and  denotes expected value. Due to the analytical approximation of the model FCs, the scales of inter-individual and inter-particle dissimilarity were different. To normalize the scales of both measures, we z-scored the\u00a0final spatial maps of inter-individual/particle dissimilarity. Of note, cross-subject alignment in MMSAll registration is limited by atypical topologies, and therefore some portion of inter-individual dissimilarity is attributable to mis-registration of areas to the atlas (). In addition to inter-individual dissimilarity, we characterized the standard deviations of each connection in empirical and model FC, calculated across subjects for empirical and across particles for model. Then, we calculated the similarities between the empirical and model standard deviation FC matrices. As described in , the power spectrum of the model can be analytically approximated around its fixed points. The cross-spectrum  as a function of frequency  can be calculated by:(57)where  is the Jacobian of the system of synaptic variables described by (4), (5), (6), (7), (8),  is the standard deviation of the input noise,  is , and  is the identity matrix. The power spectral density (PSD) was computed as the diagonal elements of  for frequencies  (0.01, \u2026, 75\u00a0Hz). The PSDs of left and right hemisphere models were normalized by dividing by total PSD. The PSDs were reported in dB . To study the role of long-range connections on the behavior of the system, we estimated the PSDs of the model without long-range connections (Figure\u00a0S7). Briefly, we replaced the term  in Equation\u00a04 with a constant current set to the average excitatory synaptic gating variable , such that the long-range connection term reduced to an external synaptic input, i.e., . We applied principal component analysis (PCA) to the group-averaged MEG PSDs across cortical areas (, , ) (Figures 7 and S8). The PSDs were log-transformed so that the data are in units of dB. Prior to PCA, the PSDs were normalized across areas by parcel-averaged spectral power of each frequency, so that they expressed fractional deviation from the mean. Then PCA was applied to this data matrix  whose axes are parcel by frequency (size: 360 samples  48 features). PCA yielded principal axes (as eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix) in the frequency feature\u00a0space. Principal axis 1 is therefore the spectral pattern which captures the most spectral variance across areas. We define\u00a0the principal components (PCs) as the coordinates of the data expressed in the basis of corresponding principal axes. PC-1 is therefore the areal map whose values are the loadings of spectral variation for each area onto principal axis 1. PC-1 maps were compared to the T1w/T2w map. For both homogeneous and heterogeneous models, we used the same data analysis procedure to extract the first principal components, in the same frequency range as the empirical data (3\u201350\u00a0Hz). We repeated the same analysis using raw (i.e., without alpha/beta components removed) MEG PSD relative power maps, and after removal of alpha, or alpha and beta, Lorentzians (Figure\u00a0S8). We also performed PCA over the model PSDs in a broader frequency range (0\u201375\u00a0Hz) (Figure\u00a0S8). To show the validity of the analytical approximation of BOLD FC and PSD, we employed full simulations of the model. We integrated synaptic (4), (5), (6), (7), (8) and BOLD (11), (12), (13), (14) using Euler method with  ms. The input noise levels were defined as . This input noise level was chosen to avoid noise-induced destabilization of the system as it approaches a bifurcation. To calculate BOLD FC, we simulated the BOLD signals for 870\u00a0s to match experimental recording sessions. The first 6\u00a0s of simulations were discarded to ensure that the system\u2019s state converges to the neighborhood of the baseline fixed point. The simulated BOLD signals were down-sampled using 0.72\u00a0s resolution resulting in 1200 TRs as in the single\u2013session empirical BOLD data from the HCP. To calculate simulated PSDs, we simulated the excitatory synaptic gating variables for 170 s, and later downsampled to  ms after removing the first 6\u00a0s of simulations. In total, 10 simulations were performed for 20 random iterations using particles that were drawn from the posterior distribution. To assess the role of noise in numerical simulations we concatenated the simulated time series (after z-scoring across time points), and calculated the simulated BOLD FC for different scan times. The similarity between simulated and analytical BOLD FC rose to  for the simulations with  TR ( h; matching the duration of 4 sessions of empirical BOLD time series in HCP data). The same simulation protocol was repeated using synaptic delays. The distance between brain regions was defined by the average pairwise Euclidean distance between two parcels. The conductance velocity was defined as  m/s, which is consistent with empirically observed values (). As a statistical test for the difference between similarities of the measures derived from homogeneous and heterogeneous models to\u00a0the empirical data, we employed the dependent correlation test. The dependent correlations test provides a non-parametric test to compare the correlations of two variables against a common dependent variable based on bootstrapping (). The dependent correlation tests were employed directly when Spearman rank correlation was used as a measure of similarity (i.e., GBC and BLP). When Pearson correlation was used as a measure of similarity (i.e., FC, within-/across-network FC, inter-individual/particle dissimilarity), skipped Pearson correlation was used to perform dependent correlation tests due to sensitivity of Pearson correlation to possible outliers during bootstrapping. However, using Pearson correlation instead of skipped Pearson correlation did not change the results. To assess the improvement in explanatory power of each model with respect to SC alone, we constructed a linear regression model to predict empirical FC such that :(58)We compared the variation explained by the full model to the reduced model, in which the empirical FC is predicted by only SC :(59)We calculated the coefficient of partial determination (CPD) as:(60)The CPD is the proportion of variation that cannot be explained by the reduced model, but can be explained by the full model. To test for differences between the average measures in sensory and association areas in empirical data (i.e., T1w/T2w maps, GBC, inter-individual dissimilarity), we used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test provides a non-parametric measure for the difference between the ranks of repeated measurements of two related samples. The surrogate heterogeneity maps were used to generate various sample null distributions for statistics (e.g., model FC fitting). Reported significance values were calculated as the proportion of samples in the null distributions whose values exceeded that of the test statistic.

We propose that encoding of behavioral features is not constrained by retinotopic borders and instead varies smoothly over space within association regions. During visually guided navigation, sensory information is processed and transformed into motor plans to achieve rewarding outcomes. This processing involves the dorsal posterior part of cortex, which includes visual, parietal, and retrosplenial areas. These areas represent visual stimuli (), combine visual and locomotion information for predictive coding (, ), transform sensory cues into motor plans (, , , ), and maintain navigation-related signals such as heading direction and route progression (, ). Despite progress in understanding these processes in individual areas, a high-resolution\u00a0spatial map of navigation-related features across the posterior cortex has not been established. Here, we investigated how the representations that support visually guided navigation are distributed and combined across cortical space. To what degree\u00a0is information localized or distributed? How do representations relate to known area boundaries? Where are visual and\u00a0movement information combined to inform task-relevant behaviors? Pioneering studies have mapped and segmented the mouse posterior cortex using anatomical features and retinotopy. Tract tracing studies have identified a number of visual areas (V1, PM, AM, AL, LM) (, ). These areas represent retinotopic copies of the visual space, and functional boundaries between them can be defined based on reversal of the visual field sign (, ). Although retinotopic copies suggest discrete areas, anatomical studies using cyto- and chemoarchitecture have, in some cases, identified transitions shifted relative to retinotopic boundaries (), or have found smooth anatomical gradients at sharp retinotopic borders (, ). Also, the organization within parietal and retrosplenial areas has been challenging to identify because these areas are not well driven by simple visual stimuli () and lack internal anatomical boundaries (). It is therefore not fully understood how the organization of the posterior cortex may impact the encoding of behavioral variables and the emergence of multimodal representations for navigation. In particular, it is unclear whether the posterior cortex, especially higher association regions, encodes behavioral information in functionally discrete areas, as suggested by retinotopic mapping. Alternatively, secondary and higher regions could form a smooth continuum of functional properties, as suggested by anatomical studies. Much work on the function of secondary visual areas has emphasized the differences between their responses to simple visual stimuli such as drifting gratings (, , , ). However, some of these studies also provided evidence that nearby regions of cortex tend to be functionally more similar than distant ones (, ). This is consistent with recent work that has revealed that areas in the mouse posterior cortex are highly interconnected. Retrograde tracing has found nearly all-to-all inter-area connectivity (). Also, most V1 neurons broadcast information to multiple areas via branching axon collaterals (). Theoretical models have proposed that these connectivity patterns are consistent with an organization in which the probability of connectivity between cortical locations decays smoothly with distance, such that similarity in\u00a0encoding decreases gradually over space (). A smooth functional organization could explain apparent discrepancies in area boundaries and suggest spatial proximity\u00a0as a simple principle for the emergence of multimodal representations. Here, we mapped behavior-related cortical activity in mice during a visually guided navigation task using dense sampling with single-neuron resolution. We developed analyses to relate neural activity to behavior and cortical space in an unbiased manner. Representations of individual task-related features were highly distributed across the posterior cortex, with each area encoding most features of the task, consistent with reports in anterior brain regions (, , ). Except for sharp transitions between primary visual, parietal, and retrosplenial areas, representations were spatially organized as gradients of encoding similarity. As a result, despite the lack of sharp boundaries, the posterior cortex could be divided into discriminable areas based on quantitative differences in the encoding of task features. Multimodal sensory-motor representations emerged where gradients for the encoding of optic flow and locomotion overlapped, specifically near posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Our results add a map of encoding of task-related information to existing maps based on anatomical or simple functional properties and improve our understanding of distinctions and divisions between association areas. We developed a task for mice with the goal to engage the visual and navigation-related networks in the dorsal posterior cortex. Mice interacted with a visual virtual reality environment comprising dots displayed on a screen at randomized locations in 3D space (STAR Methods; Figure\u00a01A; Video S1). The running velocity of the mouse on a spherical treadmill (ball), measured as the pitch and roll velocity of the ball, controlled linear and\u00a0angular movement in the virtual environment (). Mice were trained to run approximately two meters straight forward, in virtual world coordinates, from an invisible reference point to obtain a reward. The reference point was reset to the current position of the mouse after a reward or if the mouse did not maintain a straight path (STAR Methods; Figures 1B and 1C). A random offset (drift) velocity was added to the linear and angular movement of the dots on the screen and changed every 6\u201312 s, independently of reward times. To obtain rewards, mice therefore continuously needed to adjust their running to compensate for the drift and run straight in the virtual world. This task required training, and mice reached steady-state performance after about 2\u00a0weeks (Figures 1D\u20131F). In addition, we periodically switched to open-loop playback of a visual stimulus that was identical to a visual stimulus previously generated by the mouse\u2019s behavior (Figure\u00a01C). During open-loop segments, as expected, the instantaneous correlation between the angular ball and screen velocities was low. However, there was a strong cross-correlation, with the ball velocity lagging the screen velocity by about 360\u00a0ms (Figure\u00a01G). Mice thus remained engaged and attempted to correct angular motion even during the open-loop playback. A key feature of this task was the use of virtual reality to decorrelate optic flow and locomotion using drift and open-loop periods (, , ). The same locomotor actions resulted in distinct optic flow patterns and vice versa. This made it possible to dissociate neural encoding of visual signals, locomotion signals, and visual-motor interactions. To test whether activity in the dorsal posterior cortex had a causal relationship with the behavior required for the task, we inhibited small volumes of cortex by optogenetically activating GABAergic interneurons (, ). We first tested the effect of inhibition on locomotion by setting the drift velocity to zero, thus fixing visual-motor relationships (Figure\u00a01H). We mapped inhibition across a grid on each hemisphere. Cortical inhibition affected both forward and angular running velocity. Forward velocity was reduced when inhibiting either V1 or posterior motor cortex bilaterally (Figure\u00a01I, left). Unilateral\u00a0inactivation of medial V1 and PM caused an ipsiversive increase in angular velocity (Figure\u00a01I, right). This effect was consistent with a blinding in the contralateral visual hemifield. Such blinding would create a net ipsiversive optic flow during forward running and an expected compensatory ipsiversive locomotor shift. We also tested the effect of cortical inhibition in the full task, which included velocity drift, to understand whether cortical regions were required to adapt to changing visual-motor mappings (Figure\u00a01J). Around the times of drift switches, we inhibited four locations individually that showed different effects in the no-drift case: central V1, medial V1/PM, PPC, and retrosplenial cortex (RSP) (Figure\u00a01K, left). As expected from the no-drift experiments, both unilateral and bilateral inhibition of V1 or PM reduced the reward rate. Also, although inhibition of either PPC or RSP had little effect on locomotion in the absence of drift, inhibition of these areas decreased the reward rate in the presence of drift (Figures 1I and 1K, right). Unilateral inhibition had a stronger effect than bilateral inhibition for V1 and PM, whereas bilateral effects were stronger for PPC and RSP. Together with the no-drift experiments and prior work on PPC and RSP (, ), these findings suggest that, in our task, V1/PM activity might be compared across hemispheres to determine locomotion direction and that PPC and RSP might be involved in adjusting behavior for changing sensorimotor mappings. While mice performed the task, we imaged the activity of cortical neurons (either layer 2/3 or layer 5) in transgenic mice that expressed GCaMP6s in a subset of excitatory neurons (). In each session, we imaged a 650- by 650-\u03bcm field of view (Figure\u00a02A). Over multiple sessions, we systematically tiled fields of view to cover the dorsal posterior cortex, including areas identified in the Allen Institute Mouse Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) v.3: V1 (VisP), secondary visual areas (AL, AM, PM), parietal areas (RL, A), retrosplenial areas (RSPagl-MM, RSPd), and trunk somatosensory cortex (SSPd-tr) () (Figures 2B\u20132D). The posterior cortex was sampled without regard to anatomical boundaries to allow an unbiased analysis of activity distributions\u00a0across cortical space. Also, we sampled densely at single-neuron resolution to uncover functionally distinct, but spatially overlapping, single-neuron properties and potential heterogeneities that might be obscured with spatial averaging, such as with wide-field imaging. We identified time-varying fluorescence sources automatically () and then deconvolved the fluorescence traces () (STAR Methods; Figures S1H\u2013S1M). We included putative apical dendrites (Figure\u00a0S1K), which have been shown to follow the activity of L5 somata (). Our dataset comprised 18,127 somata (layer 2/3: 14,377; layer 5: 3,750) and 5,086 putative apical dendrites (Figure\u00a02E). We refer to both somata and putative apical dendrites as \u201cneurons.\u201d In each mouse, under the same imaging window, we also mapped retinotopy with wide-field calcium imaging. Visual field sign maps were aligned to the two-photon data using blood vessels (Figures S1A\u2013S1D). Each mouse was registered to the Allen Institute CCF by aligning the field sign map to a CCF-aligned reference field sign map (http://portal.brain-map.org/) (Figures 2C, 2D, and S1E). This registration identified the position of each neuron within the CCF. We estimated the error of our alignment procedure using Allen Institute field sign maps that contained ground-truth CCF coordinates. Our procedure resulted in errors less than 130\u00a0\u03bcm (Figures 2C, S1E, and S1F), which was smaller than the smallest posterior brain regions and less than the length scales for most of our analyses (see STAR Methods for details on alignment). We wanted to understand how the relationship between neural activity and task information varied across cortical space. To relate neural activity to behavior, we considered common approaches to model a neuron\u2019s activity as a function of measured task variables (, , ). In these approaches, the experimenter defines and evaluates a small set of potential relationships between neural activity and task features. A benefit of these approaches is that they allow the experimenter to focus on specific encoding relationships. However, our aim was to compare encoding across diverse cortical regions. We therefore considered it important to use an approach that did not rely on strong prior assumptions about the relationships between neural activity and task features. For example, in parietal and retrosplenial areas, there is little agreed-upon expectation for these relationships. Because these regions are far removed from the sensory periphery, encoding could include complex temporal patterns and nonlinear transformations of task variables. Further, to reveal the organization of encoding across cortical space, we considered it initially not critical\u00a0to understand which aspects of the task were encoded in particular regions; this question is considered later. We initially asked how, rather than which, encoding properties changed across cortex. We built an automated feature extractor that identified neural-activity-relevant features of task variables in a way that required minimal assumptions about encoding relationships (Figure\u00a02F). The task feature extractor took the form of a convolutional neural network (CNN) that received as input 4-s-long temporal snippets of each measured task variable. The convolutions were applied in the temporal dimension. The input task variables were the linear and angular locomotion (ball) velocity, the linear and angular optic flow (screen) velocity, the time since the last drift switch, the times since the last open-loop onset and offset, the time since the last reward, and rotation of the ball in yaw (yaw was not used to control the virtual environment). The feature extractor was trained to reduce the input snippet to a set of 64 \u201ctask factors\u201d that optimally describe neural activity. Each task factor was not constrained to represent an individual task variable and could represent a nonlinear combination of task variables, including complex temporal dependencies. The task factors were then used as the predictors in a regression model (Poisson-distributed generalized linear model, GLM) to explain the activity of each neuron (a linear visual receptive field estimate was added as an additional predictor, see STAR Methods). The task factors were shared across and optimized for all neurons, but separate GLM weights were fit for each neuron. The GLMs predicted the deconvolved fluorescence activity of the given neuron at a time point 3\u00a0s into the 4-s input snippet. A neuron\u2019s encoding could thus be described by its set of GLM weights across the task factors. Importantly, the CNN and the GLMs were trained jointly on the entire dataset. Therefore, the predictors in our model were identified by the CNN based on an objective optimization procedure, rather than being manually specified. Each task factor corresponded to some aspect of the task that was relevant for neural activity. We chose 64 task factors because this number maximized the prediction quality on held-out data. We designed the model to ensure that each factor represented a different aspect of the task (STAR Methods). Consequently, correlations between factors were low (Figure\u00a0S1N), and factors were not well described by a lower-dimensional linear subspace (Figure\u00a0S1O). Our model captured a substantial amount of the neural activity variance (mean fraction of Poisson deviance explained: 0.147, Figure\u00a02G). 78.1% of activity sources had fit qualities that were significantly higher than chance (false discovery rate of 0.001 []). Several versions of more traditional GLMs performed worse (e.g., Figure\u00a0S8B). We created encoding maps for each of the 64 task factors obtained from our model. In these maps, at each neuron\u2019s anatomical location, we plotted that neuron\u2019s weight for the given factor. The map for a given factor showed the spatial distribution of a factor\u2019s weights and thus the importance across space of a particular aspect of the task for neural activity. We smoothed the maps using a Gaussian kernel chosen with cross-validation to give the best prediction performance across mice (Figure\u00a02I). The encoding of most task factors (63 of 64 factors) had structure across cortical space, indicating that task features were not uniformly represented across all areas (Figure\u00a02J). This initial visualization indicated that we were able to capture functional relationships between cortical areas based solely on task-related neural activity. We note that the identity of the individual factors shown in Figure\u00a02J depended on the initialization of the CNN (STAR Methods, section Factor non-identifiability controls). However, the high dimensional encoding structure described by all factors collectively was unaffected by the initialization (Figure\u00a0S2). We used this high dimensional structure for all analyses. To analyze how the encoding of task features changed across cortical space, we examined the average spatial rate of change of the encoding maps (Figure\u00a03A). The rate-of-change map showed sharp transitions in the encoding properties that divided the analyzed region into three areas: V1, RSP, and a secondary visual-parietal area. These boundaries did not align precisely with the retinotopic field sign borders and were better aligned with the boundaries defined by the Allen Institute, which are based on cyto- and chemoarchitecture (Figures 3A and S3) (). In particular, the peak rate of change in encoding at the lateral side of V1 was displaced laterally from the visual field sign border (Figures 3A and S3A\u2013S3D) (). Further, the rate of change of encoding did not reveal sharp transitions within the secondary visual-parietal area. For example, the anterior boundary of AM in the field sign map did not correspond to a peak in the rate of change of encoding properties of neurons (Figure\u00a0S3E and S3F). To test whether the three main divisions contained sub-regions\u00a0with different encoding properties, we grouped regions based on encoding similarity by applying k-means clustering to the encoding maps (Figure\u00a03B). The fraction of variance explained increased smoothly with the number of clusters and was more similar to simulations of smooth maps than to simulations of clustered maps (Figure\u00a03C). This suggested that there was no optimal number of clusters beyond the three main divisions and that clustering likely subdivided a continuum. However, despite the lack of sharp boundaries, sub-regions within the three main divisions were statistically discriminable based on their encoding properties. To show this, we grouped neurons into encoding types based on their weights for task factors. Each spatial cluster (\u201careas\u201d in Figure\u00a03B) could then be characterized by the distribution of encoding types it contained. We trained a naive Bayes classifier on this distribution from four mice and, in a fifth mouse, predicted the area identities based on the encoding type distributions (Figure\u00a03D). For up to seven areas, each area in a map was discriminable from each other area. Even for 15 areas, only two confusions occurred (Figure\u00a03E). This discriminability suggested that encoding properties varied consistently across mice within the three main areas apparent in the map of the rate of change of encoding (Figure\u00a03A). The order in which subdivisions emerged at increasingly finer map resolutions provided insights into the functional relationships between areas (Figure\u00a03B). To highlight these relationships, we performed hierarchical clustering on the encoding maps (Figure\u00a03F), and we overlaid the areas identified from clustering with the areas defined by the Allen Institute (Figure\u00a0S4). Multiple interesting observations emerged from the k-means and hierarchical clustering. First, parietal regions clustered with medial secondary visual areas. Parietal regions could be subdivided into: a medial strip including area A, part of area AM, and area PM; a lateral region overlapping with RL; and, an anterior region close to somatosensory cortex. Second, RSP could be divided into separate clusters along the anterior-posterior axis, indicating that it may not be a functionally uniform region (see left branch of clustering hierarchy in Figure\u00a03F). Third, AL was functionally more similar to the AM-MM clusters than to RL, which was consistent with connectivity () but differed from tuning preferences for simple visual stimuli (). Fourth, even at fine clustering resolution (15 clusters), we did not observe a cluster aligned with the retinotopically defined part of area AM. Finally, the most consistent boundaries in all maps were at the divisions between primary visual, parietal, and retrosplenial areas, but the boundaries within these main divisions differed substantially across maps. Cortical areas were therefore statistically discriminable based on their functional relationship with task features at a resolution comparable to anatomical and retinotopic maps. However, except for the boundaries between V1, parietal, and retrosplenial areas, encoding properties varied gradually. Given that the posterior cortex could be divided into discriminable areas, we wanted to understand the underlying structure of the discriminability at the resolution of single neurons. We initially hypothesized that the discriminability of cortical areas was due to a spatial compartmentalization of encoding properties across areas, such that each area would be characterized by neurons with encoding properties that were unique to that area. We analyzed how neurons in each area were distributed across the space of encoding properties. The encoding properties of a neuron were defined as the neuron\u2019s weights for the task factors. For visualization, we reduced the 64-dimensional weights into two dimensions with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) (Figure\u00a04A). For the following analyses, we used the parcellation into five areas for ease of display (Figure\u00a04B), but similar results were found with ten areas or with the areas defined by the Allen Institute (Figure\u00a0S5). If each area had unique encoding properties, neurons in encoding space would segregate by cortical area. Instead, each of the five cortical areas contained neurons in most parts of encoding space (Figure\u00a04C). We quantified these observations by analyzing the distribution of the full 64-dimensional encoding weights. The relationship between cell-cell anatomical distance and cell-cell distance in encoding space was weakly positive (Pearson correlation 0.031 over 0- to 500-\u03bcm cortical distance, p\u00a0< 10\u2212323, Figure\u00a04D). Anatomically nearby neurons had a wide range of similarity in encoding, similar to anatomically far apart neurons. Consequently, a neuron in one cortical area often had a nearest neighbor in encoding space that was located in another area, indicating that areas overlapped in their encoding properties (Figure\u00a04E). This overlap was extensive: for all areas except V1, most nearest-encoding neighbors were located in different areas. We also quantified the dispersion of the encoding weights of the neurons in an area by summing the variances of each of the 64 encoding dimensions (\u201ctotal dispersion\u201d). We then normalized each area\u2019s total dispersion by the total dispersion across all areas. If areas had specialized single-neuron encoding properties, each area was expected to have a normalized total dispersion less than one. This was the case only for V1 (Figure\u00a04F). In contrast, the area comprising parietal and secondary visual regions (PM, AM, A, MM) had a normalized total dispersion greater than one and thus tiled encoding space more evenly than the overall population (Figure\u00a04F). Therefore, each cortical region had diverse encoding properties that overlapped with those from different regions, indicating that encoding properties in our task were not spatially compartmentalized. The even tiling of encoding space by parietal and secondary visual areas indicated a diversity of encoding that was consistent with a role of these areas in the integration of information across the surrounding regions. Our results so far indicated that cortical areas were discriminable based on their encoding properties, but also that encoding properties were distributed across areas. Therefore, we considered that encoding properties could be distributed without regard to area boundaries, but non-randomly, such that areas were discriminable based on their characteristic profile of encoding properties. We tested whether distributed encoding properties were more likely than area-specific\u00a0properties to be informative about the identity of a cortical area. We identified neurons with similar encoding properties by discretizing the encoding weight space into encoding types (STAR Methods; Figure\u00a03D). An inspection of the distribution of each of the encoding types across cortical space revealed that neurons from a single encoding type were typically highly distributed and found in many regions (Figure\u00a0S6C). We quantified to what degree particular encoding types were under- or over-represented in different areas. We used the joint probability distribution of cortical areas and encoding types to compute the pointwise mutual information (PMI) between each area and encoding type (Figures 5A and 5B). The PMI measured how much the probability of observing a particular encoding type in a particular area deviated from statistical independence, that is, from a situation in which the encoding type was uninformative about the cortical area. The PMI was positive if the encoding type was enriched in the area and negative if it was selectively excluded from the area. Few encoding types were significantly specific to a single cortical area. Only 5 of 100 encoding types had a PMI significantly greater than zero for any area (Figures 5B\u20135D). Instead, neurons of the same encoding type were typically distributed across several areas. Most pairs of encoding type and area had PMI values near zero, indicating that the presence of an encoding type in a given area provided little information about the identity of the area (Figure\u00a05E, middle three panels). However, a fair number of pairs of encoding type and cortical area (64 of 500) had PMI values that were significantly less than zero (Figures 5C and 5D). Neurons of these encoding types were significantly excluded from certain areas (Figure\u00a05E, left). Consequently, these encoding types were informative about their cortical location without being specifically localized to a certain area. Similar results were obtained when using the Allen Institute-defined areas (Figure\u00a0S6A). Therefore, cortical areas were distinct because they had different relative profiles of encoding properties and not because of encoding types that were specific to individual areas. Areas were separable at the population scale but with many similarities at the level of individual neurons. For a given neuron with known encoding properties, it was difficult to identify in which area it resided (Figures 5E and S6). Similarly, for a given area, it was difficult to predict the encoding properties of a neuron chosen from that area (Figures 4C and 4E). Above, we analyzed encoding relationships using unsupervised methods to gain insights into the functional organization of cortex without relying on the interpretability of the encoded task features. Next, we considered how the encoding of explicitly measured task variables varied across cortical space. First, to visualize the large-scale involvement of cortex in the task, we considered how activity changed around the time of the reward (Figure\u00a06A). In the visual-retrosplenial regions, activity was high during ongoing behavioral actions, including fast running prior to a reward, and activity was low when the mouse stopped following a reward (Figure\u00a06A). The pattern was reversed in the parietal region. Parietal region activity was high during periods of acceleration and deceleration (Figure\u00a06A). These patterns were consistent with a role for the visual-retrosplenial\u00a0group in the maintenance of a straight locomotion trajectory. The activity in the parietal group was consistent with an involvement in the adjustment of behavior in response to task events (). We next used our encoding model (Figure\u00a02) to understand how encoding of specific task variables varied across cortex (Figures 6 and S7). For each neuron, we quantified how well the full model, with all task variables included, could explain the neuron\u2019s activity (measured as deviance explained). From the full-model deviance, we subtracted the deviance explained by a model that included all variables except the variable of interest (Figures 6B and 6D). The difference in the performance of these models provided a conservative estimate of a variable\u2019s contribution to a neuron\u2019s activity (STAR Methods). The primary variables relevant for the task were locomotion velocity (ball velocity) and movement velocity through the virtual environment (screen velocity), which were decorrelated by adding drift and open-loop periods. Encoding of these variables varied mainly along the anterior-posterior axis (Figures 6B and 6D). Screen velocity encoding was strongest in medial V1 and PM, which correspond to the temporal visual field, where optic flow is strongest during forward locomotion. In contrast, locomotion velocity encoding was strongest in a region corresponding to the Allen CCF area VisA. As expected, linear visual receptive fields were restricted to V1 (Figures 6B and 6D). In addition, we tested for the encoding of more complex features, including nonlinear combinations of task variables and task history (STAR Methods). Nonlinear interactions between task variables were encoded almost equally strongly in all areas (Figures 6B and 6D). To test for encoding of task history, we compared models that had access to either 3 or 0.3\u00a0s of past task variables. We found that task history was encoded most strongly in RSP and in the parietal areas (areas 3 and 5, Figure\u00a06D). This finding is consistent with work showing long timescales and integration of navigationally relevant variables in RSP and parietal areas (, , ). We also compared encoding in layer 2/3 and layer 5. The types of task variables encoded were similar across layers (Figure\u00a0S7D). Also, the differences in encoded features between areas were consistent for both layers. However, encoding was generally stronger in layer 5 than in layer 2/3 (Figure\u00a06E). Although encoding of task features was not uniform across cortical space, it was striking that at least some neural activity in most areas could be explained by any given feature. Except for screen velocity in the most anterior area, the fraction of explainable deviance for any task feature in any of the five areas was significantly greater than zero (Figure\u00a06D). Thus, if an experiment focused solely on a single area, it would likely find encoding of most task parameters of interest. Here, by analyzing a large portion of cortical space in a single study, we were able to find that areas differed not in terms of which features they encoded, but rather in the relative strength with which they encoded those features. Our maps of encoding properties suggested that the distribution of information may be related to the type of feature that is encoded. It appeared that simpler features, such as visual receptive fields, screen velocity, and ball velocity, were more spatially confined than more complex features, such as nonlinear feature interactions and task history. To test this idea, we grouped neurons by their encoding properties into encoding types (as in Figure\u00a03D). We then asked how the features encoded by the neurons of a given type related to the spread of those neurons in cortex, quantified as the area of an ellipse fit to the cortical locations of all neurons of that type (Figure\u00a07A). Encoding types with the strongest encoding of either visual or locomotion velocity had some of the smallest spreads in cortex (Figures 7D and 7E, see colored encoding types). For the encoding of nonlinear interactions and task history, the types with the strongest encoding had intermediate spreads (Figures 7D and 7E, see colored encoding types). We also tested specific encoding of task events, such as rewards, open-loop onset and offset, and drift switches. The few encoding types that had significant event-specific encoding were highly distributed across cortex (Figures 7D and 7E, see colored encoding types). Therefore, encoding types associated with relatively simple stimuli appeared more localized, which is consistent with area specialization for simple visual stimuli (, , ). However, most encoding types showed a wide spread across cortical space (Figure\u00a0S6C). Neurons that were task-related in more complex, but nevertheless reliable, ways, such as nonlinear combinations of sensory, movement, and task features, tended to be highly distributed across cortex. We wanted to understand where task-relevant information, in particular, the relationship between visual and locomotion information, was represented in a format that could be best decoded by a downstream region to solve the task. We focused on decoding of linear combinations of signals because theory suggests that linear representations allow optimal inference in the context of multimodal integration (, ). We developed a simplified version of our encoding model in which task variables did not interact nonlinearly and therefore remained invariant to each other (Figure\u00a08A; STAR Methods). As above, the model took the form of a GLM, but, rather than using the CNN-based feature extractor, we specified manually which task variable combinations and transformations to relate to neural activity. We used Bayes\u2019 rule to invert the GLM and to measure how well individual features could be decoded from the neural activity of small local populations (\u223c50 neurons; STAR Methods). To assess decoding accuracy, we isolated the portion of task variance explained that was due to the neural activity and not due to correlations between the decoded variable and other task variables (STAR Methods). Since features only interacted linearly in the GLM, a high decoding accuracy meant that the neural activity encoded the feature of interest in a manner invariant to other features. The main reward-relevant task variables were the angular optic flow (screen) velocity and angular locomotion (ball) velocity. Optic flow and locomotion velocity were related by the drift velocity. Screen, ball, and drift velocity therefore formed a set of visual, motor, and visual-motor-integration variables. The visual component (angular screen velocity) could be decoded predominantly from the MM region medial to area PM (Figure\u00a08B). The motor component (angular ball velocity) could be decoded from a mediolateral strip that overlapped with the parietal region A (Figure\u00a08B). The visual-motor-integration component (angular drift) could be decoded best in a location that was anterior and medial of the retinotopically defined area AM. This location corresponded to the zone of maximal overlap between the visual and locomotion velocity decoding regions (Figure\u00a08B). Similarly, linear velocity drift could be decoded best where linear visual and locomotion velocity decoding overlapped. These results indicate two significant points. First, the best angular drift decoding was in a location that matched what our previous work has studied as PPC (, , , ). Second, our data suggested that representations formed overlapping maps and that multimodal information could be decoded where the representations of component features overlapped. To test how the combination of multimodal information depended on coherence between sensory and motor signals, we compared decoding performance during the task to decoding performance in the open-loop segments, during which the animal was not in control of the virtual environment (Figure\u00a08D). Using an encoding model fit to closed-loop time points, we decoded task variables during open-loop times. If representations depended on behavioral control, the decoding performance of the closed-loop model was expected to be low during open-loop times. Decoding of angular velocity, the most task-relevant variable, was reduced during open-loop segments for both visual and motor components (Figure\u00a08D, top). Decoding performance\u00a0of linear visual and drift velocity was reduced in secondary and higher areas, but improved in primary visual cortex (Figure\u00a08D, bottom). This suggests a disengagement of secondary and higher areas, and reduction in multimodal representations, when the animal was not in control of the environment. There was no decrease in mean activity in any area during open-loop segments (Figure\u00a0S8E). Together with our optogenetic inhibition results (Figures 1I and 1K), our findings suggest that V1 represents visual-motor mismatch in a task-independent way, whereas higher areas such as PPC and RSP integrate sensory, motor, and task information in a way that depends on coherent interactions with the environment. We further found that the best decoding of higher-order task features was broadly present in association areas (Figure\u00a08E). All of the temporally or spatially integrated features that we considered were best decoded from RSP, consistent with a role for this region in integration of visual information during navigation (, ). Interestingly, however, decoding was not uniform across RSP. Rather, decoding of heading since the last reward was specific to posterior portions of RSP. RSP may therefore have important functional subdivisions. The patterns of decoding across cortical space were broadly consistent for neurons in layer 2/3 and layer 5. However, decoding performance for nearly all features of the task was superior in layer 5 populations (Figures 8C and S8D). Both our experimental design and analysis approach were developed to address the challenges of comparing activity in a wide range of cortical areas. The use of a navigation task likely engages the posterior cortex more strongly than passive viewing of stimuli (, ). Our task was self-guided and continuous, potentially allowing more natural cooperation between brain areas than in rigid trial-based tasks. Also, the space of task variables was sampled densely, rather than at a few pre-defined states, which could help understand the distribution of encoding properties. We developed a neural-network-based feature extractor and combined it with a linear encoding model (, ) to relate neural activity to behavior in a way that requires few prior assumptions about the considered encoding relationships. Instead of relating activity directly to explicitly measured task variables, we started with unsupervised analyses. This approach allowed us to consider relationships that were based on hard-to-interpret features, such as nonlinear interactions or long temporal dependencies. These methodological advances helped us to compare task-related activity across\u00a0widely varying cortical areas within a single experimental paradigm. In the context of our visually guided navigation task, encoding properties formed smooth gradients across large parts of the posterior cortex. The only functional discontinuities in the posterior cortex were found at the major anatomical borders between V1, parietal, and retrosplenial areas. Despite the lack of further discontinuities, different regions could be distinguished based on population-level differences in encoding profiles. On a cellular level, however, encoding properties were strikingly distributed, and most task features were encoded in most areas. Our data appear consistent with a distributed architecture without sharp distinctions between local and long-range connectivity, in which functional similarity is related smoothly to cortical distance. A distributed architecture, in this sense, has been suggested by theoretical work. Modeling has shown that the inter-area connectivity of both primate and rodent cortex can be explained by an organizational rule that acts on the level of single axons (). According to this rule, the probability of a neuron to send an axon into any part of cortex decays smoothly (exponentially) with wiring distance. Networks based on this rule thus form a spatial continuum and lack discrete areas (). Such networks may appear modular in larger brains, such as those of primates, and distributed in smaller brains, such as from rodents, even with the same underlying principle. These models make predictions for the formation and location of multimodal representations. Due to the rule of connectivity decay with distance, multimodal representations are expected to emerge at cortical locations between the peaks of encoding for individual features. We found that multimodal representations were common across the posterior cortex, with most areas having significant encoding of both visual and locomotion signals. This finding is consistent with work showing movement-related signals in primary sensory cortices (, ). However, in our data, multimodal representations emerged to the greatest extent at locations where visual and movement gradients overlapped, most saliently in the location we have studied in depth as PPC, which is anterior and medial to the boundaries of retinotopic area AM (, , , ). At this location, we found an overlap of angular screen and ball velocity encoding and the highest decoding accuracy for the most action-relevant task variable, angular drift. More generally, our study shows that task-related activity can be used to identify functional structure in association areas that have been challenging to map with sensory stimuli. While angular drift could be decoded best in the location we have called PPC, other multimodal signals were present in a large group of areas including PM, MM, A, AM, and RL (as defined in the Allen CCF). This group was active during behavioral change-points (Figure\u00a06) and encoded visual-motor integration features (Figures 6 and 8). A sub-region extending along the anterior-posterior direction (area 3) had the most diverse encoding of all regions (Figure\u00a04) and strongly encoded nonlinear interactions of visual and locomotion features (Figure\u00a06D). We hypothesize that functions typically ascribed to parietal cortex extend throughout this region, potentially in a posterior to anterior gradient from visual-motor integration to learned visually guided motor planning. In addition, our results indicate that area PM has an important role in navigation (, ). Furthermore, RSP had prominent functional subdivisions along the anterior-posterior axis. Beyond multimodal mixing, redundant and recurrently connected neural populations are thought to be requirements for other features of cortical processing. The prevalence of complex nonlinear stimulus transformations and their distributed representation in our data may be a signature of processing for probabilistic\u00a0inference (). Also, the widespread integration signals we found across secondary and association areas are consistent with the sharing of information between neural populations at different stages of a processing stream, as needed for predictive coding (, ). The areas we identified based on the encoding of task information did not line up exactly with retinotopic boundaries. In the secondary visual regions, we found gradients of task encoding, in contrast to the sharp boundaries suggested by retinotopic mapping. Our results also suggested that the spatial structure of encoding may depend on the features considered. Future studies comparing cortical areas should consider the caveats associated with sampling and binning neural activity based on area boundaries defined by specific features, such as retinotopy. Despite the distributed representations we observed, it is possible that computations in cortex could be localized. For example, computations to generate or transform representations could occur selectively in a specialized area and then this information could be broadcast widely. It will thus be of interest to develop experimental approaches that extend beyond encoding to test whether computation is localized or distributed. Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Christopher Harvey (harvey@hms.harvard.edu). All experimental procedures were approved by the Harvard Medical School Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were performed in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All imaging data were obtained from five male C57BL/6J-Tg(Thy1-GCaMP6s) GP4.12Dkim/J mice. For the optogenetic inactivation experiments, three male VGAT-ChR2-YFP mice were used (The Jackson Laboratory). All mice were 8-10\u00a0weeks old at the start of behavioral training, 12-24\u00a0weeks old during imaging and optogenetic experiments, and had not undergone previous procedures. Mice were kept on a reversed 12\u00a0h dark/light cycle and housed in groups of up to four littermates per cage. Mouse health was checked daily. The virtual reality system was programmed in MATLAB using the Psychophysics Toolbox 3. A PicoPro laser projector (Celluon Inc.) back-projected the virtual environment onto a half-cylindrical screen (24 inch diameter) at a framerate of 60\u00a0Hz. The luminance of the image was gamma-corrected and adjusted to account for the curvature of the screen. The virtual environment was updated in response to the mouse\u2019s locomotion on a custom-made open-cell Styrofoam ball (8 inch diameter, \u223c135 g). Two optical sensors (ADNS-9800, Avago Technologies) positioned 45\u00b0 below the equator of the ball and separated by 90\u00b0 in azimuth were connected to a Teensy-3.2 microcontroller (PJRC.COM) to measure the 3-dimensional rotation velocity of the ball. The pitch and roll velocity components controlled the linear and angular velocity in the virtual environment. The velocity gain was adjusted such that the distance traveled in the virtual environment equaled the distance traveled on the surface of the ball. The virtual environment consisted of 6,000 dots placed uniformly at random in a 4\u00a0m by 4\u00a0m wide and 5\u00a0m high virtual arena. Movement\u00a0of the mouse on the ball caused corresponding translation of the dots through the arena. The arena had continuous boundary conditions such that dots leaving the bounds on one side reappeared on the other. The viewpoint of the mouse was located in the center of the arena. Only dots within a radius of 2\u00a0m from the viewpoint of the mouse were visible. All dots had a diameter of 63\u00a0mm in the virtual world, corresponding to 1.8\u00b0 of visual space at a distance of 2 m. Dots closer than 1\u00a0m from the mouse were collapsed in height onto the floor of the arena. The dots were either black or white, on a gray background. Each dot had a lifetime of 1 s, after which it vanished and a new dot was generated at a random location. Mice were trained to run along a straight path for a fixed distance (\u201cgoal distance\u201d) away from an invisible reference point to obtain a\u00a0reward (4\u00a0\u03bcl of 10% sweetened condensed milk in water). The goal distance was adjusted daily to maintain the reward rate between 2 and 5 rewards per minute and was 2.21\u00a0\u00b1 0.23\u00a0m (mean\u00a0\u00b1 s.d.) for the imaging sessions. To detect deviation from a straight path, we continuously measured the position of the reference point in relation to a triangular reward detection zone (Figure\u00a01B). The reward detection zone was an isosceles triangle whose apex was at the mouse\u2019s current position\u00a0and whose base was behind the mouse and orthogonal to the mouse\u2019s current heading direction. The goal distance defined the height of the triangle and the base had a fixed length of 1 m. When the reference point crossed any edge of the triangle due to the mouse\u2019s locomotion, the point was reset to the current position of the mouse. If the point left the triangle by crossing its base, a reward was delivered. This mechanism rewarded the mouse for moving away from the current reference point in a straight path. The triangular reward detection zone ensured that more recent path segments were weighted more heavily than segments further in the past in determining the straightness of the mouse\u2019s path. To decorrelate the locomotion velocity from the optic flow on the screen, we added a drift to the movement of the mouse through the virtual environment. The drift velocity remained constant for 6-12\u00a0s (interval chosen uniformly at random). Then, new values were randomly drawn from a normal distribution, independently for the forward and angular directions. The standard deviation of the angular drift component was 18\u00b0/s. For comparison, the standard deviation of the angular running velocity during the task was 15.6\u00b0/s (after subtracting the drift). The standard deviation of the forward drift component was 0.06\u00a0m/s (s.d. of forward running velocity\u00a0after subtracting drift, 0.17\u00a0m/s). To obtain data where locomotion and optic flow were completely decorrelated, we included a segment of open-loop playback after every ninth drift segment. During open-loop playback, we displayed a visual stimulus that was\u00a0identical to the preceding 6-12\u00a0s of closed-loop behavior. No rewards were delivered during the open-loop segments. Before behavioral training, a titanium headplate was affixed to the skull of each mouse using dental cement (Metabond, Parkell). The center of the headplate was positioned over left posterior cortex (2.25\u00a0mm lateral and 2.50\u00a0mm posterior from bregma). To allow for an imaging plane parallel to the surface of cortex, the headplate was tilted by 16\u00b0 from horizontal around the anterior-posterior axis. While performing the task, mice were head-restrained so that the headplate was tilted at 16\u00b0 and the skull was level. Starting three days before the first training session, mice were put on a water restriction schedule which limited their total consumption to 1\u00a0mL per day. The weight of each mouse was monitored daily and additional water was given if the weight fell below 80% of the pre-training weight. Mice were trained daily for 45-60\u00a0min at approximately the same time each day. Initially, the drift velocity\u00a0was set to zero and the goal distance was set to a low value such that any movement on the ball would result in a reward. The goal distance was increased automatically after each reward within a session, and the initial and maximal goal distance were adjusted between sessions to maintain the reward rate between 2 and 5 rewards per minute. Once mice reached a goal distance of 2 m, drift was gradually introduced over several sessions. Training took approximately 2\u00a0weeks. Three male VGAT-ChR2-YFP mice were used for the optogenetic inactivation experiments (The Jackson Laboratory). For these experiments,\u00a0we followed the procedures described in (). The mouse was anaesthetized with isoflurane (1%\u20132% in air). The scalp was resected to expose the entire dorsal surface of the skull. The periosteum was removed but the bone was left intact. A thin layer of cyanoacrylate glue was applied to the bone (Insta-Cure, Bob Smith Industries), followed by a layer of transparent dental acrylic (Jet Repair Acrylic, Lang Dental, P/N 1223-clear). A bar-shaped head plate was affixed to the skull posterior to the lambdoid suture using dental cement (Metabond, Parkell). Mice were then trained to perform the task. Once mice reached steady state performance, they were anesthetized again and their skull cap was polished with a polishing drill (Model 6100, Vogue Professional) using denture polishing bits (HP0412, AZDENT). After polishing, clear nail polish was applied (Electron\u00a0Microscopy Sciences, 72180). Fiducial marks were made on the skull cap to aid in laser alignment. An aluminum ring was then affixed to the skull using dental cement mixed with India ink to prevent stimulation light from reaching the mouse\u2019s eyes. Light from a 470\u00a0nm collimated diode laser (LRD-0470-PFR-00200, Laserglow Technologies) was coupled into a pair of galvanometric scan mirrors (6210H, Cambridge Technology) and focused onto the skull by an achromatic doublet lens (f\u00a0= 300\u00a0mm, AC508-300-A-ML, Thorlabs). The laser (analog power modulation, off to 95% power rise time, 50\u00a0\u03bcs) and mirrors (< 5\u00a0ms step time for steps up to 20\u00a0mm) allowed simultaneous stimulation of several sites by rapidly moving the beam between them. The beam of the diode laser had a top-hat profile with a diameter at the focus of approximately 200\u00a0\u03bcm. For the grid-based inhibition mapping, stimulation trials were performed continuously throughout the behavioral session. For each stimulation trial, we randomly selected which hemisphere to stimulate (left, right or both), and then randomly selected one of 72 stimulation\u00a0sites (per hemisphere) (Figure\u00a01I). All sites were stimulated once before the first site was stimulated again. Sites were spaced in a regular grid at 500\u00a0\u03bcm intervals. During these experiments, we set the drift velocity in the task to zero. For the inhibitions during the full task (with drift), two drift values were used (18\u00b0/s and \u221218\u00b0/s) and were switched every four seconds. The laser onset was aligned to the drift switch and the laser was on for six seconds. Inhibition trials were performed randomly at every second or third drift switch. The coordinates of the targeted sites, in millimeters lateral and posterior from bregma, were 2.5, \u22124\u00a0(V1), 1.5, \u22124 (V1/PM), 1.75, \u22122 (PPC), and 0.5, \u22122.5 (RSP) (Figure\u00a01K). For control trials, the laser was targeted at a location on the\u00a0metal headplate. Unilateral and bilateral trials were randomly interleaved. Following Guo et\u00a0al., the laser power at each stimulation site had a near-sinusoidal temporal profile (40\u00a0Hz) and time average of 5.7\u00a0mW. To ensure identical stimulus properties and mirror sounds, for unilateral stimulations, we still moved the laser between two sites, but the second site targeted the head-plate so that the light did not reach the brain. After mice reached steady task performance, the cranial window surgery was performed. Twelve hours before the surgery, mice received a dose of dexamethasone (2\u00a0\u03bcg per g body weight). For the surgery, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (1%\u20132% in air). The dental cement covering the skull was removed and a circular craniotomy with a diameter slightly greater than 4\u00a0mm was made over the left hemisphere (centered 2.25\u00a0mm lateral and 2.50\u00a0mm posterior from bregma). The dura was removed. A glass plug consisting of two 4\u00a0mm diameter coverslips and one 5\u00a0mm diameter coverslip (#1 thickness, CS-4R and CS-5R, Warner Instruments), glued together with optical adhesive (NOA68, Norland), was inserted into the craniotomy and fixed in place with dental cement. India ink was mixed into the dental cement to prevent light contamination from the visual stimulus. An aluminum ring was then affixed to the head plate with dental cement. During imaging, this ring interfaced with light shielding around the microscope objective to prevent light contamination. Retinotopic maps were collected for the mice used for calcium imaging. Mapping was performed as described before (). Mice were lightly anaesthetized with isoflurane (0.5 \u2013 1.0% in air). GCaMP fluorescence (excitation, 455\u00a0nm; emission, 469\u00a0nm) was collected with a tandem-lens macroscope. A periodic visual stimulus consisting of a spherically corrected black and white checkered moving bar () was presented on a 27 inch IPS LCD monitor (MG279Q, Asus). The monitor was positioned in front of the right eye at an angle of 30 degrees from the mouse\u2019s midline. Retinotopic maps were computed by taking the temporal Fourier transform of the imaging data at each pixel and extracting the phase of the signal at the stimulus frequency (). The phase images were smoothed using a Gaussian filter (100\u00a0\u03bcm s.d.) and the field sign was computed (). Data were collected using a custom-build rotating two-photon microscope. The entire scan head of the microscope was mounted on a gantry that could be translated along two axes (dorsal-ventral and medial-lateral with respect to the mouse). The objective and collection optics were attached to the scan head assembly and could be rotated around the third axis, such that the objective could be positioned freely within the coronal plane of the mouse. Additionally, the spherical treadmill was mounted on a three-axis translation stage (Dover Motion) to position the mouse with respect to the objective. We positioned the objective such that the image plane was parallel to the left hemisphere of dorsal posterior cortex (approximately 16 degrees from horizontal). The head of the mouse remained\u00a0in its natural position. Excitation light (920\u00a0nm) from a titanium sapphire laser (Chameleon Ultra II, Coherent) was coupled into the scan head via periscopes aligned with the gantry. The scan head consisted of a resonant and a galvanometric scan mirror, separated by a scan lens-based relay telescope, and allowed for fast scanning. Average power at the sample was 60-70 mW. The collection optics were housed in an aluminum box to block light from the visual display. Emitted light was filtered (525/50\u00a0nm, Semrock) and collected by a GaAsP photomultiplier tube. The microscope was controlled by ScanImage 2016 (Vidrio Technologies). Images were acquired at 30\u00a0Hz at a resolution of 512\u00a0\u00d7 512 pixels (650\u00a0\u03bcm \u00d7 650\u00a0\u03bcm). The imaging depth below the dura was either between 120\u00a0\u03bcm and 170\u00a0\u03bcm (layer 2/3) or between 300\u00a0\u03bcm and 500\u00a0\u03bcm (layer 5). Imaging was continuous for the duration of the behavioral session, lasting between 55 and 70\u00a0min. We found that there was slow axial drift of approximately 6\u00a0\u03bcm/h, possibly due to physiological changes as the animal consumed liquid rewards. To compensate for the drift, the stage was moved continuously at a similar rate. The rate was adjusted between sessions based on residual drift observed between the beginning and end of each session. To synchronize imaging and behavioral data, the imaging frame clock and projector frame clock were recorded. Before each two-photon imaging session, an image of the surface vasculature was recorded directly above the coordinates of the imaging session. To align each two-photon session to the retinotopic map for each mouse, matching features in the vasculature were identified manually between the two-photon surface vasculature image and an image of the vasculature obtained during retinotopic mapping. Using the features as control points, a similarity transformation (translation, rotation and scaling) was computed to align the two-photon imaging data to the retinotopic map (Figures S1A\u2013S1D). To combine data across mice, we aligned the field sign map of each mouse to a CCF-aligned reference field sign map available from the Allen Institute (http://portal.brain-map.org/) (Figures 2D and S1E). For each mouse, we first obtained outlines of V1 and AM, which were defined as pixels in the field sign map with an absolute value less than 0.06 (the field sign ranges from \u22121.0 to 1.0). We then manually determined the rotation and translation that best aligned the outlines of V1 and area AM to the CCF-aligned reference map (Figure\u00a0S1E). This registration provided a position for each neuron in coordinates from the CCF. Since two-photon imaging and widefield-imaging for retinotopic mapping were performed through the same imaging window, the alignment error between two-photon sessions within each mouse was expected to be very small. However, greater errors could be introduced during the registration to the CCF. We therefore estimated the potential error in identifying a neuron\u2019s position due to the alignment procedure by using data from the Allen Institute that included, for individual mice, field sign maps with ground-truth CCF coordinates. To mimic our alignment procedure, we registered a field sign map from a single Allen Institute mouse to the average field sign map from their other mice. We estimated the CCF coordinates from the alignment and compared these coordinates to the real positions known for that mouse. This procedure was identical to the methods we used to align data across mice and to register our data to the CCF. This alignment introduced errors in the range of 100 to 130\u00a0\u03bcm (Figure\u00a0S1F), which is smaller than the smallest posterior brain regions and less than the relevant length scales for most of our analyses. All image processing was performed in MATLAB. Before source extraction, in-plane motion was corrected using a hierarchical approach. First, fast motion artifacts were corrected within blocks of 1000 frames using the Lucas-Kanade method (). Then, the average images of each corrected 1000-frame block were aligned to the average image of the middle block of the session to correct for slow changes. In three consecutive steps, we found a rigid, then an affine, and finally a nonrigid transformation using MATLAB functions imregtform and imregdemons. The successive transformations were combined into one displacement field using cubic interpolation and applied to the image data in a single step to minimize interpolation artifacts. We found the stepwise motion correction procedure to be necessary for robust nonrigid motion correction. Preprocessing code is available\u00a0at https://github.com/HarveyLab/Acquisition2P_class/. After motion correction, the spatial footprints of fluorescence sources were identified using a modified version of the constrained non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF) framework (). For CNMF, we used down-sampled image data to conserve space and reduce noise (from 30\u00a0Hz to 1.2\u00a0Hz). We used three unregularized background components to model temporally and spatially varying neuropil fluorescence. The procedure to initialize source footprints was modified compared to the original CNMF. We used an approach that identified sources independently of their anatomical shape and could identify both cell bodies and neurites. First, the field of view was divided into overlapping tiles (52 pixels edge length, 6 pixels overlap). The temporal correlation matrix  between all pixels in a tile was computed and used to construct a graph with edge weights  between pixels  and . Spectral clustering was then applied to the graph to segment the pixels within the tile into a pre-determined number of subregions with high temporal correlations between the pixels of each subregion (). Subregions with temporal correlations greater than 0.9 were assumed to be fragments of the same source and merged. The subregions were used to initialize the CNMF algorithm. The fluorescence traces returned by CNMF were then normalized by their baseline fluorescence. The CNMF approach absorbs both out-of-focus neuropil fluorescence and the true baseline fluorescence of each source into the background components. We therefore used nonnegative regression (MATLAB lsqnonneg) to separate the background fluorescence at the pixels occupied by each source into a component that varied spatially like the source footprint, and an offset that modeled diffuse fluorescence. The regression coefficient of the source-shaped background component was used as the baseline. The fluorescence trace of each source was divided by its baseline to obtain the change over baseline . Finally, traces were deconvolved using the OASIS algorithm with a first-order autoregressive model and individually optimized decay constants (). Our version of CNMF did not impose a spatial prior on the extracted fluorescence sources and therefore returned sources with irregular\u00a0spatial footprints, in addition to soma-shaped footprints. We used a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) in MATLAB\u00a0to classify source footprints by shape into somata, transverse processes (small dot-shaped sources), and artifacts (Figures S1H\u2013S1L). The CNN took as input a 25-by-25 pixel image of the source footprint returned by CNMF. The input was processed by three convolutional layers (filter size, 5\u00a0\u00d7 5; channels, 6; stride, 1), followed by a fully connected layer (64 units) and a softmax output layer. All layers were connected by rectified linear units. The training data consisted of 1884 manually labeled source images, augmented by random rotation and translation to 300,000 samples. The network was trained using stochastic gradient descent with momentum (batch size, 512; learning rate 0.03; L2 regularization, 0.0001, otherwise default settings of sgdm in MATLAB). Classification\u00a0accuracy was confirmed using held-out data to be similar to manual classification. We used a similar approach to classify fluorescence traces into traces with calcium transients, traces with low signal-to-noise ratio, and traces containing artifacts (Figures S1H\u2013S1L). The trace-classification CNN took as input the normalized fluorescence trace. The\u00a0input was processed by two convolutional layers (filter size, 1\u00a0\u00d7 16; channels, 4 and 8; stride, 1), followed by a max-pooling layer that reduced the trace to 8 points per channel, a fully connected layer (64 units), and a softmax output layer. All layers were connected by rectified linear units. The network was trained using stochastic gradient descent with momentum (batch size, 64; learning rate 0.01; L2 regularization, 0.001, otherwise default settings of sgdm in MATLAB). The training data consisted of 1586 manually labeled traces. Classification accuracy was confirmed using held-out data to be similar to manual classification. The only sources used for further analyses were those that had either soma or transverse-process shapes and traces that contained calcium transients (total, 23,213; soma, 18,127; transverse process, 5,086). In the text we refer to both soma-shaped and transverse-process-shaped fluorescence sources as \u201cneurons.\u201d Data preprocessing was performed in MATLAB (MathWorks) and all main analyses were performed using Python 3. Except for the CNN and GLM, which used TensorFlow, most analyses used the Scikit-learn Python library. Data and analysis pipelines were organized\u00a0using DataJoint. Statistical confidence and significance were generally computed by hierarchical bootstrapping. To estimate the uncertainty of a statistic (e.g., the mean) of a sample, the statistic was recomputed many times for resampled datasets. The datasets were generated by random sampling with replacement, first of the mice, then of the imaging sessions within the sample of mice, and then of the neurons within the sample of sessions. Resampled datasets had the same size as the original dataset. 1000 resampled datasets were generated unless noted otherwise. The resampling of mice was constrained such that at least two different mice were in each resampled\u00a0population. The hierarchical procedure was used to account for the fact that sources from the same session and sessions from the same mouse were statistically not fully independent. We reported the 5th and 95th percentile of the bootstrap distribution as the confidence intervals. For significance testing, we computed the empirical probability that a bootstrap sample was greater or less than the null hypothesis value, whichever was smaller. The reported two-tailed p value was twice this probability. Unless indicated otherwise, the significance threshold was set at 0.05. Where indicated, we accounted for multiple comparisons by controlling the false discovery rate with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (): For a given false discovery rate  and ascending list of p values  corresponding to the  hypotheses that were tested, we found the largest  such that . We then rejected the null hypothesis for all hypotheses up to . The number of samples (n) and p values were reported in the figure legends. For behavior analyses (Figure\u00a01), n typically referred to the number of mice. For analyses of neuronal properties, n typically referred to the number of neurons. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. For each experiment, all mice received the same experimental treatment. Therefore, there was no stratification, subject-level randomization or experimenter blinding during any stage of the study. Behavioral sessions were excluded from analysis if the animal did not receive at least 1.5 rewards per minute for at least 20\u00a0minutes. Imaging sessions were excluded if there was noticeable drift after motion correction. We assessed the effect of optogenetic perturbation at each cortical location on the locomotion velocities and reward rate. Perturbation trials were only included if the mouse was performing the task (greater than 1.5 rewards per minute, computed in a four-minute running average). For the mapping experiments (Figure\u00a01I), we obtained 33,045 trials (158.87\u00a0\u00b1 21.14 per location, mean\u00a0\u00b1 s.d.) in 19 sessions from three mice. Although mice were trained on the full task (randomized drift velocity), no drift was used for the mapping sessions since we wanted to assess the effect of inhibition on locomotion without the additional complexity of changing visual-motor mappings. For analysis, to increase the number of trials, we pooled trials across neighboring positions in the 500\u00a0\u03bcm grid. Therefore, each point in Figure\u00a01I is based on the trials at the indicated location and the up to eight immediate neighbors. In each trial, we computed the change in locomotion velocity between 300\u00a0ms before laser onset and the time of laser offset. The resulting values constituted the test distribution. To obtain a null distribution, we computed the change in the task variable between equally spaced time points in the preceding inter-trial-interval. Even though there might be residual effects from previous trials, due to the randomization of stimulation locations, we assumed these effects to be zero on average. We then computed the difference between the test value and the null value for each trial, and used hierarchical bootstrapping to obtain a p value for the null hypothesis that the mean of the difference was zero. These p values were reported in Figure\u00a01I. For the targeted experiments (Figure\u00a01K), we obtained 10,596 trials (815.08\u00a0\u00b1 505.86 per location, mean\u00a0\u00b1 s.d.) in 30 sessions (same three mice as for the mapping experiments). The average reward rate was computed for the final two seconds of each inhibition trial, i.e., the period after the drift switch. The encoding of task variables was analyzed by fitting a convolutional neural network (CNN) that predicted the activity of all recorded\u00a0neurons simultaneously, based on the measured task variables. The model was programmed in Python 3 using TensorFlow 1.3.0. The input to the model consisted of a 4\u00a0s long snippet of task and behavioral information. Based on this input, the neural activity at a single time point 3\u00a0s into the snippet was predicted. Therefore, neurons whose activity was related to task features up to 3\u00a0s in the past and up to 1\u00a0s into the future could be modeled. The length of the snippet was chosen to approximately match the longest task events. For example, the time taken by the mouse to stop running for a reward, consume the reward, and re-accelerate was approximately 4\u00a0s (Figure\u00a06A). One snippet was created for each time point, i.e., adjacent snippets overlapped. All data (task variables and fluorescence activity) were resampled at 10\u00a0Hz for the model to reduce the amount of data. Only time points in which the mouse performed the task (greater than 1.5 rewards per minute, computed in a four-minute running average) were included, and only sessions with at least 20\u00a0minutes of task performance were included (118 sessions in total, 23.6\u00a0\u00b1 5.99 sessions per mouse, 60.52\u00a0\u00b1 9.02\u00a0minutes of task performance per session, mean\u00a0\u00b1 s.d.). Nine task variables were used as inputs in the full model: Linear ball velocity (ball pitch), angular ball velocity (ball roll), ball yaw (not\u00a0used to control virtual reality), linear screen velocity, angular screen velocity, time since last reward, time since last drift switch, time since last open-loop onset and time since last open-loop offset. The inclusion of the temporal variables meant that activity related to these task events could be modeled even beyond the 4\u00a0s length of the input snippet. The measured ball pitch, roll and yaw velocities were normalized by scaling with a session-specific factor. The factor was optimized such that the velocity histogram of each session best matched (in a least-squares sense) the velocity histogram of all sessions combined. The same factors were applied to ball and screen velocities. Scale factors were small (range, 0.62 \u2013 1.77, 5th to 95th percentile, 0.76 \u2013 1.28), but were included to ensure that variations in average locomotion speed would not lead to trivial differences in the encoding weights between sessions. The output of the model was the predicted deconvolved fluorescence trace, in units of \u0394F/F0. The model consisted of a nonlinear stage (CNN) that was shared across all sessions and neurons, and a neuron-specific linear readout stage (GLM, Figure\u00a02F). The input layer was followed by three 1d-convolutional layers that convolved the input snippet across time with learned filters of size 6 (0.6 s). Each convolutional layer had 32 channels. The output of the last convolutional layer was flattened and connected densely to a layer with 128 units, which was connected to another dense layer with 64 units (\u201cTask factors\u201d layer in Figure\u00a02F). This was the last layer in the shared stage. Between the layers in the shared stage, a leaky rectification nonlinearity\u00a0of the form  was applied to the activations. The neuron-specific stage consisted of a single readout layer that computed a linear combination of the activations in the bottleneck layer. This layer had a separate set of weights for each neuron. The output of this layer modeled the logarithm of the deconvolved fluorescence trace. The nonlinear (shared) stage of the model therefore reduced the high-dimensional task information into 64 variables (\u201ctask factors\u201d) that were most relevant for explaining the neural activity. The task factors were the same for all modeled neurons. The second stage then formed a separate generalized linear model for each neuron that used the 64 task factors as predictors. In addition to the task factors, two further features were included as predictors in the second stage (GLM) of the model. The first was the output of a separately fitted model of visual receptive fields (see section Visual Receptive Fields). Therefore, the CNN was trained to fit only the residual activity that was not already explained by the visual receptive field. The second was a time-varying offset designed to capture slow, behavior-independent fluctuations in neural activity throughout the session. The offset was modeled as a cubic polynomial of the normalized time within the session. The parameters of the polynomial were fitted jointly with all other network parameters. Network weights were initialized with normally distributed random values. Random values that fell more than two standard deviations from zero were dropped and redrawn (tensorflow.truncated_normal). The standard deviation was set to , where  was the number of inputs to that layer. Biases were initialized with zero. The network was trained to minimize a loss function based on the Poisson likelihood of the neural activity, given the prediction (tensorflow.nn.log_poisson_loss). To prevent overfitting, the sum of the squared weights of all main network layers was added to the loss function, scaled by 9.17\u00a0\u00d7 10\u22127 (this and other hyperparameters were optimized, see below). In addition, dropout with a probability of 0.5 was applied during training to the convolutional and first densely connected layer. The visual receptive field input and the time-varying offset were not regularized. Fitting was done by stochastic gradient descent using the Adam optimizer with the following parameters: learning rate, 0.0027; \u03b21, 0.89; \u03b22, 0.9999, batch size 4096. Each batch contained a random sample of all sessions,\u00a0such that each weight update included contributions from most sessions. Randomization was performed such that all sessions contributed to the weight updates equally on average. For training, 80 percent of the data was used, with the remaining 20 percent held out for model evaluation. The split between training and test set was done in 20 s-long segments, which was longer than the autocorrelation time of the data. Every fifth segment was assigned to the test set. Care was taken to ensure that no test data were included in the training set. Model fit quality was always reported for the test set. Model fit quality was quantified using the Poisson deviance,between data  and prediction  at time points . We reported the fit quality in terms of the fraction of Poisson deviance explained by the model, compared to a null model that predicts the mean of the data at all datapoints: . We only included activity sources with fits explaining at least 10% of the deviance in subsequent analyses.  The following hyperparameters were optimized using the Bayesian Optimization Python package (https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization): learning rate, batch size, number of convolutional layers, number of channels in convolutional layers, size of the first densely connected layer, size of the bottleneck layer, size of the convolutional filter, degree of the time-varying offset polynomial, Adam parameters. The model performance was robust to most of these parameters and varied mostly in the time to reach convergence, rather than the fit quality at convergence. Based on extensive hyperparameter optimization, we believe that the fit quality\u00a0we obtained was close to the optimum attainable with the general nonlinear-linear-exponential architecture we used. In separate\u00a0tests (data not shown), we found that the model fit could be improved slightly by adding a separate nonlinear readout network for each neuron, but at the cost of not being able to compare readout weights across neurons easily. To measure the unique contribution of different input variables to the overall fit quality (Figure\u00a06), we constructed reduced models that lacked a variable. For each neuron, we computed the difference between the deviance explained by the full model and the deviance explained by the reduced model. This difference describes the deviance uniquely attributable to the variable that was missing in the reduced model. We reported this value as a fraction of the full-model deviance: . For the variables shown in Figures 6 and 7, the reduced models were modified from the full model as follows:For visual receptive fields, the visual receptive field input was removed.For ball velocity, the linear ball velocity, angular ball velocity, and ball yaw inputs were removed.For screen velocity, the linear screen velocity and angular screen velocity were removed.For nonlinear interactions, the convolutional layers were changed to \u201cdepthwise\u201d convolutions, which apply a different filter to each input channel without cross-channel mixing. Also, the nonlinearity between the first densely connected layer and the bottleneck layer was removed. Therefore, there was no nonlinear mixing between the nine task variables in this model.For task history, the length of the input snippet was reduced from 3\u00a0s past and 1\u00a0s future task information with respect to the predicted neural activity time point, to 0.3\u00a0s past and 0.1\u00a0s future task information.For task features (Figure\u00a07), the time since last reward, time since last drift switch, time since last open-loop onset and time since last open-loop offset inputs were removed. These variables accounted for a significant amount of deviance in only a small number of neurons and were therefore not included as a map in Figure\u00a06. Similar to non-identifiability in classical factor analysis, the factors obtained from the encoding model were not uniquely identifiable: theoretically, certain linearly transformed versions of the readout weight vectors could provide equally good model fits. Therefore, re-fitting the model with different random initializations of the neural network weights could lead to factors that appear different when considering individual factors. However, linear transformations (e.g., rotations) of the factor space do not change the intrinsic structure (relative positions) of the data points in this space. We performed controls to show that our main analyses captured properties of this structure that were robust to the non-identifiability (Figure\u00a0S2). We re-fit the full model 100 times with different random initializations of the neural network weights. For each initialization, we recomputed the encoding maps, average encoding map rate of change, -means clustering of encoding maps, and cluster discriminability scores (Figure\u00a0S2C). To assess variability in the location of cluster boundaries for the -means clustering of encoding maps, we defined pixels to be at a boundary if at least one of its neighbors belonged to a different cluster than itself. For each pixel, we then computed the probability of it being a boundary pixel (Figure\u00a0S2D). We estimated a linear visual receptive field for each neuron and included the receptive field prediction in the CNN. This had two purposes. First, we wanted to ensure that we did not incorrectly attribute velocity tuning to neurons with simple linear visual receptive fields. Second, linear visual receptive fields are a well-studied encoding property that served as a useful comparison for the encoding maps in Figure\u00a06. Visual receptive fields were estimated based on the neural activity and screen content recorded while mice performed the task. The images displayed on the screen were downsampled to 79 by 107 pixels and reshaped into a pixels-by-time points visual stimulus matrix. The visual stimulus was shifted in time by 100\u00a0ms to account for various lags between the stimulus display and the detection of fluorescence activity. The linear visual receptive field was estimated for each neuron using a spike-triggered average based on a regularized pseudo-inverse (),where  is the visual stimulus matrix that has been augmented with a regularization matrix,  is the neural response that has been normalized and augmented with zeros, and  is the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of matrix . The regularization matrix was a second-derivative matrix designed to penalize differences between adjacent points in the receptive field map and therefore encouraged smoothness (). The strength of the regularization was chosen to maximize prediction performance on a held-out test set (same train/test split as for the CNN). To reduce background noise, a Gabor filter was fit to the receptive field map using a grid search over 36 evenly spaced orientations and 10 log-spaced spatial frequencies from 0.02 to 0.3 cycles per degree, and the receptive field map was scaled by the envelope of the best-fit Gabor filter. The fit quality of the receptive field map was assessed by fitting a Poisson generalized linear model to the deconvolved fluorescence activity, with the linear prediction of the receptive field estimate as\u00a0its sole input. For neurons where the receptive field did not explain any of their activity (fraction of deviance explained on the test set \u2264 0), the receptive field estimate was set to zero.  The activity prediction based on the visual receptive field estimate was used in the CNN along with the 64 task factors from the\u00a0shared stage of the CNN to predict the activity of each neuron. A single weight was fitted as part of the CNN training to scale the visual prediction. We estimated the visual receptive fields separately from the CNN because the high dimensionality of the visual stimulus made joint fitting infeasible. The area of cortex covered by our imaging data was divided into a pixel grid with 100\u00a0\u03bcm spacing. Only pixels containing data from at least two imaging sessions were shown. Maps were based on the CNN encoding weights of all neurons with a fraction of explained deviance greater than 0.1. Weights for each task factor were z-scored by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation across neurons. Each pixel in the maps was a weighted average of the normalized encoding weights of all neurons, where the averaging weight of each source decayed with the distance between the source and the pixel according to a Gaussian kernel. The smoothness (standard deviation of the Gaussian) was optimized by cross-validation across mice. A map was computed with the data from four mice, and used to predict the weights of the fifth mouse. This was repeated for all five mice and for 20 smoothness values from 0.2 to 3.0\u00a0mm. The least-squares fit quality was averaged across mice and the smoothness value with the best fit quality was chosen for the map. If the best value was 3.0\u00a0mm, the map was considered to have no spatial structure and was shown as a flat image. For regularization, pseudo-data were added to each pixel that had the value of the global mean of all data points and amounted in weight to one tenth of the number of data points in the pixel with the most data points. The regularization reduced noise in areas of low neuron density (e.g., at the edge of the recorded area) by biasing the maps to their mean value. To test whether there were consistent spatial locations at which encoding weights changed, we computed the spatial rate of change of pixel values in each of the encoding weight maps. The rate of change was computed using the central difference between pixels along the rows and columns of the map. From the 2-dimensional gradient vector at each pixel, the magnitude was computed. The resulting map of encoding rate of change was normalized between zero and one and the maps for all task factors were averaged. Area parcellations based on encoding properties were created by applying k-means clustering (sklearn.cluster.KMeans) to the pixels of the 64 encoding maps. Each map pixel represented a datapoint in a 64-dimensional space. For each value of k, 300 random initializations and up to 1000 iterations were used. The cluster order and color was determined by applying metric multidimensional scaling (sklearn.manifold.MDS) to the cluster centroids to embed them into a one-dimensional space. The clusters were then ordered and colored according to their distance in the embedding from the most anterior area. Similarity in color therefore reflected similarity in encoding properties. The fraction variance explained by each clustering was computed as , where  was the sum of squared distances of data points (map pixels) to their nearest cluster centroid, and  was the sum of squared distances from the mean of all data points. For comparison, the same clustering analysis was applied to maps simulated according to two simple models (Figure\u00a03C): In the \u201csimulated gradients\u201d model, each map consisted of a radial gradient centered at a random map location. In the \u201csimulated clusters\u201d model, each map contained the same clustered structure (taken from the Allen Institute parcellation, six clusters), but with a different, normally distributed random intensity for each cluster in each map. Simulated maps were scaled to match the range of the real encoding maps. To match the explainable variance of the simulated maps to the real data, normally distributed random noise was added independently to each map pixel. The standard deviation of the noise was chosen to minimize the squared difference in the variance-explained curve (Figure\u00a03C) between the models and the real data. 100 simulation repeats were performed for each model. Significance of the difference in model fit quality for the variance-explained curve was tested by bootstrap. For each of 10\u22124 iterations, 100 samples were drawn with replacement from each model\u2019s simulation repeats, the mean variance-explained curve was computed for each model, and their squared difference from the real data. The p value was computed as the fraction of bootstrap samples in which the \u201csimulated clusters\u201d model had a lower error than the \u201csimulated gradients\u201d model. For the area discriminability classifier, neurons were first clustered (sklearn.cluster.KMeans) into \u201cencoding types\u201d based on their encoding vectors (normalized to unit length). The goal of this step was to discretize encoding properties to simplify the subsequent analyses. The number of clusters was set to 100. This number approximately maximized the area discriminability. However, results were not very sensitive to the number of clusters for values between 50 and 1000. We used a naive Bayes classifier (sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB) to test how discriminable the areas were from each other in each of the parcellations in Figure\u00a03B. Each area was characterized by how many neurons of each encoding type it contained. Based on these counts, the classifier modeled the probability that a given population of neurons (also characterized by its type frequencies) originated from each of the areas. To test the discriminability of areas in a parcellation, encoding types were obtained and a classifier was trained based on the data from four mice, and used to compute the probability that the population in each area from the fifth mouse came from each of the areas. This was repeated for all five mice and the confusion probabilities were averaged across mice. For each true area, the predicted area was the area to which the classifier assigned the highest probability. For each parcellation in Figure\u00a03B, the fraction of correctly classified areas was computed and reported in Figure\u00a03E. The chance probability was , where  was the number of areas, i.e., probability of choosing the correct one out of  areas when choosing uniformly at random. Agglomerative clustering was used to visualize major patterns in the spatial distribution of encoding weights. The 64-dimensional encoding weight vector of each neuron was normalized to unit length, such that the clustering depended only on the encoding properties (vector direction) of the neurons, rather than also on their activity levels (vector length). The 64 task factors were agglomeratively clustered using the correlations between the weights of each factor across all neurons as the clustering metric, with the average as the linkage method. This meant that factors that had high weights for similar subsets of the neurons were clustered together. To generate the map for a cluster of factors, the weight maps (as computed for Figure\u00a02J) for all factors in that cluster were averaged. To visualize the distribution of neurons across weight space, the 64-dimensional encoding vectors were reduced to two dimensions using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE; sklearn.manifold.TSNE). The output of t-SNE depends strongly on the perplexity parameter. We therefore tested perplexities between 50 and 1600 and chose 200, which was the value that produced the most pronounced structure in the visualization. We computed the t-SNE embedding 10 times with perplexity 200 at different values for the learning rate, and chose the one that had the lowest Kullback-Leibler divergence between the low-dimensional embedding and the high-dimensional data. The same embedding was used for Figures 4A, 4C, S5B, and S5F. The fraction of nearest neighbors in encoding space in each area (Figure\u00a04E) was computed using the full 64-dimensional encoding vectors. Neurons were first randomly subsampled to obtain the same number of sources from each area. Then, for each remaining neuron in one mouse, the nearest neighbor in encoding space among the sources from the other four mice was found. This was repeated for each of the mice. To obtain confidence intervals, this entire process was repeated 200 times on hierarchically resampled datasets. Figure\u00a04E shows the mean across resampled datasets and the 5th percentile. The upper confidence interval was omitted for clarity of visualization. The normalized total encoding-weight dispersion of the neurons in each area (Figure\u00a04F) was computed by summing the variances of the encoding weights along each of the 64 dimensions and dividing by the total dispersion of the whole population. Confidence intervals (5th and 95th percentile) were based on hierarchical bootstrap (500 iterations). Encoding types and area parcellations in Figure\u00a05 were defined as for Figure\u00a03. The empirical prior area probability  (i.e., the number of neurons in each area, divided by the total number of neurons) and the empirical likelihood of encoding types in each area  were used to compute the joint probability of areas and types . Empirical distributions were smoothed by adding one to the counts before normalization. The pointwise mutual information (PMI) between areas and types was then computed asThe PMI quantifies how much the actual probability of observing a neuron of a particular type in a particular area differs from a case in which the type and area distributions are statistically independent. A positive PMI means that the combination of area and type is over-represented, and a negative PMI means it is under-represented in the data. To test whether PMI-values were significantly different from zero, PMI values were recomputed 104 times using hierarchically resampled data, and a p value was computed for each PMI value as the fraction of resampled values greater than or less than zero, whichever was smaller. The significance threshold \u03b1 was adjusted to account for multiple comparisons by controlling the false-discovery rate at 0.01 using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure as described above. 64 of 500 PMI values were significantly less than zero and 5 were significantly greater. The shuffle distribution in Figures 5C and 5D was computed by randomly shuffling the type labels of the neurons to break the relationship between\u00a0encoding type and location in cortex.  For the reward-aligned activity maps (Figure\u00a06A), fluorescence activity of all sources was grouped into 1\u00a0s long bins based on reward times. Data in each bin were averaged, and maps across cortex were computed for each bin using a Gaussian smoothing kernel (0.3\u00a0mm s.d.). When relating neural activity to task variables, it is essential to consider correlations between task variables to avoid inferring a relationship between neural activity and a task variable when the activity actually depends on a different, but correlated, variable. We therefore took a conservative approach based on nested models. Our approach identified how much additional explanatory power\u00a0about the neural activity a variable contributed after all other variables had been accounted for. Concretely, for the maps in Figure\u00a06B, we fit a full model including all variables and reported how much more deviance it explained than models lacking one of the variables (see section Reduced models). As with the maps of task factor weights in Figure\u00a02, we used cross-validation to determine\u00a0the amount of smoothing for the encoding maps to ensure that the observed structure was consistent across mice. For the \u201cFull model\u201d map (Figure\u00a06B, left), all recorded neurons were included. For the single-variable maps, only well-fit sources (CNN deviance explained > 0.1) were included. To relate encoding to spread in cortex (Figure\u00a07), neurons were grouped by encoding type as defined for Figure\u00a03. The spread of neurons across cortex within each type was quantified as the area of the ellipse described by the 1 s.d. contour of a Gaussian distribution fit to the cortical location of the sources. The y axis shows the fraction of deviance uniquely attributable to each variable\u00a0(see section \u201cReduced models\u201d), averaged within each encoding type. Confidence intervals (5th and 95th percentile, only displayed for the top three types) were computed by hierarchical bootstrap (104 iterations). Types whose confidence interval did not include zero were considered significant (plotted in black); non-significant points were plotted in gray. Regression lines were computed by fitting a\u00a0simple linear regression to the hierarchically resampled datasets; shaded area indicates 5th and 95th percentile of the resulting distribution of lines. The significance of regression slopes was tested using the two-tailed bootstrap p value defined above. To test whether task-relevant information was present in local populations, we built a decoder that estimated the probability distribution over each task variable at each time point, given the recorded neural responses. The core of the decoder was an encoding model that took the form of a generalized linear model (GLM). The GLM was fit to the fluorescence activity of every source independently and estimated the probability of the neural response, given the task variables. Manual feature selection was used instead of the CNN feature extractor because our goal was to test where task variables were represented in disentangled representations. The ability\u00a0of the CNN to transform and combine input variables nonlinearly would have confounded this analysis. The GLM predicted the deconvolved fluorescence activity  aswhere  is a static pointwise nonlinearity for feature , parametrized as a weighted sum of 16 raised cosine \u201cbumps\u201d:with each  given byThe basis function centers  were chosen such that they covered the range of the feature and were spaced by . (, ).     In addition to the nine variables used in the CNN, the inputs to the GLM used here included the following variables because their untangled representation across cortex was of interest: linear and angular drift, multiplicative interaction terms (linear ball velocity \u00d7 linear screen velocity and angular ball velocity \u00d7 angular screen velocity), and linear and angular acceleration. To measure acceleration at behaviorally relevant timescales, the velocity traces were smoothed (Gaussian window, 100\u00a0ms s. d.). Acceleration was defined as the difference between the current time point and the next in the smoothed trace. As in the CNN-based model, the prediction based on the separately fitted visual receptive field estimate was supplied as a separate feature to the model. This feature did not undergo the raised cosine basis expansion. The model was implemented in TensorFlow and fit using batch gradient descent (Adam optimizer; learning rate, 0.001; \u03b21, 0.8; \u03b22, 0.9). Like the CNN-based model, the model was trained to minimize a loss function based on the Poisson likelihood. To prevent overfitting, the following penalty was added to the loss function:where  is a parameter to tune regularization strength,  is the vector of basis function weights for task feature , and  is the second derivative matrix (a matrix with values 2 and \u22121 on the main an off-diagonals, respectively). The first term encouraged smoothness in the feature nonlinearities by placing a Gaussian prior on the parameters for each nonlinearity (). The second term adds a group lasso penalty that encourages sparsity on the level of task variables (). Together with the first term, this results in an elastic net penalty (), which prevents model degeneracy for variables that are correlated or linearly dependent (e.g., linear velocity, angular velocity, and drift) while also encouraging sparsity. The regularization strength \u00a0was optimized for each neuron by fitting separate models for a series of 50 -values logarithmically spaced between 10\u22128 and\u00a010\u22121. For the final model, the largest (most regularizing)  was chosen that yielded a fraction of deviance explained that was within\u00a00.01 of the best model, on a held-out dataset (20% of the data).  To measure the information about task variables that was decodable from different parts of cortex, we first grouped neurons into\u00a0small local populations. Each population contained approximately 50 nearby neurons that were recorded simultaneously. Populations were chosen by evenly tiling the cortical space covered in a recording session with points (\u201cpopulation centers\u201d), and then assigning neurons to the nearest center. The number of centers per session was chosen to result in approximately 50 neurons per population. Each neuron belonged to exactly one population and populations covered non-overlapping regions of cortex. To decode the value of a task variable, given the local population activity, we used the encoding model (GLM) to estimate the probability of the population responses, given the task variables, and then inverted the model according to Bayes theorem. This approach allowed us to isolate the information contained in the neural activity about a specific task variable, while accounting for information about other, correlated, task variables. Let  be the decoded task variable and  the other task variables (both  and  are parametrized in the GLM in terms of the cosine basis functions). The probability of observing the response  of neuron  can be written as . For each decoded task variable, at each time point in the test set, we used the GLM fitted on the training set to compute  for a range of 20 values for  linearly spaced between the minimum and maximum of  in the training set. Assuming fluorescence\u00a0responses to be conditionally independent given the task variables, we then computed the probability of observing the population activity  as follows:Using Bayes\u2019 rule, we obtained a quantity , which is proportional to the posterior probability  of observing each of the 20 tested values of , as , where  were the true values that were observed for the other task variables. We modeled  as a Gaussian mixture (sklearn.mixture.GaussianMixture with five components, each with its own full covariance parameters) that was fitted to the training data. When decoding the drift variables, we did not include screen velocity in the prior model because this would have led to a degeneracy (drift is a linear combination of ball and screen velocity). As the decoded value of , we used its expected value .  Our goal was to assess how much information about the task variable was present in the neural activity. To assess decoding accuracy,\u00a0we therefore first computed , the sum of squared errors between the true task variable and the decoding estimate.  contained contributions from the correlations between the decoded task variable  and the other variables  in addition to the information provided by the neural responses. To isolate the contribution of the neural response, we computed , where  was the sum of squared errors between the true task variable and a decoding estimate based only on the relationship between the decoded variable and the other variables, , without any neural information. We then computed\u00a0the fraction of variance explained by the neural responses as , where  was the sum of squares of the\u00a0decoded task variable. Maps of decoding accuracy (Figure\u00a08) were computed by assigning each neuron the decoding performance of the population that this source was a member of, and then applying cross-validated Gaussian smoothing as described above. To provide a notion of the uncertainty of the estimate of decoding accuracy, for the maps, we reported the accuracy in units\u00a0of standard errors above zero. The standard error was computed from the average variance of decoding performance at each pixel in the map, based on the maps from  mice. For the open-loop analysis (Figure\u00a08D), an encoding model was fit to all time points except the open-loop time points and those closed-loop time points that were replayed during the open-loop segments. This model was then used to decode the task variables at open-loop time points (for the maps and the \u201cOpen loop\u201d points in Figure\u00a08D) and at the replayed closed-loop time points (for the \u201cClosed loop\u201d points). The error bars show 5th and 95th percentile confidence intervals of the mean across neurons (hierarchical bootstrap).

Our results demonstrate the importance of the spatial positioning of neural progenitors in cortical development and reveal a mechanism underlying the establishment of the SVZ microenvironment.  Spatiotemporal control of neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation is essential for the production of the proper number of neurons in the brain. In the developing mouse brain, neurogenesis begins around embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) and reaches a peak between E13.5 and E14.5 (). Cortical neurons are generated from two major types of progenitor cells: radial glial progenitors (RGPs) and intermediate progenitors (IPs) (, ). RGPs are highly polarized and their processes extend from the apical ventricular surface to the basal pial surface. However, the cell bodies of RGPs are retained within the ventricular zone (VZ) adjacent to the ventricular surface. RGPs undergo either symmetric divisions to expand the progenitor pool or asymmetric divisions to generate neurons or IPs (). While differentiated neurons migrate into the cortical plate along the basal processes of RGPs, IPs migrate away from the VZ to form the subventricular zone (SVZ) at the basal side of the VZ, where they undergo limited rounds of symmetric divisions that amplify the neuron production (). Neurons derived from IPs contribute to all cortical layers during brain development (, , ). Perturbation of proliferation or differentiation of RGPs or IPs leads to abnormal neuron production, which causes cortical malfunctions (, ). RGPs are maintained within the VZ through anchoring of their apical endfeet via adherens junctions (, ). Disruption of apical adherens junctions through the ablation of the apical polarity proteins (, ) or adhesion molecules (, ) in RGPs leads to the disruption of the VZ integrity. In turn, this disruption results in the generation of ectopic neurons, which leads to disorganized cortical lamination such as those in periventricular heterotopia and subcortical band heterotopia (, ). In addition, adhesion molecules have also been demonstrated to be important for neuronal migration toward the pial surface (, ). However, the molecular mechanism that regulates the migration of committed IPs to the SVZ remains unknown. Histone deacetylases 1 and 2 (HDAC1 and HDAC2, respectively) are key epigenetic regulators that modify the acetylation levels of core histones to regulate gene expression during development (, ). HDAC activity is associated with both inactive and active genes () and has been shown to be important for lineage specification during T\u00a0cell development in the thymus and for the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (, ). In addition, HDAC2 plays an important role in regulating synaptic plasticity in the adult brain (). However, the roles of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in early brain development, particularly at the onset of neurogenesis, are poorly understood. Here, we conditionally inactivated both HDAC1 and HDAC2 in RGPs at E10.5, when neurogenesis begins, and found that HDAC1 and HDAC2 are essential for the spatial positioning of IPs. Loss of HDAC1 and HDAC2 leads to ectopic positioning of IPs at the VZ surface, where RGPs normally divide. These ectopic IPs divide and differentiate into neurons in the VZ, ultimately disrupting the VZ integrity and the laminar organization of the cortex. Furthermore, we identified the proneural gene Neurogenin 2 (Neurog2) as a key downstream target of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in the regulation of IP migration. These findings reveal that the proper positioning of IPs is essential for the architectural integrity of the cerebral cortex, which is in turn necessary for brain development. To determine the roles of HDAC1 and HDAC2 during early cortical development, we first examined their expression in the developing mouse neocortex. At E12.5, shortly after neuroepithelial progenitors transform into RGPs, HDAC1 and HDAC2 were highly abundant in RGPs positive for Sox2, a neural progenitor marker (Figures 1A, 1B, 1I, and 1J). At this stage, HDAC1 and HDAC2 were also detected in differentiated neurons positive for the neuronal marker Tuj1 (Figures 1A\u20131D and 1I\u20131L). The expression of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in RGPs and neurons persisted until the late stage of neurogenesis (Figures 1E\u20131H and 1M\u20131P). While the expression level of HDAC2 remained largely unchanged during cortical development, the expression level of HDAC1 was gradually reduced over time (Figure\u00a01Q). The higher expression of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in RGPs during embryonic brain development suggests that they might be important for neurogenesis. To identify the potential functions of HDAC1 and HDAC2 at the\u00a0onset of neurogenesis, we conditionally inactivated either HDAC1 or HDAC2 in the developing neocortex by crossing mice with floxed HDAC1 or HDAC2 alleles (HDAC1f/f or HDAC2f/f) () with the Emx1-Cre line. Emx1-Cre drives the expression of Cre recombinase in RGPs and activates at E10.5, when neurogenesis begins (). We did not observe an obvious phenotypic effect on brain development when either HDAC1 or HDAC2 was deleted in RGPs, supporting the functionally redundancy of HDAC1 and HDAC2 (data not shown) (, ). We then generated mice with simultaneous deletion of both HDAC1 and HDAC2 in RGPs (HDAC1f/f;HDAC2f/f;Emx1-Cre, in short, HDAC1/2 conditional knockout [cKO]). HDAC1/2 cKO mice died shortly after birth. Histological analysis revealed that the brain size and the cerebral cortex size in particular were dramatically reduced in HDAC1/2 cKO brains compared to wild-type (WT) brains (Figures 1R and 1S). Immunostaining confirmed the loss of HDAC1 and HDAC2 at E12.5 in HDAC1/2 cKO cortices (Figure\u00a0S1). The reduced cortical size suggested that neocortical development was defective when both HDAC1 and HDAC2 were removed at the onset of neurogenesis. During development, early-born neurons occupy the deep layers of the neocortex, while later-born neurons migrate past these neurons to form the superficial layers in an \u201cinside-out\u201d fashion. Deletion of both HDAC1 and HDAC2 resulted in a significant reduction in cortical thickness in HDAC1/2 cKO brains compared to WT brains (Figures 1T\u20131V compared to Figures 1W\u20131Y). In WT brains, both deep-layer neurons (Tbr1- or Ctip2-positive cells) and superficial layer neurons (Satb2- or Brn2-positive cells) were produced at E16.5 (Figures 1T\u20131V). However, in HDAC1/2 cKO brains, only early-born neurons positive for Tbr1 or Ctip2 were detected, while Satb2- or Brn2-positive late-born neurons were not observed (Figures 1W\u20131Y). Furthermore, these early-born neurons did not form cohesive layers and were distributed throughout the whole cortex of the mutant brains and some were even found at the ventricular surface (Figure\u00a01W). Most of these ectopic neurons were positive for both Tbr1 and Ctip2 (Figure\u00a01W); however, the number of Tbr1-positive cells was lower in HDAC1/2 cKO brains than in WT brains (Figure\u00a01Z). To further demonstrate the defect in the generation of upper-layer neurons in HDAC1/2 cKO brains, we stained sections for Satb2 and Ctip2 at various developmental stages. We did not observe neurons positive for Satb2 (Figures S2A\u2013S2F). In addition, we stained sections for Bhlhb5, which is expressed in layer II-V neurons and colocalizes with Ctip2-positive neurons of layer V (). Although we found some neurons that expressed Bhlhb5 in HDAC1/2 cKO brains, the majority of these cells were positive for Ctip2 (Figures S2G\u2013S2I), suggesting that they were likely early-born neurons. To examine the neuronal fate, we administered bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to mouse embryos at E14.5 and then examined the fate of BrdU positive cells at E16.5. We found that some of BrdU-positive cells were positive for Ctip2 in both WT and HDAC1/2 cKO brains (Figures S2J and S2K). Interestingly, we found that most BrdU-positive cells in HDAC1/2 cKO brains were also positive for the progenitor marker Pax6 (Figures S2L\u2013S2N), suggesting that these cells were proliferative progenitors. Taken together, the results suggest that loss of HDAC1 and HDAC2 leads to defective generation of later-born neurons and abnormal cortical lamination. To determine whether the disorganization of the cortex was due to the depletion of the progenitors, we examined the neural progenitor pool by immunostaining for Pax6. At E12.5, shortly after Emx1-Cre activation, we observed a reduction in the progenitor pool in HDAC1/2 cKO brains by analyzing the thickness of the VZ, which was composed of Pax6-positive RGPs (Figures 2A and 2D and 2G). In WT brains, the population of progenitors was gradually decreased during cortical development as these progenitors differentiated into neurons (Figures 2A\u20132C). Strikingly, Pax6-positive progenitors occupied nearly the whole cortex, although the number of progenitors was lower in HDAC1/2 cKO brains than in WT brains (Figures 2D\u20132F). To further confirm the reduction in the progenitor pool, we examined the number of mitotic progenitors that were marked by phospho-Histone H3 (PH3). Indeed, the number of mitotic progenitors was significantly lower in HDAC1/2 cKO brains than in WT brains (Figures 2H\u20132J). Previous studies have demonstrated that depletion of both HDAC1 and HDAC2 results in apoptosis at the late stage of brain development (). Consistent with these data, staining for activated caspase-3 revealed a small fraction of RGPs undergoing cell death in HDAC1/2 cKO brains (Figures S3A\u2013S3D). Deacetylation of p53, a tumor suppressor, by HDAC is associated with the increases in cell apoptosis (, ). We next determined whether the cell death induced by the loss of HDAC1 and HDAC2 depends on p53. When p53 was deleted in the HDAC1/2 double mutant background at E12.5, the number of cells positive for caspase-3 was reduced (Figures S3E\u2013S3G), suggesting that HDAC1/2-mediated apoptosis is, at least in part, p53 dependent. Consistent with previous results (Figures 2A\u20132J), the number of proliferating RGPs was reduced when p53 was deleted in the HDAC1/2 double-mutant background (Figures S3H\u2013S3J), and the cell cycle exit rate was increased (Figure\u00a0S3K). Thus, HDAC1 and HDAC2 are required for maintenance of the progenitor pool at the onset of neurogenesis. RGPs undergo interkinetic nuclear migration (INM) during cell cycle progression, which can influence the fate of the RGP progeny (). We wanted to determine whether the INM was affected by the loss of HDAC1 and HDAC2. After mitosis at the apical surface, the nuclei of RGPs move basally during the G1 phase to the basal side of the VZ, where S phase takes place, and then migrate back to the apical side during the G2 phase. We administered BrdU to mouse embryos at E12.5 and examined brain sections 30\u00a0min and 3\u00a0hr later, which allows us to label cells in the S phase and the S-G2 phase, respectively. After 30\u00a0min, most BrdU-labeled nuclei were located on the basal side of the VZ in both WT and HDAC1/2 cKO cortices (Figures 2K\u20132M), suggesting a normal basal movement. Within 3\u00a0hr, BrdU-labeled nuclei in HDAC1/2 cKO cortices had moved apically, while a slight increase in labeled nuclei at the apical side was observed (Figures 2N\u20132P). Together, these data suggest that the INM of RGPs is largely unaffected upon the loss of HDAC1 and HDAC2. IPs amplify the production of neurons during neocortical development (). We next investigated whether the IP lineage was affected by the loss of HDAC1 and HDAC2. At the onset of neurogenesis, IPs derived from RGPs migrate away from the ventricular surface to the SVZ, where they differentiate into neurons. Unlike RGPs, IPs express a specific transcription factor called Tbr2 (also known as Eomes) (). In WT brains, most Tbr2-positive IPs were located in the SVZ, while few migrating IPs were observed in the VZ (Figures 3A and 3B). Surprisingly, at E12.5, a population of IPs was located at the VZ surface in HDAC1/2 cKO brains (Figure\u00a03C). This phenotype was even stronger at E13.5, when the rate of neurogenesis increased (Figure\u00a03D). Statistical analysis of the position of the IPs relative to the VZ surface clearly demonstrated that an additional layer of IPs was generated at the VZ surface in HDAC1/2 cKO brains (Figure\u00a03E). The number of Tbr2-positive IPs was not different between HDAC1/2 cKO brains and WT brains at E12.5 (Figure\u00a03F). However, the number of Tbr2-positive IPs was reduced in HDAC1/2 cKO brains at E13.5 (Figure\u00a03F). To further demonstrate the ectopic localization of IPs at the VZ surface, we performed whole-mount cortical staining (Figure\u00a03G). The en face view showed that a large number of Tbr2-positive IPs were located at the ventricular surface in HDAC1/2 cKO brains (Figure\u00a03I). To further confirm the identity of these apical IPs, we first examined the expression of Pax6 and Sox2, both of which are markers for RGPs, in Tbr2-positive IPs (Figure\u00a0S4). We found that the number of Pax6 and Tbr2 double-positive cells was lower in HDAC1/2 cKO brains than in WT brains (Figures S4A\u2013S4C). Similarly, the number of Sox2 and Tbr2 double-positive cells was also lower in HDAC1/2 cKO brains than in WT brains (Figures S4G\u2013S4I). Furthermore, the majority of apical Tbr2-positive IPs were not positive for either Pax6 or Sox2 (Figures S4D and S4J), suggesting that these ectopic IPs do not express RGP markers. Additionally, we performed in situ hybridization for Svet1 and Lmo4, which are known to be expressed in IPs (). Unlike in WT brains, ectopic IPs expressing Svet1 and Lmo4 were detected at the VZ surface in HDAC1/2 cKO brains (Figure\u00a0S5). Thus, these data demonstrate that IPs are mislocalized to the VZ upon the loss of HDAC1 and HDAC2. The basal processes of RGPs provide the scaffold by which IPs migrate to the SVZ (). We next examined whether the integrity of the basal processes of RGPs was disrupted by the depletion of HDAC1/2. When stained, the sections for Nestin, an intermediate filament protein expressed by RGPs, we did not observe a disruption of basal processes (Figures 3J\u20133M), suggesting that the defect in IP migration was independent of RGPs basal processes. In addition, we observed the ectopic IPs at the VZ surface in p53, HDAC1 and HDAC2 triple mutant brains in which cells undergoing apoptosis were nearly undetectable (Figures S3L and S3M), suggesting that the abnormal migration of\u00a0IPs in HDAC1/2 cKO brains was not caused by the increased cell death. Taken together, our data indicate that HDAC1 and HDAC2 are essential for proper positioning of IPs in neocortical development. We next examined how apical IPs are dynamically mispositioned in the VZ. To this end, we developed two assays to analyze the apical IP positioning (Figure\u00a04). First, we took advantage of the neural progenitor positioning, which is a dynamic process during the cell cycle progression in the VZ (Figures 2K\u20132P) (). The positions of progenitors were examined by tracking BrdU-labeled progenitor cells at different phases of the cell cycle following BrdU administration at the S phase (, ). BrdU was administered to E12.5 embryos, and the cortices were analyzed 8\u00a0hr and 14\u00a0hr later, which corresponded to labeling of the cells at the early G1 phase and the late G1 phase, respectively, when progenitor cells migrate basally (Figures 4A and 4B). We then analyzed the positions of IPs positive for both Tbr2 and BrdU in the VZ. We found that BrdU-labeled IPs migrated basally to the SVZ at the late G1 phase in the WT cortices (Figures 4A and 4C\u20134E). In contrast, BrdU-labeled IPs did not migrate to the SVZ in the HDAC1/2 cKO cortices and accumulated in the VZ (Figures 4B and 4C\u20134E), suggesting dysfunction of IP migration upon the loss of HDAC1 and 2. Furthermore, to directly visualize the cell migration, we established time-lapse imaging after in utero electroporation in brain slices (Figure\u00a04F). In this assay, migration of RGP daughter cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) in slices was tracked with time-lapse imaging. Consistent with the results of the BrdU tracking experiments, we found that daughter cells with bipolar morphology of WT RGPs migrated basally after division (Figure\u00a04G). In contrast, daughter cells of mutant RGPs (54.5%, 6/11) accumulated at the VZ (Figure\u00a04H), indicating dysfunctional migration. As the daughter cells of mutant RGPs had a non-bipolar morphology typical of IPs, these results suggest that HDAC1 and HDAC2 are essential for basal migration of IPs. To examine the functional impact of ectopic IPs in cortical development, we first analyzed their differentiation potential. Normally, IPs of the SVZ divide basally, in contrast to RGPs, which divide at the apical ventricular surface (). In\u00a0WT brains, RGPs divided apically and IPs divided basally, as\u00a0revealed by immunostaining for phosphorylated vimentin (pVim), a mitotic marker (Figures 5A\u20135D). Like the RGPs of WT brains, the RGPs of HDAC1/2 cKO brains also divided at the apical ventricular surface (Figures 5E\u20135H). Surprisingly, we found that apically localized IPs also colocalized with pVim and divided at the apical surface (Figures 5E, 5F, 5H, and 5I), suggesting that these IPs were mitotically active. This was further confirmed by costaining with anti-PH3, which marks mitotic cells (Figures S4E and S4F). When we labeled cycling progenitors through BrdU incorporation at E12.5 and stained for the proliferation marker Ki67 24 hours later, we found that more IPs exited the cell cycle in HDAC1/2 cKO brains than in WT brains (Figures 5J\u20135L). In particular, many apical IPs were BrdU-positive but Ki67 negative, suggesting that they were prone to differentiate into neurons (Figure\u00a05L). Indeed, the majority of the apical IPs in HDAC1/2 cKO brains were positive for the immature neuronal marker Tuj1 at E12.5, suggesting that these IPs were differentiating into neurons (Figures 5M\u20135P). When neurons become mature, they express the transcription factor Tbr1 (). We found that mature neurons generated from apical IPs were positive for Tbr1 and were located at the apical surface in HDAC1/2 cKO brains (Figure\u00a05R), while Tbr1-positive neurons were located primarily in the cortical plate in WT brains (Figure\u00a05Q). However, the number of Tbr1-positive neurons was lower in HDAC1/2 cKO brains than in WT brains (Figure\u00a05S). Taken together, our data demonstrate that apical IPs adopt the VZ microenvironment and differentiate into neurons at the apical ventricular surface. To determine whether HDAC1 and HDAC2 temporally regulate the IP positioning during neocortical development, we used a\u00a0tamoxifen-inducible Sox2-Cre ERT2 system to inactivate HDAC1 and HDAC2 in RGPs at E10.5, when neurogenesis begins, and a later stage at E13.5, the peak of neurogenesis (Figure\u00a06). Immunostaining confirmed the loss of both HDAC1 and HDAC2 at E13.5 and E16.5, 3\u00a0days after tamoxifen administration (Figures 6A\u20136E and 6L\u20136P). We observed reduced cortical thickness when HDAC1 and HDAC2 were inactivated at either the early (E10.5) or late embryonic stage (E13.5) (Figures S6A and S6B). We also observed that IPs ectopically localized at the VZ surface in HDAC1/2-induced conditional knockout brains (HDAC1/2 icKO) when HDAC1 and HDAC2 were inactivated at E10.5 (Figures 6F\u20136I). In addition, the number of Tbr2-positive IPs was reduced, and the majority of IPs were not positive for the RGP marker Pax6 (Figures 6J and 6K), which is consistent with the results obtained after Emx1Cre-mediated depletion of HDAC1 and HDAC2 at the early embryonic stage. In contrast, when HDAC1 and HDAC2 were inactivated at E13.5, IPs in both WT and HDAC1/2 icKO brains were located in the SVZ (Figures 6Q\u20136T), suggesting that migration of IPs to the SVZ at the later stage is not dependent on HDAC1 and HDAC2. Interestingly, we also observed proper localization of upper-layer neurons in HDAC1/2 icKO brains when HDAC1 and HDAC2 were depleted at the late stage (Figure\u00a0S6C). Together, these data suggest that IP positioning is temporally regulated by HDAC1 and HDAC2 during neocortical development. Downregulation of cadherin adhesions and polarity proteins is a hallmark of IPs (). To investigate whether ectopic IPs at the VZ surface may potentially disrupt its integrity, we stained sections for N-cadherin. At E12.5, the apical adherens junctions were intact in HDAC1/2 cKO brains (Figures 7A and 7B). However, we found that the apical adherens junctions in HDAC1/2 cKO brains were severely disrupted with many cells displaced in the ventricle at E14.5 (Figures 7C and 7D). This was further confirmed by the staining for Arl13b, a marker of primary cilia (Figures 7E and 7F), which are normally carried by RGPs and protruded into the ventricle (). When viewed from the apical side (Figure\u00a07G), N-cadherin staining showed a characteristic honeycomb pattern of adherens junctions in WT brains (Figure\u00a07H). In HDAC1/2-deficient brains, however, we found disruption of adherens junctions where IPs were localized to the apical surface (Figure\u00a07I), suggesting that apical localization of IPs is correlated with the disruption of apical adherens junctions. To further confirm this, we examined the adherens junctions in HDAC1/2 icKO brains. When depletion of HDAC1 and HDAC2 was induced at E10.5, the adherens junctions appeared disrupted compared to these in WT brains (Figure\u00a0S6D). However, ventricular integrity was maintained when depletion of HDAC1, and HDAC2 was induced at E13.5 (Figure\u00a0S6E). Thus, these results indicate that excessive production of IPs at the apical surface disrupts the apical ventricular structure, which may affect neural progenitor behaviors. Indeed, we found that neural progenitors formed rosette-like structures within the cortex in HDAC1/2 cKO brains that were similar to the Homer Wright rosettes found in the primitive neuroectodermal tumors (Figures 7J\u20137Q). These structures were observed only when the depletion of HDAC1 and HDAC2 was induced at the early stage (Figures S6D and S6E). Within these structures, some of neural progenitors differentiated into neurons that were positive for the immature neuronal marker Tuj1 and occupied almost the whole cortex (Figures 7L and 7P). To further examine the differentiation potential of RGPs within the rosette structures, we pulsed animals with BrdU at E14.5 and analyzed them 2\u00a0days later. We found that the majority of BrdU-positive cells were also positive for the progenitor marker Pax6 in HDAC1/2 cKO brains, while very few double-positive cells were present in the control littermates (Figures 7R and 7S), suggesting that the majority of RGPs within rosettes are proliferative. These progenitors were also positive for PH3 and Ki67 (Figure\u00a0S7), further supporting their proliferative potential. This potentially explains the lack of late-born neurons in cortical development and the further cortical malformation (Figures 1X and 1Y) in HDAC1/2 cKO brains. Cell death can potentially lead to the disturbance of apical adhesions, which may contribute to the rosette formation (). Therefore, we examined the apical surface integrity and the rosette formation in HDAC1/2/p53 triple knockouts in which cell death was minimized (Figure\u00a0S8). Similar to the findings in HDAC1/2 cKO cortices, the apical surface was disrupted at E14.5 in the triple-knockout cortices (Figures S8A\u2013S8H). Rosette formation was initiated at E14.5 and rosette structures were clearly visible at E15.5 in HDAC1/2/p53 triple mutant cortices (Figures S8I\u2013S8P), suggesting that cell death was not a cause of the rosette formation upon the loss of HDAC1 and HDAC2. Taken together, these results indicate that ectopic accumulation of IPs at the VZ surface leads to disruption of the apical structure and therefore to cortical malformation. To further investigate the mechanisms by which HDAC1 and HDAC2 regulate the positioning of IPs in cortical development, we performed global transcriptome analysis of neocortex tissue collected from both WT and HDAC1/2 cKO brains at E12.5. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that the expression of the majority of genes were not changed upon the depletion of HDAC1 and HDAC2 (Figures S9A and S9B; GEO: GSE122834). However, we did identify both upregulated and downregulated genes (Figure\u00a0S9C), suggesting that HDAC1 and HDAC2 may regulate the transcription of both active and inactive genes (). Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed enrichments for transcription and chromatin modification (Figure\u00a0S9D). When we analyzed proneural genes that are expressed in the IP lineage, we found that Neurog2 was downregulated, as\u00a0confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) (Figure\u00a08A) and immunostaining (Figures 8B and 8C). To determine whether Neurog2 is directly regulated by HDAC1 or HDAC2, we performed site-directed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments with antibodies specific for HDAC1 at different regions\u00a0of the Neurog2 gene locus (Figure\u00a08D). qPCR analysis showed that HDAC1 was associated with the promoter and coding regions of Neurog2 (Figure\u00a08D). In addition, we also examined the histone acetylation and methylation status at the promoter of Neurog2. We found that both histone H3K9 acetylation (H3K9ac) and histone H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) were associated with Neurog2 promoter regions. Interestingly, H3K27me3 levels were elevated in HDAC1/2 mutants, which is associated with gene repression (Figure\u00a08D). We hypothesized that the expression level of Neurog2 is regulated by HDAC1/2-mediated histone acetylation, which can further recruit additional epigenetic regulators to the promoter regions to control Neurog2 transcription. However, the exact underlying mechanisms need further investigation. Taken together, these data suggest that Neurog2 might be a key downstream effector that regulates IP positioning. To address whether Neurog2 plays a role in regulating IP migration, we investigated whether forced expression of Neurog2 in\u00a0HDAC1/HDAC2-deficient progenitors could attenuate the migration defect of IPs. We used the tamoxifen-inducible system to inactivate HDAC1 and HDAC2 at E12.5 and then electroporated constructs expressing Neurog2 into RGPs in utero at E13.5. The electroporated brains were analyzed at E15.5 (Figure\u00a08E). In WT brains, GFP-labeled Tbr2-positive IPs were located in the SVZ (Figure\u00a08F), while depletion of HDAC1 and HDAC2 led to the ectopic positioning of IPs at the VZ surface (Figure\u00a08G). Importantly, the expression of Neurog2 in HDAC1- and HDAC2-mutant cells resulted in a marked attenuation of the migration defect (Figures 8H and 8J). Similarly, re-expression of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in HDAC1- and HDAC2-mutant cells was also attenuated the abnormal positioning of IPs (Figures 8I and 8J). In addition, downregulation of Neurog2 by shRNAs also led to abnormal IP positioning (Figures S10A and S10B). We next examined whether the expression of Neurog2 in HDAC1- and HDAC2-mutant cells could also attenuate the observed premature cell cycle exit. We quantified the number of cells that exited the cell cycle and found that expression of Neurog2 indeed attenuated premature cell cycle exit (Figure\u00a0S10C). Taken together, these data suggest that Neurog2 is an essential downstream effector of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in the regulation of the proper positioning of IPs. Spatiotemporal control of neuron production is essential for the functional integrity of the neocortex. IPs of the SVZ in the developing mouse brain produce neurons for all cortical layers and ultimately determine brain size. Here, we show that HDAC1 and HDAC2 regulate the migration of IPs to the SVZ, at least in part, by promoting Neurog2 expression. Deletion of both HDAC1 and HDAC2 at the onset of neurogenesis leads to mispositioning of IPs at the VZ surface, where RGPs normally undergo mitosis. These ectopic IPs can divide and differentiate into neurons at the VZ surface, suggesting that differentiation of IPs can occur outside the SVZ. The increase in IPs at the VZ surface disrupts the VZ integrity, which further leads to the formation of rosette-like structures in which neural progenitors continue to proliferate. Ultimately, the architectural integrity of the cortex is disrupted. Thus, our data demonstrate that proper positioning of IPs is essential for the maintenance of cortical integrity. The maintenance of stem cells within their microenvironment is essential for determination of the fates of their progeny and ultimately for tissue homeostasis (, ). In the developing mammalian brain, RGPs of the VZ and IPs of the SVZ are distinct types of progenitors with different proliferative capacities. RGPs can undergo multiple rounds of divisions to generate most cortical neurons as well as astrocyte (), while IPs have limited proliferative capacity and can generate only cortical neurons (, ). The basal processes of RGPs provide the scaffolds for neuronal and IP migration. However, we found that the basal processes of RGPs are intact in HDAC1/2 cKO brains, suggesting that the abnormal IP positioning is independent of these processes of RGPs. It seems that the migration of differentiated neurons from these ectopic IPs is also independent of basal processes as differentiated neurons accumulated at the VZ surface. Therefore, our data suggest that proper positioning of IPs in the SVZ may also be important for the migration of neurons differentiated from IPs. The maintenance of ventricular integrity is essential for RGP proliferation and differentiation (, ). Downregulation of adhesion proteins and loss of polarity proteins is a key feature of IPs. Reorganization of adherens junctions in the ectopically positioned IPs at the VZ surface may lead to the disruption of apical VZ integrity, although the exact mechanism remains to be resolved. We reason that adhesion molecules might not be directly regulated by HDAC1 and HDAC2, as the adherens junctions were intact at E12.5 when HDAC1 and HDAC2 were completely knocked out. In addition, removal of adhesion proteins, such as Lgl1, E-catenin, and N-cadherin, in neural progenitors in early brain development leads to immediate disruption of apical junctions at the time when these proteins were removed (, , ), suggesting an immediate effect of the loss of adhesion molecules. Epigenetic regulators play crucial roles in regulating the expression of key factors in neural stem cells to balance their proliferation and differentiation both spatially and temporally (, ). HDAC1 and HDAC2 have previously been shown to regulate neural stem cell differentiation in studies investigating their removal in late stages of brain development (, ). We also found that the removal of both HDAC1 and HDAC2 led to the depletion of the progenitor pool, suggesting that HDAC1 and\u00a0HDAC2 play similar roles in regulating neural progenitor differentiation. However, loss of HDAC1 and HDAC2 has stronger effects on Tbr2-positive IPs at early developmental stages than at later stages and leads to ectopic positioning at the VZ surface. Together with the findings of a previous study in which HDAC1/2 was removed through hGFAP-Cre-mediated recombination around E13.5, the peak of neurogenesis (), our findings suggest a model in which two different stages for the role of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in neocortical development can be distinguished. When HDAC1/2 is depleted in early stages of brain development (between E10.5 and E12.5, at the onset of neurogenesis), IPs are ectopically localized in the VZ, ultimately contributing to cortical malformation. During the peak of neurogenesis, depletion of HDAC1/2 also leads to cortical malformation that is attributed to defects in RGP differentiation defects (). This is consistent with our findings (Figure\u00a06): when HDAC1/2 was depleted through the tamoxifen-induced Cre activation system at E10.5, we observed ectopic Tbr2-positive IPs in the VZ. However, when HDAC1/2 was depleted at E13.5, the positioning of IPs was normal, although the thickness of the cortex was reduced. Therefore, the relative contributions of RGPs versus IPs to the neocortical development are dependent on developmental stage. This phenomenon is probably due to the temporal regulation of gene expression exerted by HDAC1- and HDAC2-mediated histone modification during cortical development. Indeed, previous studies have shown that the chromatin in neural stem cells becomes more condensed and less dynamic during neocortical development (), suggesting that epigenetic regulators could play important roles during this developmental period through temporal and spatial regulation of the expression of specific gene sets. As a key downstream effector, Neurog2 plays an important role in regulating IP positioning. In contrast to a previous study showing the role of Neurog2 in regulating neuronal migration through phosphorylation (), we show that regulation of Neurog2 expression by HDAC1 and HDAC2 is important for the temporal regulation of IP positioning. Taken together, our findings suggest that proper positioning of progenitor cells in their microenvironment is essential for neocortical development and provides a link between neural progenitor positioning, particularly that of IPs, and the neocortical malformation. In the human cortex, outer radial glia (oRG) cells located in the outer SVZ are abundant and are essential for cortical expansion (). In the future, it will be of great interest to examine the importance of the positioning of oRG cells in brain development.

Homozygous HDAC1f/f;HDAC2f/f mice () were crossed with Emx1-Cre mice () to generate HDAC1f/+;HDAC2f/+;Emx1-Cre mice, which were further crossed with HDAC1f/f;HDAC2f/f mice to generate double conditional knockout mice (HDAC1/2 cKO). For tamoxifen-inducible deletion of HDAC1 and HDAC2, Sox2-CreERT2 mice were used (). For analyzing p53 dependent cell death in HDAC1/2 cKO, P53f/f mice () were used to cross with HDAC1f/f;HDAC2f/f mice to generate HDAC1f/f;HDAC2f/f; P53f/f mice. For all experiments, both male and female littermates were randomly assigned to experimental groups. E12.5 to E18.5 mouse embryos obtained from timely pregnant female were used for experiments. For comparison of the size of the cortical areas between WT and HDAC1/2 cKO brains, P0 mouse pups were used. All animal work was approved by Animal Care and Use Committee of Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University. Following dissection, embryonic brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight at 4\u00b0C, and then transferred to 30% sucrose in PBS until brains sunk to the bottom of the tube. Brains were then embedded in O.C.T compound (Sakura). Brains were sectioned into 14-\u03bcm thickness. Cryosections were permeabilized and incubated with blocking solution (0.1% Triton X-100, 5% normal goat serum in PBS) for 1 hour at room temperature. After incubation with the primary antibody at 4\u00b0C overnight, sections were washed with PBS and incubated with appropriate fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1\u00a0hour before mounting. Primary antibodies are listed in Key Resources Table. Tamoxifen (Sigma, T5648) was dissolved in corn oil (20mg/mL) at room temperature under constant stirring. Timely pregnant females were given intraperitoneal injection of tamoxifen (190\u00a0\u03bcg/g of body weight). Embryonic brains were analyzed 2-3\u00a0days later. IUE was performed according to a previous study (). Timely pregnant mice were anesthetized and uterine horns were exposed. Desired plasmids (1.5\u03bcg/\u03bcL) were injected into the lateral ventricle of embryos. For electroporation, five 50ms pulses of 28-35V dependent on the embryonic age with 950ms interval were applied with a BTX electroporation system (ECM830). After the electroporation, uterine horns were placed back to the abdominal cavity and the wound was sutured. The embryonic brains were analyzed 2-3\u00a0days later. For time-lapse imaging, IUE was performed at E12.5 and RGPs were labeled with plasmids expressing GFP. Twelve hours after IUE, embryos were removed and the brains were isolated into ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing NaCl (125mM), CaCl2 (2mM), KCl (2.5mM), MgCl (1mM), NaH2PO4 (1.25mM), NaHCO3 (25mM) and Glucose (25\u00a0mM). Brains were embedded in 4% low-melting agarose (Fisher Scientific, BP165-25) in ACSF and sectioned at 300\u03bcm using a vibratome (LEICA VT1200S). Brain slices were then transferred onto a cell culture insert (Millicell, PICMORG50) in a glass-bottom dish (Thermo Scientific, 150682) with medium (by volume) containing HBSS (25%, by volume), BEM (66%), FBS (5%), Penicillin/Streptomycin (1%), N2 supplements (all from Thermo Scientific), and Glucose (6%) (Sigma). Six hours after culturing, dishes with brain slices containing GFP-expressing cells were transferred to an inverted confocal microscope (Nikon ECLIPSE Ti) and time-lapse images were acquired every 30\u00a0min for about 24 hours. Cells expressing GFP that divided during the imaging time were identified for further analysis. In situ hybridization was performed according to a protocol previously published (). E13.5 embryonic brains were fixed with 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C, and dehydrated with 30% sucrose in Diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated PBS until brains sunk. Brains were embedded in OCT and sectioned with a thickness of 20\u00a0\u03bcm. Digoxigenin (DIG) labeled RNA probes were made by in\u00a0vitro transcription using DIG RNA labeling mix (Roche, 11277073910). Sections were incubated with probes at 65\u00b0C overnight. After washing with the hybridization buffer, sections were incubated with anti-DIG-AP (Roche, 11093274910) at 4\u00b0C overnight. The AP activity was developed using NBT/BCIP substrates (Roche, 11681451001). The following primers were used to generate probes: Lmo4: Fwd 5\u2032- CCCAAGCTTGACCCACAGCCCTCATCAAT, Rev 5\u2032- GCTCTAGACTTTGTCATGGGCGGAGCAA; Svet1: Fwd 5\u2032- CCCAAGCTTTGGTCTAGGAAGGGGGAGGA, Rev 5\u2032- GCTCTAGAGTAATGGTGCCAAGCAGAAGC; Images were taken by confocal microscopy (Nikon A1R). All images were processed using NIS-Elements AR (Nikon) or Adobe Photoshop CS 6.0. For cell distribution analysis, the dorsal cortex was divided into 10 bins evenly and the apical side was numbered as 1 and the basal side as 10. The number of cells distributed in each bin was manually counted using NIS-Elements AR (Nikon). Embryonic cortices (E13.5) were dissociated, and approximately 1\u00a0\u00d7 107 cells were used for chromatin immunoprecipitation. Dissociated cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde (F8775, Sigma) for 10min at room temperature. Glycine (2.5M) was used to terminate the cross-linking. After washing with cold PBS, cells were lysed on ice for 10min with lysis buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 10mM EDTA pH8.0, 0.1% SDS) containing the protease inhibitor (Cat. No.88666, ThermoScientific). Then samples were sonicated using the Bioruptor Pico (Diagenode). After sonication, the supernatant was collected and incubated with either Rabbit IgG (2729, Cell Signaling) or primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight. After the antibody incubation, protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz, SC-2003) were added into the supernatant and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 4 hours. After washing, DNA was eluted with the elution buffer (1% SDS, 50mM Tris pH8.0, 10mM EDTA). The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-HDAC1 (Abcam, ab7028), rabbit anti-H3K27me3 (ABclonal, A2363) and rabbit anti-H3K9ac (Millipore, 06-942). The following primers were used for real-time q-PCR analysis: Primer pairs 1: Fwd1: 5\u2032-AGAGTGATCCACTCGCTCCT, Rev1: 5\u2032-CGCCTTGACGTAATTTGGGG; Primer pairs 2: Fwd2: 5\u2032-CAACTCCACGTCCCCATACA; Rev2: 5\u2032-CAGGTGAGGCGCATAACGAT; Total RNA was extracted from both WT and HDAC1/2 cKO cerebral cortex using TRIzol reagent (ThermoScientific) and cDNA was synthesized using SuperScrip III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was performed on QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR Systems (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Quantification was performed using QuantStudio Design & Analysis Software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with data normalized to the level of Actin mRNA. Total RNA was isolated from both WT and HDAC1/2 cKO cerebral cortices at E12.5 using TRIzol reagent (ThermoScientific) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA-seq was performed at Genomics Core Facility of Shanghai Center for Plant Stress Biology, CAS. For data analysis, sequencing raw reads were first applied quality and adaptor trimming using trim_galore with a quality cutoff of 30 (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/). Cleaned reads were mapped to the mouse reference genome UCSC mm10 () with STAR (). Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 with a cutoff of FDR\u00a0< 0.05 and abs (log2FC)>1. Scatterplotting was generated using R programming language. Prism6 or Excel was used for data analysis. Two-tailed Student\u2019s t test was performed for comparison of two groups of data. Data distribution was assumed to be normal. Two-way ANOVA was used for data of groups more than two. Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments due to the obvious phenotype in mutants.

We show highly specific neurotransmitter\u00a0signaling during neurogenesis in the developing human neocortex and highlight evolutionarily\u00a0divergent mechanisms of physiological signaling.  The neocortex has expanded in mammalian evolution through an\u00a0increase in the number of progenitor cells and the time period over which they produce neurons and glia (). Human radial glia cells, the neural stem cells of the developing cortex, have been subdivided into several subtypes\u00a0characterized by distinct morphologies, dynamic behavior, and transcriptomic profiles (, , ). Ventricular radial glia (vRG) are embedded in an adhesion belt along the ventricle and maintain ventricular contact. Outer radial glia (oRG) (, ) in the outer subventricular zone (OSVZ) arise from vRGs through a process resembling epithelial-mesenchymal transition. oRGs are very rare in mice (, ) and are thought to have significantly contributed to the evolutionary expansion of\u00a0the neocortex in primates and carnivores (). Intermediate\u00a0progenitor cells (IPCs) are multipolar transit amplifying cells generated by radial glia that directly produce most of the excitatory neurons in the neocortex (, , ). Newborn excitatory neurons migrate along radial glial fibers from the germinal zones (GZ) to the cortical plate (CP), eventually forming six layers (), while inhibitory interneurons originate predominantly from the ganglionic eminences and migrate tangentially into the neocortex (, ). Neurotransmitters can induce Ca2+ transients and influence progenitor cell proliferation, neuronal migration, and differentiation in rodents (, , ). Progenitor cells, maturing excitatory neurons and interneurons, endothelial cells, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are all potential sources of neurotransmitters (, , , , , , ). Additionally, axons from extracortical regions such as the diencephalon and brain stem innervate the cortex and affect cortical development (, , , ). Protracted development in humans may suggest a greater role of neurotransmitter signaling in regulating cellular processes. Differences in activity-dependent gene expression as well as differences in gene expression in serotonergic and cholinergic systems between different mammalian species indicate that neurotransmitter signaling has likely impacted cortical evolution (, ). The diverse cell types in the developing neocortex likely respond differently to neurotransmitter signals. In the developing human neocortex, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revealed molecular signatures of distinct cell types (, , ). Neuronal identity, however, is further determined by properties beyond gene expression, including morphology, connectivity, and physiology. Therefore, large-scale analyses of neuronal cell diversity will require multimodal characterization of cells that overlay physiological properties and transcriptomic signatures at the single-cell level. This\u00a0has proven challenging due to technical difficulties (, ). However, combining scRNA-seq with patch-clamp recording has enabled the integration\u00a0of intrinsic physiological and molecular properties in relatively few cells (, , ). We asked whether molecularly distinct cell types in the developing human neocortex also display unique physiological properties. To link neurotransmitter signaling to molecular profiles, we developed a multimodal single-cell approach that allows agonist dosing, response monitoring, and subsequent transcriptomic analysis in the same single cells. Using intracellular calcium elevations as a proxy for physiological responsiveness to a series of neurotransmitter receptor agonists, we found that not only do physiological response properties correlate with molecular identity, but they also capture additional aspects of diversity. Interestingly, inhibition of a serotonergic receptor expressed in human, but not mouse, radial glia disrupts the radial glial scaffold. Together, these findings highlight the cell-type specificity and functional importance of early neurotransmitter-mediated signaling events in the developing human neocortex and provide an avenue for analyzing early active signaling networks. To identify cell-type-specific neurotransmitter receptor systems in the developing human neocortex, we first analyzed the expression of neurotransmitter receptor genes in a scRNA-seq dataset (Table S1) (). While not all receptors are likely to be detectable with scRNA-seq, we did find receptor gene transcripts enriched in specific cell populations of the excitatory lineage using pseudoage analysis (Figure\u00a01A). Two N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor subunits had opposing expression patterns: GRIN2A was highly expressed in progenitors, while GRIN2B expression was only detected in neurons (Figure\u00a01B), consistent with findings from rodent neural stem cells (). The transition from GRIN2A to GRIN2B expression yields channels with faster kinetics and less sensitivity and is important for developmental regulation of synaptic plasticity and the maturation of neuronal circuits (, , ). Similarly, we detected a developmental switch in\u00a0gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) A receptor subunit expression.\u00a0GABRB1 and GABRG1 subunits were expressed in progenitor cells, a subunit combination yielding higher affinity, non-desensitizing GABA responses (, ), while characteristic synaptic subunits GABRB3 and GABRG2 were expressed in neurons (Figure\u00a01C) (). The purinergic P2RY1 receptor was highly expressed in progenitor cells, including radial glia and IPCs, and decreased sharply in neurons (Figure\u00a01D), consistent with reports in rodents (, ). \u03b1-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit GRIA1-3 expression increased as cells differentiated (Figure\u00a01E), in line with increased chromatin accessibility in the promoter regions of GRIA1-4 in the CP compared to the GZ (). We find that neurotransmitter receptor subunits of the same receptor type (e.g., different NMDA receptor subunits) have different and sometimes opposing expression trajectories in the human neocortex that correlate with the development of distinct physiological properties. We found that HTR2A, a receptor not previously reported in progenitor cells (), was highly expressed in first and second trimester human radial glia (Figure\u00a01F). The expression of HTR2A correlated with genes important for progenitor cell proliferation including CTNNA1 and SMARCC2 (Table S1) (, ). Because vRG and oRG cells reside in distinct progenitor regions, we aimed to identify expression of HTR2A in specific laminae by single-molecule fluorescent in\u00a0situ hybridization (smFISH). Starting at postconceptional week 8 (PCW8), HTR2A was strongly expressed in the ventricular and subventricular zones (Figures 1G, S1A, and S1C). Additionally, HTR2A was expressed in the CP at midgestation (Figures 1G and S1C). By performing immunohistochemistry after smFISH, we found that HTR2A colocalized with the vRG marker CRYAB (Figure\u00a01H) and was enriched in cells positive for the oRG marker HOPX (Figure\u00a01I and S1D). HTR2A also colocalized with the mitotic marker Ki67 (Figure\u00a01J) but only rarely with the IPC marker PPP1R17 (Figure\u00a01J). The Htr2a receptor is not expressed during neurogenesis in developing mouse neocortex (Figure\u00a0S1E), indicating the potential evolutionary importance of this receptor in human radial glia. In contrast, P2RY1, which is expressed in progenitors in rodents (, ), was also expressed in the human GZ (Figures S1A\u2013S1C), but not enriched in oRGs (Figure\u00a0S1D). These findings indicate that, in addition to displaying unique molecular signatures (, ), human oRG cells may also be responsive to serotonergic stimulation. We next tested whether receptor mRNAs expressed by neural progenitor cells and immature neurons are translated into functional receptors. Based on transcriptomic (Figures 1 and S1) and physiological studies (, , , , , ), we compiled a panel of neurotransmitter receptor agonists active during brain development that included two specific glutamate receptor agonists, NMDA and AMPA, as well as GABA, acetylcholine (ACh), and purinergic P2RY1 receptor agonist methylthioadenosine diphosphate (MeSADP). Additionally, we included TCB-2, a specific agonist for HTR2A, whose activation induces membrane currents and intracellular Ca2+ elevations in pyramidal neurons and astrocytes (, ). We used patch-clamp recordings in second trimester acute cortical slices to measure currents induced by these neurotransmitter receptor agonists. Cell types were identified based on their anatomical location, electrophysiological properties, morphology, and marker gene expression (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2A\u2013S2C). We found a diversity of cellular responses to agonist application. Consistent with Mg2+ block of the NMDA receptor at hyperpolarized membrane potentials, NMDA only induced currents at positive membrane potentials in neurons (Figure\u00a02C). However, NMDA induced currents at resting membrane potentials in radial glia (Figure\u00a02C), consistent with Mg2+-insensitive NMDA currents recorded in immature neurons, such as subplate (SP) neurons in the developing rodent brain (), as well as glial cells (, ). AMPA and GABA induced currents in all cell types analyzed (Figure\u00a02C). TCB-2 induced currents in vRGs and oRGs, while MeSADP induced hyperpolarization\u00a0only in vRGs (Figure\u00a02C). Receptor specificity was confirmed by antagonists that selectively blocked agonist-induced currents (Figures S2C\u2013S2I). GABA-induced currents in vRGs were larger than in oRGs, which we hypothesized to be due to gap junction coupling among vRGs (). Indeed, application of gap junction blockers significantly\u00a0reduced the GABA current (Figure\u00a0S2I). Together, these recordings show that neurotransmitter receptors are functionally\u00a0diverse in a cell-type-specific pattern in the developing human cortex. To study response patterns to multiple agonists in a broad range of cell types, we microdissected the GZ or CP and SP of midgestation cortical tissue (PCW14\u201322), loaded dissociated cells with a Ca2+ indicator, and recorded fluorescence changes in response to sequential agonist applications (Figures 3A\u20133C). We generated dose-response curves for each agonist to determine supersaturating agonist concentrations that reliably induce responses with little desensitization (Figures S3A\u2013S3C). The order\u00a0of agonist application did not affect the probability of response to specific agonists (Figure\u00a0S3D). The majority of cells from both CP and SP and GZ responded to at least one of the six agonists tested (91.5%\u00a0\u00b1 1.6% in GZ, 99.8%\u00a0\u00b1 0.08% in CP and SP). We found significantly more responses to NMDA, AMPA, ACh, and GABA in cells originating from the CP and SP than GZ (Figures 3B\u20133D). Consistent with receptor expression observed by smFISH (Figures 1 and S1), GZ cells responded preferentially to MeSADP (Figures 3B\u20133D), while cells from both the GZ and CP and SP responded to TCB-2 (Figures 3B\u20133D). Responses were dramatically different during the first and early second trimester (PCW8\u201312) compared to PCW14\u201322, with more than 90% of cells responding to TCB-2 and few cells responding to other agonists (Figure\u00a03E). Interestingly, at an equivalent stage in mouse cortical development, cells did not respond to TCB-2 (Figures S3E and S3F), consistent with in situ RNA expression analysis. Responses to MeSADP were absent\u00a0at PCW8\u201312 (Figure\u00a03E), mirroring the age-dependent effect of purinergic regulation of progenitor proliferation in the rat (). Responses to agonists did not change through midgestation (PCW14\u201322) (Figure\u00a03F), with the exception of GABA responses in the CP and SP, which decreased with age (Figure\u00a03G). Hierarchical clustering of the response patterns\u00a0of cells from PCW8\u201322 revealed 11 physiologically distinct response types (Figure\u00a03H). Combinatorial responses at PCW8\u201312 were largely distinct from those at later stages, and at PCW14\u201322, clusters mostly differed by anatomical source (Figure\u00a03H). Thus, physiological response patterns diversify during development and may reflect a range of cell-type-specific response patterns as cells differentiate. To map physiological response patterns onto cellular diversity, we developed an approach using the microfluidic Polaris device () to couple the recording of Ca2+ responses to transcriptomic analysis of the same single cells (Figure\u00a04A). Cells dissociated from the GZ or CP and SP of mid-gestational cortical tissue were loaded with a Ca2+ dye, and single cells were captured on microfluidic chips. Cells were successively dosed with six agonists at 10-min intervals, while intracellular Ca2+ elevations were simultaneously monitored. Cells were lysed within 1\u00a0h of final agonist application (Figure\u00a04A). The Ca2+ responses observed in dissociated cells on the rig were recapitulated in single cells captured on the microfluidic chips (Figures 3, 4B, 4C, and S4A). Physiologically characterized single cells were processed for scRNA-seq and sequenced at approximately four million reads/cell (Table S3). Unbiased clustering of 476 cells by gene expression from 14 samples ranging from PCW14 to PCW22 revealed ten transcriptomic clusters (Figures 4D and S4B; Table S4). Cells clustered mostly according to their anatomical source, which was not affected by order of agonist application (Figure\u00a0S4C). Importantly, cells that were not dosed co-clustered with dosed cells, indicating that major transcriptome changes were not induced by agonist exposure during this short period (Figure\u00a0S4C). We assigned transcriptomic clusters to known cell types based on marker gene expression (Figure\u00a0S4B; Table S4). One cluster expressed high\u00a0levels of mitotic genes, as well as radial glia and IPC marker genes, and was thus classified \u201cDividing Progenitors.\u201d We next mapped Ca2+ responses onto molecularly defined clusters (Figure\u00a04E). Progenitor cells responded predominantly to TCB-2 and MeSADP, while excitatory neurons and interneurons responded predominantly to glutamatergic and GABAergic agonists\u00a0(Figure\u00a04E). Interestingly, ACh and TCB-2 induced responses preferentially in upper layer excitatory neurons (Figure\u00a04E). AMPA induced responses in medial\u00a0ganglionic eminence (MGE)-derived interneurons and excitatory neurons, while NMDA responses predominated in excitatory neurons (Figure\u00a04E). Caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE)-derived interneurons\u00a0displayed very few responses to any of the six agonists (Figure\u00a04E). In order to obtain a finer classification of cells, we co-clustered cells captured on Polaris microfluidic\u00a0chips with 3,528 neocortical cells captured on C1 microfluidic chips (). Co-clustering revealed 24 transcriptomic clusters, most containing cells captured on both systems (Figure\u00a04F; Table S4). We found that while radial glia responded to TCB-2 with a frequency of 42%\u201358%, 100% of dividing oRGs responded to TCB-2 (Figure\u00a04G). Differential gene expression analysis\u00a0followed by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis between dividing oRGs that were dosed with TCB-2 on the Polaris device and those that were not dosed with TCB-2 and captured on the C1 device revealed no significant differences, confirming that the enrichment of TCB-2 responsive cells in dividing oRGs was not due to induction of cell-cycle genes by TCB-2. Because no significant enrichment of biological processes was associated with dosed compared to non-dosed dividing oRGs (Table S4), we concluded that mitotic oRGs respond preferentially to TCB-2. All progenitors responded to MeSADP stimulation (51%\u201383%), but fewer than 20% of IPCs responded to TCB-2 stimulation (Figure\u00a04G). In summary, our multimodal approach synthesizes\u00a0two distinct measurements of cellular identity\u2014physiological responses and transcriptomic profiles at the single-cell level\u2014that together provide evidence for cell-type- and cell-state-specific neurotransmitter signaling. Given our finding of HTR2A receptor responses in dividing oRGs (Figure\u00a04G), we asked whether HTR2A stimulation promotes progenitor proliferation. Thymidine analog incorporation assays in organotypic slice cultures revealed that stimulation of HTR2A by TCB-2 or inhibition with the specific antagonist (EMD 281014) did not affect proliferation (Figures 5A and 5B). Thus, although TCB-2 responses are enriched in cycling cells, activation of this specific serotonin receptor does not appear to play a role in cell-cycle progression. Htr2a stimulation affects dendritic growth in mouse neurons (, ). We therefore tested whether HTR2A stimulation in radial glia could affect their morphology. We applied the antagonist EMD281014 to cortical organotypic slice cultures for 72\u00a0h and observed a disruption of the radial glial scaffold (Figures 5C\u20135G). Additionally, individual fibers labeled with GFP through viral infection showed aberrant morphology in the presence of EMD281014 (Figure\u00a05C). Co-staining with the oRG marker HOPX revealed that oRG cells in the OSVZ were labeled with the CMV-GFP virus (Figure\u00a05E). Quantification of fiber length in the OSVZ showed a significant reduction in fiber length in the presence of EMD281014 (Figures 5F and 5G; Videos S1 and S2). Taken together, these experiments reveal that serotonergic stimulation has an effect on radial fiber morphology of human oRG cells. Based on the cell-type-specific responses, we hypothesized that physiological and molecular properties might change in concert\u00a0as cells differentiate and mature. Using transcriptomic data, we analyzed physiological responses in the upper layer excitatory neuron lineage (Figure\u00a06A). As cells became postmitotic,\u00a0a dramatic shift in responsiveness occurred: while progenitors responded to TCB-2 and MeSADP, newborn neurons responded to ACh. As neurons matured, they began to respond to AMPA, concomitant with upregulation of neuronal genes such as SYT4, a synaptic protein (Figure\u00a06A). Subsequently, cells became responsive to NMDA, which coincided with expression of GRIN2B, an NMDA receptor subunit, and a subset of more mature upper layer neurons responded to TCB-2 and GABA (Figure\u00a06A). We also analyzed whether the detection of receptor mRNA coincided with responses to specific agonists in the same cell. We found a significant correlation of receptor detection and agonist response in specific cases, such as GRIA1, GRIA2, and GRIA4 expression correlating with AMPA responses, GRIN2B expression coinciding with NMDA responses,\u00a0and GABA responses coinciding with GABBR2 and GABRG2 expression (Figure\u00a0S5A; Table S5). Despite a sequencing depth of four million reads, we did not detect mRNA expression for all receptors in cells displaying responses to specific agonists, highlighting the need to assay rare transcript expression with more sensitive methods such as smFISH (Figure\u00a01) (, , ) or gene product function (Figure\u00a04). We next leveraged our high-dimensional dataset to integrate combinatorial responses to the six agonists with transcriptomic profiling. Using a machine-learning approach, we trained a naive Bayes classifier to recognize response patterns associated with transcriptomically distinct cell types in our multimodal dataset (Figure\u00a04). We found that response patterns alone were highly predictive of cell identity (Figures 6B, 6C, and S5B; Table S5). We then validated the classifier on an independent dataset using the cells recorded in dissociated culture (Figure\u00a03) and found that cell-type assignments matched their region of origin (Figure\u00a06D). While cell-type assignments based on transcriptomes and physiological response patterns were mostly correlated, some differences in classification were found (Figures 6 and S5B). For example, several cells identified as immature upper layer excitatory neurons based on scRNA-seq displayed functional responses of mature upper layer excitatory neurons, illustrating how physiological profiling can help refine transcriptomic clustering of cells into more phenotypically relevant subtypes (). We next sought to study combinatorial responses to the six agonists in an unbiased manner using an unsupervised clustering approach. In order to achieve higher confidence in the physiological response patterns, we combined physiological response patterns in 2,613 cells recorded in culture (Figure\u00a03D) and 347 cells recorded on microfluidic chips (Figure\u00a04). Hierarchical clustering\u00a0revealed 12 distinct physiological response types (P) (Figure\u00a07A). The same physiological profiles that we observed in culture were recapitulated on microfluidic chips (Figure\u00a07A), allowing\u00a0us to use the combined mRNA and response profiling as a\u00a0\u201cRosetta Stone\u201d to translate between physiological profiling and\u00a0gene expression datasets. Differential gene expression analysis between physiological response types revealed cell-type-specific\u00a0gene expression profiles for P-10 (progenitors), P-5 and P-7 (radial glia), and P-2 (upper layer excitatory neurons) (Table S6), in agreement with the correlation of physiological response profiles and molecular clusters (Figure\u00a06B). We next mapped response profiles onto transcriptomic cell clusters (Figure\u00a04D) and found a strong correlation (p\u00a0< 0.05, \u03c72 test; Figures 7B and S6C). Within molecular clusters, cells often fell into several different physiological types (Figure\u00a07B). We hypothesized that functional heterogeneity may relate to cell state or maturation not resolved by unbiased clustering of cells according to their transcriptomes. To understand which molecular features underlie this physiological heterogeneity, we analyzed genes differentially expressed between the two major physiological types (i.e., combination of responses to the six different agonists) in a molecularly defined cell type (Table S6). We found that while cell-type-defining genes were highly expressed in all cells of a certain molecular cluster, other genes were enriched in cells with a specific response type (Figure\u00a07C; Table S6). Importantly, very few immediate early genes, which are transcribed within 1\u00a0h following a stimulus (), were found to be differentially expressed between different physiological types, indicating that transcriptomic differences are unlikely to be induced by agonists but rather reflect cell-state specificity. We performed GO analysis of differentially expressed genes to gain insight into processes that differ between physiologically distinct cells. Genes differentially expressed between the two main response types, P-1 and P-2, in upper layer excitatory neurons were enriched for GO terms related to differentiation, posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression, regulation of RNA, and protein metabolic processes (Figure\u00a07D). Among the differentially expressed genes, we observed regulators of translation initiation (EIF3L, EIF4E, EIF4H) and genes involved in neurotransmitter receptor trafficking (ARHGEF9) (Table S6). In \u201cDividing Progenitors,\u201d genes differentially expressed between P-7 and P-5 were enriched for terms related to cell cycle (Figure\u00a07E). Many genes enriched in P-7 were known regulators of the cell cycle, such as cyclins (CCNB1, CCNB2, CCNE2) (Table S6) corroborating TCB-2 responses are cell-cycle\u00a0dependent (Figure\u00a04G). Genes differentially expressed between P-6 and P-10, the two main response types in IPCs, were related to posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression (Figure\u00a07F), possibly reflecting transcriptional priming and translational repression in progenitor cells (). Additionally, genes related to neurogenesis and differentiation were differentially expressed in IPCs with distinct responses (Figure\u00a07F). Thus, lineage progression and posttranscriptional\u00a0mechanisms of gene expression underlie physiological responsivity. Our multimodal single-cell approach reveals a diverse cellular repertoire of neurotransmitter responses in second trimester human neocortex that can be resolved into cell-type-specific response patterns that change as cells differentiate and mature. By linking physiological and molecular features in single cells, we\u00a0found that cell-intrinsic physiological properties are predictive of molecular identity derived from unbiased clustering of scRNA-seq data, but we also identified physiological heterogeneity within transcriptomically defined cell types. These findings reveal a significant degree of physiological response specialization at stages when synapses are just starting to form, highlighting the potential for neurotransmitter-mediated signaling to influence very early stages of human cortical development. At the early stages studied here, when synapses are mostly restricted to the SP and marginal zone (, , , ), neurotransmitters may be released through non-canonical mechanisms (), such as transporters () or connexin hemichannels (). Additionally, neurotransmitters may be present in the CSF (, , , ) and released from endothelial cells (). There are thus multiple endogenous neurotransmitter sources during stages of neurogenesis and differentiation. We find that newborn excitatory neurons have a response profile\u00a0that is very distinct from that of progenitor cells. Newborn human neurons respond to ACh (Figure\u00a06A), which promotes neuronal maturation and neurite development in mouse (). Subsequently, neurons become responsive to glutamatergic agonists (Figures 6A and S3F). Excitatory neurons respond to both NMDA and AMPA, while interneurons respond most strongly to AMPA stimulation (Figure\u00a04) (). Radial migration of excitatory neurons can be influenced by NMDA-receptor-mediated signaling, whereas tangential migration of interneurons is predominantly controlled by non-NMDA receptors (, , , ). Interestingly, the GRIN2B NMDA receptor subtype is important for migration of neurons to upper cortical layers (), and we find that responsiveness to NMDA in upper layer excitatory neurons correlates with expression of this receptor (Figures 6 and S5; Table S5). MGE-derived interneurons display more responses to AMPA than CGE-derived interneurons, which may be related to migration that occurs earlier in MGE-derived interneurons than CGE-derived interneurons (). Interestingly, GABA responses in mouse progenitor cells were very robust, consistent with previous reports (), but were much less abundant in human progenitors (Figures 3 and S3E). In human, most GABA Ca2+ transients were recorded in a subset of excitatory neurons and are likely to impact\u00a0their migration and maturation (, , ). The developmental switch of chloride transporters NKCC1 and KCC2 determines intracellular chloride concentration and dictates whether GABAA receptor activation is depolarizing (). In mouse, the switch occurs at P7 (), while in human, expression of KCC2 is first evident in the SP at PCW18 and becomes abundant in the CP and SP at PCW25 (). This could explain the decrease in GABA responses in the CP at PCW19\u201322 compared to PCW14\u201316 (Figure\u00a03G). Alternatively, changes in the proportion of cell types present in the CP during later stages of neurogenesis could change the percentage of GABA-responsive cells. Drugs used during pregnancy, for example, to treat epilepsy, often target GABAergic signaling (, ) and may thus affect endogenous GABAergic signaling in the fetal brain. Serotonergic fibers innervate the developing neocortex starting in the first trimester, prior to arrival of thalamocortical afferents (, , ), and are a potential source of serotonin. Additionally, serotonin may be present in the CSF (). We found that expression of HTR2A is enriched in human radial glia and that activation was most prominent in dividing oRGs (Figure\u00a04). Our calcium imaging experiments in mouse (Figure\u00a0S3E), together with gene expression data from public databases, indicate that expression of HTR2A in progenitors may be specific to primates (, ). Previous studies in rodents have demonstrated a role for serotonin regulating neurogenesis during development and in adult (, ). However, we do not find evidence for a role of HTR2A stimulation in proliferation (Figures 5A and 5B). Instead, tonic inhibition of the HTR2A receptor affects radial fiber morphology (Figures 5C\u20135G). Htr2a is expressed in deep-layer subcortical projection neurons in the mouse (Figure\u00a0S1E) (), where it regulates cell survival in addition to dendritic outgrowth (, , ). In contrast, a subset of upper layer excitatory neurons that are more abundant in primates than other mammals () also responds to the HTR2A-specific agonist TCB-2 (Figure\u00a04). Aberrant serotonergic signaling has been linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders, including Down syndrome and autism (), and HTR2A expression is specifically disturbed during neurogenic stages in Down syndrome (). Together with the potential of maternal antidepressants to affect fetal serotonergic signaling, our findings may help explain how aberrant serotonin signaling during fetal development can lead to congenital disorders (, ). The importance of multidimensional analysis of molecular and physiological features for determining cellular taxonomy has been widely recognized but hindered by technological challenges (, ). The approach we developed here to achieve multimodal analysis of single cells is highly versatile because it relies on dynamic imaging of a ubiquitous signal transducer in response to diverse stimuli. Patch-seq has been applied to cells in intact tissue slices (, ). In contrast, our approach can be broadly applied to diverse cell and tissue types using biosensors, allowing the analysis of cell-intrinsic physiological properties. In the future, multimodal surveys at the single-cell level that include physiological features will be critical for evaluating the functional relevance of transcriptomic cell classification and to achieving a meaningful definition of the \u201cground truth\u201d of a cell type. This may also be helpful for evaluating the fidelity of cell types generated in\u00a0vitro (, ). Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Arnold R. Kriegstein (Arnold.Kriegstein@ucsf.edu). The first trimester material was provided by the Joint MRC / Wellcome Trust (grant # 099175/Z/12/Z) Human Developmental Biology Resource (http://www.hdbr.org). De-identified second trimester tissue samples were collected with previous patient consent in strict\u00a0observance of the legal and institutional ethical regulations. Protocols were approved by the Human Gamete, Embryo, and Stem Cell Research Committee (institutional review board) at the University of California, San Francisco All animal experiments were approved by the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Cerebral cortex was dissected from E14 and E18 C57/BL6 or Swiss Webster mouse embryos in ice cold HBSS. Cortices from one litter were pooled together. Tissue was dissociated at room temperature for 5\u00a0min in a papain solution (Worthington). Tissue was subsequently\u00a0bathed in a trypsin inhibitor solution for 1\u00a0min. Cortices were gently triturated in NPC media, which was composed of DMEM (ThermoFisher Scientific) supplemented with N2 (ThermoFisher Scientific), B27 (ThermoFisher Scientific), Glutamax (ThermoFisher Scientific) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (ThermoFisher Scientific), to achieve a single cell suspension. Cells were cultured in NPC media on polyornithine (Sigma) coated glass coverslips at 1.5 million cells per well of a 24 well plate. Coverslips were prepared the following day for calcium imaging. Trajectory plots from published C1 datasets were constructed by correlating cells to excitatory differentiation and ordering cells along this axis. The lines depicting the correlation are shown using loess smooth regression from R package ggplot2. (Figures 1A\u20131F). Correlation of HTR2A expression values to age (pcw) in any radial glia cells as defined by the cluster annotations was plotted (Figure\u00a01F). Networks annotated in  were correlated to HTR2A expression. Networks that correlated to HTR2A expression > 0.4 were used to generate a correlated gene list by including all genes within those networks (Table S1). Tissue blocks were drop-fixed in 4% PFA in PBS overnight at 4\u00b0C. Subsequently, tissue was cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS, and embedded in a 1:1 mixture of 30% sucrose and optimal cutting temperature compound (TissueTek). 16\u00a0\u03bcm cryosections were cut on Superfrost Plus slides (VWR) using Leica CM3050S cryostat. Slides were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. Single molecule in situ hybridization was performed according to the RNAscope manual (2.5 manual assay red chromogen). Sequences\u00a0of target probes, preamplifier, amplifier, and label probe are proprietary and commercially available (Advanced Cell Diagnostics (ACD), Hayward, CA). Typically, the probes contain 20 ZZ probe pairs (approx. 50\u00a0bp/pair) covering 1000bp. Here, we used probes against human HTR2A and P2YR1 as single-plex probe. Slides were dried at 60\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h and fixed in 4% PFA for 2 h. After several washes in PBS, slides were treated with ACD Hydrogen peroxide for 10\u00a0min and then washed in water 2x before treatment in 1x target retrieval buffer (ACD) for 5\u00a0min (at 95-100\u00b0C). After washing in water and then 100% alcohol, the slides were left\u00a0to dry overnight. Protease treatment was performed for 15\u00a0min at 40\u00b0C in the RNAscope oven. Hybridization of probes and amplification\u00a0was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In short, tissue sections were incubated in desired probe (2\u20133 drops/section) for 2\u00a0h at 40\u00b0C. The slides were washed twice times in 1x wash buffer (ACD) for 2\u00a0min each. Amplification and detection steps were performed using the RNAscope 2.5 HD Red Detection Kit reagents (ACD, 320497) for single-plex probes. Sections\u00a0were incubated with Amp1 for 30\u00a0min at 40\u00b0C and then washed two times in wash buffer for 2\u00a0min each. Amp2 was incubated\u00a0on the sections for 15\u00a0min at 40\u00b0C, followed by two washes in wash buffer. Sections were incubated in Amp3 for 30\u00a0min at 40\u00b0C and washed two times in wash buffer for 2\u00a0min each, followed by incubation of Amp4 for 15\u00a0min at 40\u00b0C. Slides were washed two times in wash buffer for 2\u00a0min each. Slides were incubated with Amp5 for 30\u00a0min at RT using the HybEZ humidity control tray and slide rack to maintain humidity. The slides were washed two times in 1x wash buffer for 2\u00a0min each and incubated in Amp6 for 15\u00a0min at RT before washing two times in wash buffer for 2\u00a0min each. Signal was detected by diluting Fast RED-B in Fast RED-A solution (1:60 ratio) and incubating sections in this solution for 10\u00a0min. Slides were washed in water 2 times to stop the reaction. Subsequently, slides were either stained with DAPI and mounted in Aqua Mount (Lerner) or subjected to immunohistochemistry for\u00a0cell type markers using the Perkin-Elmer Tyramide Signal Amplification technology according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Sections\u00a0were blocked using TNB for 45\u00a0min before applying primary antibodies in TNB overnight at 4\u00b0C. Slides were washed in PBS with 0.05% Triton X-100 (PBST), secondary antibodies were applied for 2\u00a0h in TNB together with DAPI. Slides were washed in PBST and incubated in Streptavidin-HRP in TNB (1:200) for 30\u00a0min. Slides were washed in PBST and developed in a 1:50 dilution of Fluorescent Tyramide in AMP for 5\u00a0min. Slides were washed in PBST and mounted in Aqua Mount (Lerner). Images were taken using 40x objectives on Leica confocal microscopes SP5 and SP8. Primary antibodies used after RNAscope: mouse anti Cryab (1:100, ab13496, abcam, detected with Alexa 647), rabbit anti Hop (1:200, sc30216, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, detected with fluorescent tyramide), rabbit anti PPP1R17 (1:100, HPA 047819, Sigma, detected with fluorescent tyramide), mouse anti Ki67 (1:200, M7240, Dako, detected with Alexa647). For immunohistochemistry, goat anti Sox2 (sc17320, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, detected with Alexa647) was used according to a previous protocol (). Unbiased quantification of fluorescent immunohistochemistry and RNAscope FISH was performed using a custom semi-automatic\u00a0macro written for the FIJI distribution of ImageJ (). Nuclei and stained cell regions were identified using multiple noise-cancelling filters and an intensity threshold using the Li method (), segregated using a watershed algorithm, and automatically quantified using the Analyze Particles function. Small regions of high intensity were regarded as noise and were automatically eliminated using the Shape Filter plugin (). Periodic manual quality checks were programmed into the macro to ensure proper thresholding and to manually eliminate blood vessel regions falsely identified as cells. Quantification of colocalization was performed by running previously processed and segmented regions through the Morphological\u00a0Reconstruction plugin from the MorphoLibJ library (). For example, to identify Hopx+ nuclei, the processed DAPI channel was used as the mask image and the processed Hopx channel was used as the marker, yielding an output of all nuclei that stained positive for Hopx. Subsequently, this Hopx+ nuclei channel was used as a mask and the processed RNAscope channel used as a marker to identify Hopx+ nuclei containing RNAscope target mRNA transcripts. All Morphological Reconstruction outputs were quantified automatically using the Analyze Particles function. Chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Modified tissue transfer solutions were used to improve cell survival as described previously (). Cortical slabs were embedded in 4% low melting point agarose (Fisher Scientific) and placed in ice-cold oxygenated (5% CO2/95% O2) artificial CSF (aCSF) solution (pH 7.3 - 7.4, 290 \u2013 300 mOsm) for sectioning containing (in mM): 110 Choline Cl, 2.5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 7 MgCl2, 1.3 NaH2PO4, 25 NaHCO3, 10 glucose. 400\u00a0\u03bcm slice sections were obtained by vibratome (Leica VT1200S) and maintained in an incubation chamber in recovery and recording aCSF containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.3 MgCl2, 1.3 NaH2PO4, 25 NaHCO3, 10 glucose, at room temperature. During experiments, individual slices were transferred to a submerged recording chamber and continuously perfused with the recovery\u00a0and recording aCSF (4.0\u00a0mL/min) at 32\u00b0C. Slices were visualized under a microscope (Olympus BX51WI) using infrared video microscopy and differential interference contrast optics. Different types of cells were first identified by their location, shape of cell bodies, and current-voltage (I-V) curves, subsequently confirmed by immunostaining with cell type specific markers post recordings. Recordings were made with an Axon 700B patch-clamp amplifier and 1320A interface (Axon Instruments). Signals were filtered at 2kHz using amplifier circuitry, sampled at 10 kHz, and analyzed using Clampex 10.2 (Axon Instruments). Patch electrodes were made from borosilicate glass capillaries (BF 150-86-10, Sutter Instruments) and pulled on a P-97 Micropipette Puller (Sutter Instruments) for a resistance in the range of 4-6 M\u03a9. The pipettes were tip- and back-filled with internal solutions containing (in\u00a0mM): 125 K-gluconate, 10 KCl, 10 HEPES, 4 MgCl2, 4 Na2ATP, 0.4 Na4GTP, 0.5 EGTA, 0.2% biocytin for whole-cell recordings. Drugs loaded in micropipettes (tip diameter 50\u00a0\u03bcm) were delivered locally to the recorded cells by pressure pulses using microinjector (Picospritzer III, 20 \u2013 50\u00a0ms duration, 15\u00a0s interval). All antagonists were bath applied. Small depolarizing current pulses (50\u00a0ms duration,\u00a050\u00a0ms interval, 200-500\u00a0pA) were injected into the cell to facilitate biocytin labeling. Each slice was fixed with 4% PFA immediately after recordings overnight at 4\u00b0C for subsequent immunohistochemistry experiments. Primary antibodies: rat anti Ctip2 (1:500, Abcam ab18465), mouse anti EOMES (1:200, Affymetrix 14-4877-82). Biocytin was detected by Streptavidin Dylight 549 (1:500, Vector Labs SA-5549). The germinal and the CP and SP were microdissected in artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing 125\u00a0mM NaCl, 2.5\u00a0mM KCl, 1\u00a0mM MgCl2, 1\u00a0mM CaCl2, 1.25\u00a0mM NaH2PO4 using a microsurgical blade. To obtain a single-cell suspension, tissue samples were dissociated\u00a0in a pre-warmed working solution of Papain and 2000 units/mL of DNase freshly diluted in Earl\u2019s Balanced Salt Solution (Worthington Biochem. Corp.) or using a trypsin-based neural dissociation kit (Miltenyi, 130-093-231). The samples were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 20-30\u00a0min, gently triturated and resuspended in either extracellular solution (ECS) with Mg2+ (145\u00a0mM NaCl, 3\u00a0mM KCl, 3\u00a0mM CaCl2, 2\u00a0mM MgCl2, 10\u00a0mM HEPES, 10\u00a0mM D-glucose, pH 7.4, 290-300 mOsm) and 10% FBS (Sigma) for Polaris experiments, or cell culture media (DMEM, 1% N2, 1% B27, and 1x penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine) with 10% FBS, for overnight culture as described previously (). Cells were centrifuged for 5\u00a0min at 300 x g and washed in the resuspension media without FBS. The suspension was passed through a 40\u00a0\u03bcm strainer cap (BD Falcon) to yield a uniform single-cell suspension. Viability was assessed using Trypan blue staining and automatic quantification using the cell counter Countess (Invitrogen). Viability was normally 90%\u201398%. Dissociated mouse embryonic cortical cells were fixed in 4% PFA for 10\u00a0min after calcium imaging. Cells were washed 3 times in PBS and were blocked for 40\u00a0min in donkey blocking buffer containing 0.2% gelatin, 10% donkey serum (Sigma D9663), and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Primary antibody incubation was performed in donkey blocking buffer at 4\u00b0C overnight with the following antibodies: Rabbit polyclonal IgG Beta-III Tubulin (Covance PRB-435P) and Goat polyclonal Sox-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-17320). The following day, cells were washed 3 times in PBS and were incubated for 1\u00a0h at room temperature with secondary antibody solutions composed of fluorophore conjugated Alexa Fluor dyes (ThermoFisher Scientific) diluted at 1:1000 in donkey blocking buffer. Cells were subsequently stained with the Hoechst nuclear dye (Life Technologies 1:10,000) for 10\u00a0min and then washed 3 times in PBS. Coverslips were mounted onto slides and imaged on a Leica epifluorescence microscope. Immunocytochemistry (ICC) images then were used to match a cell\u2019s protein expression to its calcium responses. A python script was employed to find the same field of cells that were imaged for their calcium responses in the ICC images. To do this, the first frame of a calcium imaging experiment was taken and manually thresholded using ImageJ to remove background fluorescence. Features in this calcium imaging frame were then matched to the nuclear marker stain using a python script that employed packages in the Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV). Specifically, features were detected with the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) package () and subsequently matched with The Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors (FLANN) (). Together, these packages\u00a0identified and matched similar features from the calcium imaging frame with the ICC nuclear marker image regardless of size and scale. Once the matched coordinates in the calcium recording and ICC image were found, the images were manually overlaid and counted to associate protein expression with calcium response. Coverslips (Pretreated German coverslips, Neuvitro, GG-12-Pre) were coated with 10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL Fibronectin (Sigma, F1141) or Matrigel (354234, Corning) in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) overnight at 37\u00b0C. Cells were cultured in cell culture media (see\u00a0above) overnight at 37\u00b0C (5% CO2, 8% O2). Cells were loaded with 5\u00a0\u03bcM Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1, AM (Invitrogen) in ECS with Mg2+ for 30\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C. Cells were washed in ECS with Mg2+. Cells were continuously perfused with ECS without Mg2+ (150\u00a0mM NaCl, 3\u00a0mM KCl, 3\u00a0mM CaCl2, 10\u00a0mM HEPES, 10\u00a0mM D-glucose, pH 7.4, 290-300 mOsm) while imaging. Images were collected using an epifluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51WI) and a Xenon arc light source excitation light with GFP excitation\u00a0bandpass filter. Light pulses were delivered through a filter wheel and Smartshutter (Lambda XL, Sutter). A short exposure (10-20\u00a0ms) and low sampling frequency (1\u00a0Hz) were used to avoid photobleaching. Fluorescence signals were collected using Metafluor\u00a0software. Agonists were applied through a pipette (50\u00a0\u03bcL per agonist diluted in ECS without Mg2+). The interval between agonist applications was 5-10\u00a0min. At the end of each recording, ionomycin was applied as a positive control. See table below for concentrations of agonists used. For analysis of Ca2+ transients, cells were identified as regions of interest using a custom ImageJ macro (). First, the image stack was summed in the Z axis. The phansalkar threshold method () was then applied to increase contrast, using a radius of 15 and standard parameters. ImageJ\u2019s particle analyzer function was subsequently used to identify all possible cells. The identified regions of interest were used to determine the integrated fluorescence intensity in the original image stack. A custom R-based script was then used for plotting normalized traces and assisting with identifying responses to agonists. Gaps in the data (data collection artifacts) were filled with an average of the cell\u2019s fluorescence over the whole recording. The data collected on the physiological rig was filtered using a Chebyshev type II filter (\u2018signal\u2019 package) (). Changes in fluorescence were calculated and normalized against the baseline by F/F0, where F0 is the average fluorescence across\u00a0the whole recording. Peaks at least 5% above the baseline were detected (\u2018pracma\u2019 package) (), in the period between drug injection and up to 150 frames after the application. Additionally, manual curation assessed detected peaks individually\u00a0and adjusted as required, generating a binary matrix of responses to each agonist in each cell. Only cells responding to ionomycin were included. Population responses were analyzed using Prism (unpaired t tests). The Polaris system has been described in detail recently (). Polaris Integrated Fluidic Circuit (IFC) chips were operated according to the manual (PN 101-0075 A1). Priming followed the adherent protocol with 25\u00a0\u03bcg/mL Fibronectin. Dissociated cells were stained with 5\u00a0\u03bcM OGB-1 AM (Thermo Fisher) in ECS with Mg2+ (see above) for 30\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C. Stained cells were captured on microfluidic chips. A custom python script enabled dosing of captured cells with agonists diluted in ECS without Mg2+ followed (duration: approx. 2.25\u00a0min) by washing in ECS without Mg2+. Agonists were added in 10\u00a0min intervals. Concurrently, the same custom script allowed images to be recorded at a frequency of 0.4\u00a0Hz. After dosing, cells were immediately processed for lysis, reverse transcription and PCR on the Polaris IFC (Fluidigm) using the SMARTer Ultra Low RNA Kit (Clontech). The time between the application of the last agonist and the start of the lysis step was approximately 30-60\u00a0min. Single-cell sequencing libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina). Libraries were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq flow cell. Fastq files from individual cells were processed using an automated in-house pipeline on a high-performance computing cluster. Sequencing reads were trimmed off library adapters using TrimGalore! and aligned to the GRCh38 genome reference using HISAT2 (). Aligned reads were summarized to calculate gene counts using featureCounts () and the ENSEMBL GRCh38.88 gene reference. We detected 3118\u00a0\u00b1 47 genes per cell and 3,939,629\u00a0\u00b1 105,874 reads per cell. Counts per million (CPM) were calculated by dividing counts for each gene and cell by total number of counts in the given cell and multiplying by a million. Matrix of CPM values was log-transformed and filtered to remove any cells expressing less than 1000 genes and genes expressed in less than 2 cells. Then, principal component analysis was performed on the transformed matrix. To identify the number of principle components to retain, scree plot analysis was performed to detect the point on the curve when variation associated\u00a0with additional components reached a plateau. Scores of significant principle components were projected onto two-dimensional t-SNE space (). To determine the number of cell clusters, Gap Statistic () was used with partitioning around medoids (PAM) clustering over 1000 bootstraps. PAM method was then used to cluster the data into the number of clusters identified (). To identified gene signatures of each cluster, we used MAST () and zero-inflated regression (zlm) method to compare cells in each given cluster to all the other cells and identify genes upregulated in each cluster (FDR\u00a0< 0.05; fold change \u2265 2). To analyze differential gene expression for cells belonging to the same cluster but displaying differential responses, we utilized RankProd method (). Gene Ontology enrichment analysis\u00a0of differentially expressed genes was performed using Panther Statistical Overrepresentation tests (comparing to all genes expressed in a specific cluster, including correction for multiple testing) (). Gene Ontology Terms were condensed using REVIGO (SimRel algorithm) (). Integration of Polaris and published C1 datasets (, ) was performed using canonical correlation analysis in the space of 20 dimensions (). Subsequent tSNE maps were generated in the reduced dimensionality CCA space. Cluster markers were generated using the zero-inflated log ratio test distribution and interpreted to correspond to published cell types (). Differential gene expression between Polaris and C1-captured single cells was performed using the log-ratio test (LRT) with a bimodal distribution well suited to zero-inflated data such as single-cell transcriptomics. Gene ontology analysis was performed using Panther and the list of genes expressed\u00a0all oRGs as a background. Heatmaps were constructed using Morpheus. Clusters with downregulation of housekeeping genes (\u201cOther\u201d) were defined as outliers\u00a0and excluded from further analysis. Responses to agonists were compared between pairs of transcriptomic clusters using a two-sided Fisher\u2019s exact test. To control for the false discovery rate across the multiple comparisons we use the Benjamini-Hochberg\u00a0procedure. For the pseudotemporal analysis we first project the single cell transcriptomes of the cells belonging to clusters along the lineage on the first two principal components. In this dimensionality-reduced space we then fit a principal curve through the points () (using the R \u2018princurve\u2019 package), which we initialize with the mean coordinates of the first and last cluster in the lineage.\u00a0All cells are then projected onto this principal curve. A cells pseudoage is defined as the arclength along the curve up to their\u00a0projected position. We analyze the dependence of the agonist response frequency on pseudoage using nonparametric logistic regression implemented in PyGAM (https://zenodo.org/record/1213536). In short, the frequencies are modeled as being dependent on the pseudoage via a logit link function of an arbitrary smooth function. This smooth function is assumed to be composed of 20 third-order penalized B-splines with a second derivative penalty of weight 0.6. To allow an interpretation of the pseudoage in terms of different cell types we analyze in the same way how the frequency of detection of marker genes in the transcriptome varies with pseudoage. A naive Bayes classifier was trained on the multimodal single-cell data of all cells responding to at least one agonist. This type of classifier has been shown to learn efficiently from relatively small amounts of data (). Additionally, it is the natural classifier under a plausible generative model of response distributions in which each cell type can be described by a set of independent response probabilities to the different agonists. Pseudocounts of 0.5 were used in the training. No attempt was made to learn a prior distribution of cell type frequencies as we may expect these to differ across conditions. Accuracy of the classifier as assessed by ten-fold cross-validation was found to be 53%\u00a0\u00b1 3% (mean\u00a0\u00b1 SE). The response data were clustered in R using binary clustering metrics and Ward hierarchical clustering. To determine the number of significant clusters, Dynamic Tree Cut () method was used. The analysis of the contingency tables uses Pearson residuals, which are defined as the difference between the observed counts and the expected counts under an independent model normalized by the square root of the expected counts. MAST was utilized to compare single-cell gene expression profiles in each physiological cluster identified when contrasted with the rest of the cells. Genes with FDR\u00a0< 0.05 and abs(log2(FC)) > 0.5 were considered differentially expressed. This protocol was adapted from . Human cortical tissue was embedded in 3% low melting point agarose in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; 125\u00a0mM NaCl, 2.5\u00a0mM KCl, 1\u00a0mM MgCl2, 2\u00a0mM CaCl2, 1.25\u00a0mM NaH2PO4, 25\u00a0mM NaHCO3, 25\u00a0mM d-(+)-glucose, bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2), and sliced at 300\u00a0\u03bcm in ice-chilled ACSF in the vibratome at the plane most closely approximating a coronal section. Slices were transferred\u00a0to and suspended on Millicell-CM slice culture inserts (Millipore) over culture medium (66% BME, 25% Hanks, 5% FBS, 1% N-2, 1% penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine (all Invitrogen) and 0.66% d-(+)-glucose (Sigma)) in 6-well plates and incubated\u00a0at 37\u00b0C, 8% O2, 5% CO2 for 2\u00a0days. For morphology assays, slices were incubated with Ad-CMV-GFP virus (1:2000, Vector Biolabs, 1060) for 30\u00a0min prior to positioning on slice culture inserts. After an overnight recovery, slices were incubated with either HTR2A agonist (100\u00a0\u03bcM TCB-2) or antagonist (100\u00a0\u03bcM EMD 281014 hydrochloride) dissolved in ECS (150\u00a0mM NaCl, 10\u00a0mM HEPES, 3\u00a0mM KCl, 2\u00a0mM CaCl2, 2\u00a0mM MgCl2, 5.5\u00a0mM glucose, pH 7.3), or ECS only as the negative control. 72\u00a0h after agonist application, slices were fixed in 4% PFA. The tissue was subsequently subjected to heat-induced 10\u00a0mM citrate antigen retrieval for 20\u00a0min. Slices were permeabilized and blocked overnight in 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% donkey serum, and 0.2% gelatin in PBS. Primary antibody incubation was performed in the blocking solution for 2\u00a0days at 4\u00b0C. The following primary antibodies were used: chicken anti GFP 1:1000 (Aves, GFP-1020), rabbit anti HopX 1:200 (Santa Cruz, sc30216), and mouse anti Vimentin 1:500 (Sigma, V5255). Secondary antibody and DAPI incubation was performed in blocking solution overnight at 4\u00b0C. The following secondary antibodies were used: Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti chicken (Jackson, 703-545-155), Alexa Fluor 546 donkey anti mouse (Life Technologies, A10036), Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti rabbit (Life Technologies, A31573). After washing slices in PBS, slides were mounted using Aqua Polymount. Images were taken on a Leica SP5 confocal with a 40X objective. Maximum intensity projections were performed using FIJI, and images were adjusted for brightness\u00a0and contrast. For fiber length quantification, confocal image stacks were taken as tile scans using a 40X objective. Outer subventricular zone was delineated from rest of slice, and segmented into five equidistant areas. Two Hopx+ fibers were chosen from\u00a0each area and measured using the \u201cfilament\u201d function in Imaris imaging software (Bitplane). Ten total fibers were measured and recorded in the fiber quantification of each slice to determine the mean fiber length of Hopx+ cells in the outer subventricular zone. For BrdU incorporation assays, BrdU (Sigma, 15\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) was added to the culture medium at the beginning of all culture periods. In these experiments BrdU was present for the entire two-day culture period either HTR2A agonist (100\u00a0\u03bcM TCB-2) or antagonist (100\u00a0\u03bcM EMD 281014 hydrochloride) or HTR2A agonist\u00a0+ antagonist dissolved in ECS, or ECS only as the negative control. Experiments lasted 1 or 2\u00a0days and slices were fixed overnight with 4% PFA afterward. The fixed cortical slices were stained for SOX2 and Ki67 before staining for BrdU was performed. In the first step, the tissue was subjected to heat-induced 10mM citrate antigen retrieval for 20\u00a0min. Slices were permeabilized / blocked overnight in PBS plus 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% serum, and 0.2% gelatin. Primary and secondary incubations were each performed in the blocking solution for 2-3\u00a0days at 4\u00b0C. The following primary antibodies were used:\u00a0goat anti Sox2 (1:250, Santa Cruz, sc17320), mouse anti Ki67 (1:200, Dako, M7240). The following secondary antibodies were used: Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti mouse (Life Technologies, A-21202), Alexa Fluor 546 donkey anti goat (Life Technologies, A-11056). The slices were then re-fixed in 4% PFA for 1\u00a0hr. To stain for BrdU, slices were treated with 2N HCl for 40\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C, neutralized with boric acid, and primary (rat anti BrdU, 1:500, Abcam, ab6326) and secondary (Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti rat, Jackson,\u00a0712-605-153) antibodies were used as previously described. The slices were washed in PBS, and mounted using Aqua Polymount. Images were taken on a Leica SP5 confocal, and adjusted for brightness and contrast using FIJI. For cell counting, single-plane confocal images were collected using a 20x objective. Fluorescence signal from nuclear immunoreactivity was first counted individually using the \u2018spots\u2019 function in Imaris imaging software (Bitplane). A threshold for intensity mean was set to find fluorescent spots of \u223c6-\u03bcm in diameter for each channel as a representation of the number of cells. The preliminary sets of positive cells were then manually edited to correct software error. Double and triple co-localized spots were then calculated by\u00a0the ImarisXT (Bitplane) module, and further edited to correct software errors. The numbers of total and co-localized spots were recorded and subtracted from each other to determine the number of single-, double- and triple-labeled cells. Specific statistical tests are described in the relevant sections. Throughout the manuscript, N refers to the number of biological replicates,\u00a0n refers to the number of cells, error bars show SEM (related to N).

However, whether and how the transmitters co-released from a single vesicle are differentially regulated remains unknown. In matrix-containing dense-core vesicles (DCVs) in chromaffin cells, there are two modes of catecholamine (CA) release from a single DCV: quantal and sub-quantal. By combining two microelectrodes to simultaneously record co-release of the native CA and ATP from a DCV, we report that (1) CA and ATP were co-released during a DCV fusion; (2) during kiss-and-run (KAR) fusion, the co-released CA was sub-quantal, whereas the co-released ATP was quantal; and (3) knockdown and knockout of the DCV matrix led to quantal co-release of both CA and ATP even in KAR mode. These findings strongly imply that, in contrast to sub-quantal CA release in chromaffin cells, fast synaptic transmission without transmitter-matrix binding is mediated exclusively via quantal release in neurons.

Recent studies, however, have revealed that more than one neurotransmitter and/or hormone are co-released from many types of neuron and neuroendocrine cells (, ). The new concept of \u201cone neuron, multiple transmitters\u201d is critical for the complexity of neuronal communication and circuit computation (, , , ). The release of multiple transmitters from one neuron or cell can be differentially regulated (, , ), but whether and how such differential regulation occurs in a single vesicle remains elusive (, , , ). Vesicle secretion can be classified according to two modes of plasma membrane-vesicle fusion: the \u201ckiss-and-run\u201d (KAR, both fast and slow \u201cfusion pore flickers\u201d) and \u201cfull fusion-like\u201d (FFL; for apparent, but still not firmly established, full fusion) modes in either excitable cells for Ca2+-dependent exocytosis (, , , , , , , ) or in non-excitable mast cells for Ca2+-independent exocytosis (). Alternatively, based on the vesicle contents remaining after exocytosis, vesicular secretion can also be classified according to two modes of native transmitter release: \u201cquantal\u201d (all-or-none or complete release) and \u201csub-quantal\u201d (\u201cstand-alone foot\u201d or partial release) (). We have previously reported that catecholamine (CA) release tends to be sub-quantal when fusion pore expansion is limited by intrinsic dynamin 1 () and by either activating an inhibitory G-protein-coupled receptor () or knockout (KO) of the Ca2+ sensor protein synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7) (, ) in adrenal chromaffin cells. It is known that CA and ATP co-exist in the same dense-core vesicles (DCVs) in chromaffin cells (, , ). Following the modes of vesicle fusion pore regulation by inhibitory G-protein-coupled receptor \u03b2\u03b3 (GPCR-Gi-\u03b2\u03b3), Ca2+, or Syt7 KO (, , , , ), CA release from a single DCV shifts from quantal to sub-quantal, but it is unclear whether ATP co-release from the same vesicle becomes sub-quantal. Neurons and endocrine cells have two distinct types of secretory vesicles, DCVs and small clear vesicles; the major difference is the presence of a matrix in DCVs (, ). Chromogranin A (CgA) is the main matrix protein and plays important roles in CA storage and exocytosis in chromaffin cells (, ). Sub-quantal release of vesicle contents in kiss-and-run events is thought to be induced by fusion pore restriction in both DCVs (, , ) and synaptic small clear vesicles (, ). However, whether other non-fusion pore factors regulate kiss-and-run release is unknown. In this work, by combining micro-carbon fiber electrode (CFE) recordings (, , ) and whole-cell \u201cATP sniffer\u201d (patch-clamped HEK293A cells expressing P2X4 channels) recordings (, ) in chromaffin cells, we found that, although the two native neurotransmitters ATP and CA are co-released simultaneously from a common fusion pore, their release modes can be opposite: ATP is quantal, whereas CA is sub-quantal for kiss-and-run (and quantal for FFL). Chromaffin DCVs contain many co-cargos, including peptides, CA, and ATP (). To determine whether CA and ATP are co-released from a single vesicle, we combined two types of microelectrode recordings from a single cell, using a CFE to record CA as CA oxidization current (ICA) and a sniffer cell to record ATP as P2X4 channel current (IATP). Remarkably, our dual-electrode system indeed permitted simultaneous recordings of CA and ATP co-release from a single vesicle (Figures 1A and S1\u2013S3) as well as temporally coupled quantal events following KCl depolarization (Figure\u00a0S1). The shorter duration of CA versus ATP quanta was due to CA oxidation (and inactivation) at the CFE sensor surface (STAR Methods; ). Thus, CA and ATP are co-released from individual DCVs in chromaffin cells (see STAR Methods for definitions of parameters of quantal CA and ATP release). Somatostatin (SOM) is an endogenous ligand of GPCR-Gi that restricts fusion pore expansion to shift the fusion mode from FFL to kiss-and-run (). Surprisingly, SOM (500\u00a0nM) substantially reduced the apparent quantal size of CA (Figures 1B\u20131D), whereas its rise time (RT) and half-height duration (HHD) remained unchanged (Figure\u00a01D). In contrast, SOM did not change the quantal size of ATP (Figure\u00a01E). In the\u00a0absence of SOM, the quantal kinetics of CA and ATP remained the same in two\u00a0repeated stimulations (Figure\u00a0S4). In the presence of an antagonist of SOM receptors (cyclosomatostatin, 1\u00a0\u03bcM), the inhibitory effect of SOM on CA was eliminated (Figures 1F, 1G, and S5A). Together, the differential release of the co-cargos CA and ATP from a single vesicle are regulated in this kiss-and-run\u00a0model through the SOM-GPCR-Gi signaling pathway. Syt7 is an abundant Ca2+ sensor for exocytosis (). The fusion pore is restricted in Syt7 KO chromaffin cells, so they provide a second kiss-and-run model (). We compared the quantal size of CA and ATP release in wild-type (WT) and KO cells and found that it was significantly lower for CA but not for ATP in Syt7 KO versus WT cells (Figures 2 and S5B), whereas their evoked intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was similar (Figure\u00a0S6). Electron microscopy showed similar vesicle diameters, and western blots showed similar expression levels of the vesicle monoamine transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase as well, implying that DCV size and content were not altered by Syt7 KO (Figure\u00a0S7; , , ). Finally, the quantal size for CA was fully rescued by Syt7 overexpression in Syt7 KO cells (Figures 2E and 2F; STAR Methods). Together, during release of a single vesicle in Syt7 KO versus WT cells, the significantly smaller CA quantal size was sub-quantal, whereas the co-released ATP quantal size remained unchanged as quantal, confirming that CA and ATP co-released from a single vesicle are differentially regulated in the kiss-and-run model of Syt7 KO chromaffin cells. According to the above dual recordings of single-vesicle co-release in the two kiss-and-run models, ATP release is quantal, whereas CA release is sub-quantal. Next, we further investigated the relationship between the modes of vesicle fusion and the modes of CA (or peptide co-cargo) release from a single vesicle. To confirm that fusion pore expansion is inhibited in both kiss-and-run models (SOM and Syt7 KO) (, ), we used total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to image vesicle fusion. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is native in chromaffin DCVs (, ), making NPY-pHluorin an ideal indicator to visualize the release of single DCVs in these cells (). In immunofluorescence assays, NYP-pHluorin displayed a punctuate pattern and co-localized with the DCV marker CgA and secretogranin II (Figure\u00a03A). We defined the two modes of vesicle fusion by TIRF imaging, FFL (corresponding to quantal), and kiss-and-run (corresponding to sub-quantal). Based on previous definitions (), FFL and kiss-and-run events can be distinguished by the release pattern in the central annular area (Figures 3B and 3C; , , ; see STAR Methods for details). In the SOM kiss-and-run model, the ratio (kiss-and-run-total fusion events) of evoked events increased from \u223c30% to \u223c55% with SOM treatment (Figure\u00a03D; Videos S1, S2, and S3). This result was further confirmed in the Syt7 KO kiss-and-run model (Figure\u00a03E). In addition, RT and HHD were\u00a0smaller in FFL than in kiss-and-run events in WT cells (Figure\u00a0S8), indicating faster acidification by FFL than kiss-and-run. Together, TIRF imaging confirmed that, after treatment of either model, the vesicle fusion mode was shifted from FFL to kiss-and-run, corresponding to quantal versus sub-quantal CA release. Next, we investigated the mechanism underlying the differential release of the two co-cargos ATP and CA. CA (\u223c184 Da) is smaller than ATP (\u223c507 Da), so the diffusion rate of CA would be faster in the absence of binding to other substances. This was confirmed by in\u00a0vitro experiments on the diffusion of ATP versus CA under the same conditions (Figure\u00a0S9). This finding was contrary to the sub-quantal CA versus quantal ATP when they were co-released by free diffusion from a DCV. We therefore investigated whether the DCV matrix binds and restricts CA but not ATP diffusion from vesicles using knockdown (KD) and rescue of the major matrix protein CgA in transfected chromaffin cells, as identified by its GFP fluorescence (Figure\u00a0S10). Western blot analysis of HEK293 cells and immunofluorescent staining of chromaffin cells revealed an \u223c75% reduction by CgA KD and rescue by small hairpin RNA interference (shRNAi) (Figures 4A and 4B). Electron microscopy showed an increased ratio of empty vesicles in cells transfected with CgA KD versus control (Figure\u00a04C). Importantly, SOM failed to reduce CA quantal size in cells with two independent CgA KD shRNAs (Figures 4F and 4G), although SOM did reduce the CA quantal size after transfection with scrambled small hairpin RNA (shRNA) (Figure\u00a04E). The inhibitory effect of SOM on CA quantal size was fully restored by shRNA-resistant rescue plasmids (Figure\u00a04H). In contrast, ATP quanta were completely insensitive to CgA KD (Figures 4D and S10). CgA KD reduced the dense core size by \u223c75% but did not affect quantal size (Figure\u00a04), whereas CgA KO is known to significantly reduce quantal size (). On the other hand, the SOM effect on release modes was abolished by CgA KD (Figure\u00a04). To further determine the role of DCV-CgA in quantal size and release mode, we generated CgA KO\u00a0mice using the guide RNA (gRNA)/Cas9 system. DNA sequencing and western blots showed that CgA KO mice were generated successfully (Figures 5A and 5B). In contrast to CgA KD and WT chromaffin cells (Figure\u00a04), we confirmed that CgA KO significantly reduced CA quantal size by 47% (Figure\u00a0S11), which was consistent with a previous report (). On the other hand, similar to CgA KD cells, SOM also failed to reduce the CA quantal size in CgA KO cells (Figures 5C and 5D). Combined CA and ATP recordings demonstrated that SOM specifically modulated CA quantal size in WT but not CgA KO cells, whereas SOM did not modulate ATP quanta in WT and CgA KO cells (Figures 5C and 5D). By definition, modes of release (sub-quantal versus quantal) are different from modes of vesicle fusion (kiss-and-run versus FFL) because kiss-and-run fusion may produce either quantal (ATP) or sub-quantal (CA) events (Figure\u00a04). To determine whether CgA KD affected SOM-induced fusion pore flickering (or kiss-and-run) (), we assessed fusion pore size during exocytosis-endocytosis using two nano-particle dextrans of different molecular weights and sizes (10\u00a0kDa and 40\u00a0kDa or 5\u00a0nm and 9\u00a0nm in diameter) (, , ), given that SOM-induced endocytosis takes up only 5-nm but not 9-nm dextran in CgA WT cells. CgA KD did not affect the original patterns of SOM-induced uptake of both dextrans, and membrane fusion (kiss-and-run or fusion pore flickers) was not altered by CgA KD (Figure\u00a06). In addition to primary cultured chromaffin cells, similar differential co-release of CA and ATP in WT versus Syt7 KO was also found in adrenal slices (Figure\u00a0S12). This implied that the above differential co-release might occur in\u00a0vivo as well. Consistent with reduced CA release in cultured adrenal chromaffin cells and slices using the Syt7 KO kiss-and-run model, the blood CA level was 40% lower and heart function was 30% higher in Syt7 KO than in WT mice (Figure\u00a0S13). This was presumably because the blood CA is mainly produced by adrenal chromaffin cells (). One major finding in the present work in chromaffin cells is that 1 vesicle (DCV) releases 2 native transmitters via 2 release modes: quantal and sub-quantal (the \u201c1-2-2 phenomenon\u201d). This is supported by the following evidence: (1) individual amperometric spikes represented CA release from single vesicles (Figures 1, 2, and S1), as established previously (, , ), and ATP sniffer spikes represented ATP release events (Figure\u00a0S1; , ); (2) most CA events were coincident with ATP events, indicating that CA and ATP are discharged as co-cargos from one vesicle (Figures 1A and S1); (3) SOM reduced the quantal size of CA but not ATP events in the GPCR-Gi model of the kiss-and-run fusion mode (Figures 1 and S5A); (4) in the Syt7 KO model of the kiss-and-run fusion mode, quantal size decreased in CA but not ATP events, and this was fully rescued by Syt7 overexpression (Figures 2, S5B, S6, and S7); and (5) TIRF imaging, a CFE-independent assay, further confirmed the existence of inducible sub-quantal versus quantal peptide (NPY-pHluorin) release from DCVs (Figures 3 and S8), consistent with the same pattern of CA release (Figure\u00a01). These results establish the presence of the 1-2-2 phenomenon in chromaffin cells. The mechanism underlying the 1-2-2 phenomenon is regulated by two factors: the two vesicle fusion modes kiss-and-run and FFL () and the intravesicular matrix, which binds CA (but not ATP) during a vesicle fusion event (Figure\u00a06D). This is supported by the following findings from single-vesicle events: (1) kiss-and-run fusion-mediated release was substantially decreased by GPCR-Gi (Figures 1 and 3) and (2) kiss-and-run fusion-mediated release was substantially decreased by Syt7 KO (Figures 2 and 3), which establishes that kiss-and-run vesicle fusion is required for sub-quantal CA release from DCVs. (3) CgA KD and CgA KO both eliminated SOM-induced sub-quantal CA release (Figures 4A, 4B, 4E\u20134G, and 5). (4) Rescue of CgA restored the sub-quantal release of CA (Figure\u00a04H). (5) The kiss-and-run fusion mode alone is not sufficient to produce the 1-2-2 phenomenon, because sub-quantal release of CA was abolished by CgA KD or KO (Figures 4 and 5) even though the fusion pore was intact (Figures 6A\u20136C), indicating that kiss-and-run is not sufficient and implying that kiss-and-run vesicle fusion or fusion pore flickering is independent of the matrix (Figures 6A\u20136C). (6) Electron microscopy (EM) imaging confirmed that CgA KD prevented matrix formation in DCVs (Figure\u00a04C); (3) to (6) establish that matrix-CgA is required for sub-quantal CA release. (7) The RT of soluble CA (or co-released ATP) remained unchanged in control versus sub-quantal models (Figures 1D and 2C), no matter whether the pore size was large (>9\u00a0nm, FFL mode) or small (5\u20139\u00a0nm, kiss-and-run mode) (Figures 6A\u20136C; , , ). Because there were more kiss-and-run events in the kiss-and-run models (SOM-treated or Syt7 KO) than in control cells (Figure\u00a03), these data strongly implied that a DCV discharges all soluble CA and ATP during every vesicle fusion event (Figure\u00a0S14). (8) ATP release was insensitive to both SOM and CgA KD (Figures 4D and S10), indicating that most of the ATP release is completed before the fusion pore closes again in either FFL or kiss-and-run fusion mode. (9) In native cells, sub-quantal release occurred in CA events but not in paired ATP events (Figures 1 and 2), or the apparent CA release rate is slower than that of co-released ATP, implying that matrix binds CA (but not ATP) in DCVs (, ). (10) Conversely, the diffusion rate of ATP in\u00a0vitro was slower than that of CA (Figure\u00a0S9), strongly supporting the hypothesis in (9) of a higher affinity of CgA matrix for CA versus ATP in vesicles (Figure\u00a04). (11) TIRF microscopy imaging revealed that, with the de-acidification of NPY-pHluorin during vesicle fusion, RT and HHD were smaller in FFL than in kiss-and-run events in WT cells (Figure\u00a0S8), indicating faster acidification by FFL than by kiss-and-run. (7) to (11) establish that, in contrast to CA, the kinetics of co-released ATP are relatively insensitive to both matrix and kiss-and-run fusion. Notably, the two vesicle release modes (quantal versus sub-quantal) are often confused with the two vesicle fusion modes (FFL versus kiss-and-run). However, kiss-and-run fusion can result in either sub-quantal or quantal release (Figure\u00a06D). What is the mechanism underlying the role of the kiss-and-run fusion mode in producing sub-quantal CA release? The DCV has an acidic pH of 5.5 to accumulate CA. Opening the fusion pore\u00a0increases the intravesicular pH for CA-matrix unbinding (, ). In the kiss-and-run fusion mode, the smaller fusion pore (5\u00a0nm) allows sub-quantal release, corresponding to a slow intravesicular pH increase by competition between H+ efflux and H+ influx by the ATPase pump versus fusion pore size (Figure\u00a0S8). In the FFL mode, the larger fusion pore size (>9\u00a0nm) allows rapid pH increase for CA-matrix unbinding and quantal CA release (Figure\u00a0S8). In cells with KD or KO CgA, even kiss-and-run fusion leads to quantal CA release, probably because most CA (like ATP) is free in the vesicle for release (Figures 4 and 5). It is interesting that CgA KD did not change the CA quantal size (Figures 4E\u20134G), whereas the CA quanta were 30%\u201347% smaller in CgA KO cells (Figures 5C, 5D, and S11; ). One possibility concerning the similar quantal size in WT and CgA KD (but smaller in CgA KO) is a \u201cphase transition\u201d between crystalline (CgA-containing WT and KD) and dissolved (CgA KO) states. The soluble norepinephrine concentration [NE] is saturated in the presence of crystalline NE-CgA, just as the Na concentration is saturated in crystalline NaCl (). Regarding potential physiological relevance, the 1-2-2 phenomenon exists not only in cultured chromaffin cells (Figures 1 and 2) but also in adrenal slices (Figure\u00a0S12), suggesting that it partially contributes to a reduced blood CA level and heart function in\u00a0vivo (Figure\u00a0S13), critical indices of both normal physiology and heart failure (). Regarding the method of dual transmitter recordings from a single fusion pore, a previous study in pancreatic \u03b2 cells used dual recordings to detect ATP and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) from a single vesicle (). However, in their experiments, 5-HT was a false transmitter introduced by preloading, whereas both ATP and CA are native transmitters in the present work. This is essential because a false transmitter may differ completely in release kinetics from native transmitters. Since the finding of Ca2+-induced sub-quantal CA release in chromaffin cells (, ), kiss-and-run has been reported to be a common vesicle fusion mode in many cells containing DCVs (, , , , ). Studies using capacitance and fluorescent dye measurements have proposed that kiss-and-run vesicle fusion may occur in fast synaptic transmission, but whether sub-quantal release occurs in central synaptic transmission is still hotly debated (, , , , , ). Our present work demonstrates that, in a matrix-containing DCV, co-cargos are released via both quantal (ATP) and sub-quantal (CA) mechanisms. In a matrix-free vesicle, however, all cargos are instantly discharged as quantal release in chromaffin cells. Because the vesicle fusion protein machinery is similar in both DCVs and synaptic vesicles (, , ), the kinetics of transmitter release through a fusion pore are also similar (, , , ). If a neurotransmitter is free in a synaptic vesicle, our present work strongly argues that synaptic release is always via the quantal (all-or-none) release mode.

Adult mice (2-4\u00a0months old, both sexes of animals) were used for isolation of adrenal medulla chromaffin cells. Mice were housed under a 12-h light-dark cycle with food and water. The Syt7-KO mice on a C57BL/6 background were a gift from Thomas C. S\u00fcdhof (Stanford University) and Weiping Han (Singapore Agency for Science, Technology and Research) (). CgA-KO mice were generated with the gRNA/Cas9 system in our lab (Figures 5A and 5B). Mice were maintained in the Animal Center of Peking University. All procedures and animal care were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Peking University (Beijing, China) and the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. Adult mice (2-4\u00a0months old) were used for all experiments. All chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Mouse adrenal chromaffin cells (MACCs) were prepared as described previously (, ) with minor modifications. Briefly, the adrenal glands were isolated from anesthetized animals (10% chloral hydrate), cut into pieces, and incubated in papain solution for 40\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C after removing the cortex. The pieces of adrenal medulla were triturated gently through a 200\u00a0\u03bcL pipette tip. After centrifugation, cells were quickly plated on coverslips pre-coated with 0.1% poly-L-lysine, incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2, and used within 24-72 h. MACCs were transfected for genetic manipulations by electroporation using the vector pRNAT-H1.1-RFP/GFP as described previously (), with the Neon Transfection System MPK1096 (Invitrogen, USA), using a 20-ms pulse at 1300\u00a0V (). After primary culture for 24-72 h, transfected cells were identified under a microscope by their GFP fluorescence. HEK293A cells were prepared and transfected as described previously (). For sniffer-cell preparation, whole-cell-clamped HEK293A cells expressing P2X4 receptors were used as ATP-sniffers (, ). The pIRES2-EGFP-rP2X4 construct was a gift from Stanko Stojilkovic (National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health USA). When the density reached \u223c90% in dishes, HEK293A cells were transfected with the P2X4 construct using Vigofect reagent (Vigorous, China) and then cultured for \u223c18 h. The sniffer cells were trypsinized and plated on coverslips before experiments. Adrenal slices were prepared as described previously () with slight modification. Briefly, adrenal glands were removed from adult mice (2-4\u00a0months old) and immediately placed in ice-cold cutting solution containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5\u00a0KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, and 10 glucose (pH 7.4, saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2). Then, a single gland without fat was glued to the stage of a vibratome (Leica VT 1200S, Germany) with 3% agarose and cut into 150-\u03bcm slices. Slices were incubated for at least 30\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C in cutting solution, and then kept at room temperature before recordings. Slices were used within 12\u00a0h after cutting. The nucleotide target sequences of chromogranin A (CgA), GGA ACA TAA GCA GGA GGA AGA (shRNA-1) and GCT ACA AAG CGA TCC AGA AAG (shRNA-2) were chosen to silence its expression. A random sequence, TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT, predicted not to target any gene in human, rat, or mouse cells, was chosen as a negative control (Guangzhou Ribo Bio Co., Ltd, China). Annealed double-stranded oligonucleotides encoding the target sequences were subcloned into the vector pRNAT-H1.1-RFP/GFP to generate plasmids expressing the scrambled shRNA and two shRNAs against CgA. An shRNA-1-resistant form of CgA for the rescue experiments was generated by introducing the following silent mutations: GGA GCA CAA ACA AGA GGA AGA, in the mouse CgA plasmid. This was used to rescue the effect of shRNA-1 in MACCs. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. For TIRF experiments, an NPY-pHluorin plasmid was constructed from NPY-Venus (a kind gift from Dr. Nikita Gamper, University of Leeds). The pIRES2-EGFP-Syt7 plasmid construct was a gift from Weiping Han (Department of Biochemistry, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore). CA recordings were performed with carbon fiber electrodes 7\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter (CFE, Dagan, Minneapolis, USA) and a PC-2C amplifier (Yibo, Wuhan, China), and ATP-sniffer recordings were made using an Axon 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices), as described previously (, ). For dual transmitter (CA and ATP) recordings, an ATP-sniffer probe was placed so as to touch a chromaffin cell at a site near the CFE (Figures 1A and S1F). The CFE was held at 780\u00a0mV to detect CA release as amperometric current, ICA, and the patched sniffer-cell was held at \u221270\u00a0mV to detect ATP release as P2X4-sniffer current, IATP. The\u00a0combined CA and ATP recordings were made with and/or without stimulation. The duration of ATP quanta recorded by sniffer is \u223c10 times longer than that of CA quanta recorded by CFE (), although the kinetics of release of the two co-transmitters from a single vesicle were similar. In CFE recording, CA is oxidized at 780\u00a0mV and thus produces 2 electrons per CA as CFE signals. The oxidized CA\u2217 is electrochemically inactive. However, in sniffer recording, ATP can transiently bind and unbind (activate/deactivate) a P2X4 channel, then rebind and reactivate another P2X4 again. This is consistent with the finding that the signal duration in fast-scan cyclic voltammetry is \u223c7 times longer than that of amperometry (). It is known that the P2X4-ATP-sniffer is capable of determining the relative sizes of quantal ATP release events during an ACC recording (). CFE events and ATP-sniffer events occurring within 15\u00a0ms were taken to be coupled. The CFE and sniffer recordings were sampled at 5 kHz, and the signals were low-pass filtered at 1 kHz. The CFE amperometric current is defined as the CA release index ICA, which is proportional to the CA concentration on the CFE sensor surface (, , ). The P2X4-sniffer current is defined as the ATP release index IATP, which is proportional to the ATP concentration on the sniffer sensor surface (Figure\u00a0S1). Note that, although both ICA and IATP are proportional to the release concentration of their own transmitter, their scales are different (i.e., 1\u00a0pA of ICA versus IATP corresponds to different concentrations of CA versus ATP). Quantal events were analyzed as described previously (, ). The data were analyzed using Mini-analysis (Synaptosoft, USA) and Igor software (WaveMetrix, UK). To monitor release events originating close to the CFE and sniffer cell, we only analyzed CFE spikes with amplitudes > 15\u00a0pA and sniffer spikes > 40\u00a0pA, except for the coincidence analysis in Figure\u00a01A in which smaller signals (ICA > 5\u00a0pA and IATP > 15\u00a0pA) were used. Stimulation solutions (70\u00a0mM KCl or other drugs) were delivered by a perfusion system (Yibo, Wuhan, China) with a fast exchange time (< 100\u00a0ms). An Olympus IX-81 inverted microscope with a 100\u00a0\u00d7 TIRF objective (Olympus, Japan) was used to capture TIRF images. The fluorescence emitted by MACCs expressing NPY-pHluorin was captured by an Andor EM-CCD with an exposure time of \u223c50\u00a0ms using Andor iQ2 software. All TIRF experiments were performed at 35\u00b0C maintained by a home-made objective heater. The standard bath solution contained (in mM): 145 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2-6H2O, 10 H-HEPES, and 10 D-glucose, pH 7.4. Drugs or solutions were applied via a perfusion system (Yibo, Wuhan, China). MACCs in uniform contact with the coverslip were chosen for imaging NPY-pHluorin release. An exocytotic event was defined as an abrupt fluorescence increase immediately followed by a decrease or diffusion of the fluorescence in the vicinity, as described previously (). In the analysis of single release events, each event was selected and marked with circular areas 1.92-\u03bcm (center) and 2.4-\u03bcm (annulus) in diameter, following earlier reports (, ). This \u201ccenter and annulus\u201d method for separating KAR and FFL events has been established in astrocytes () and DRG neurons (), and it also worked in ACCs (Figures 3B and 3C, see also Videos S1, S2, and S3). Similar to a previous report (), an FFL event showed a robust fluorescence increase at both the center and the annular area of NPY-pHluorin puncta, indicating dilation of the fusion pore and the subsequent spreading of vesicular content. In contrast, a KAR event showed a brief appearance only in the center, but no or only a very limited fluorescence increase in the annular area (Figures 3B and 3C), indicating a transient fusion pore opening, re-closure, and re-acidification process (, , ). The EM protocol was as described previously with minor modification (, ). The adrenal glands were removed from adult WT and Syt7-KO mice, cut into 1-2\u00a0mm3 pieces after removal of the cortex, and placed in a 1\u00a0mL tube. The pieces were immersed in 5% glutaraldehyde and 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 1-2\u00a0h at room temperature, washed 3 times with 0.1\u00a0M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 5\u00a0min each), then fixed in 1% OsO4 for 1 h. The fixed pieces were serially dehydrated in ethanol followed by flat-embedding in Epon812 and polymerization for 36\u00a0h at 60\u00b0C. Then they were cut into 80-nm sections, stained with 2% uranyl acetate followed by 0.5% lead citrate, and imaged at 120 KV in a Tecnai G2 20 200KV transmission electron microscope (FEI, USA). Single-cell EM was the same as that for tissue, except that the cells of interest were identified and their locations marked before fixation. Quantitative analysis was performed with ImageJ (NIH, USA) as described previously (). Isolated MACCs were incubated in a bath solution containing 5\u00a0\u03bcM Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, USA) for 15\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C. The intracellular Ca2+ concentration was measured by dual-wavelength ratiometric fluorometry. The Fura-2 was excited by light alternating between 340\u00a0nm and 380\u00a0nm using a monochromator system (TILL Photonics, Germany), and the emission fluorescence was measured using a cooled CCD. The Ca2+ concentration was calculated from the ratio of F340 to F380, and the sampling frequency was 1\u00a0Hz triggered by the HEKA amplifier. The Ca2+ fluorescence signals were analyzed using Igor software (WaveMetrix, USA) (). Cultured MACCs were washed 3 times in pre-cooled (4\u00b0C) PBS and treated with different sizes of dextrans (10\u00a0kDa of \u03a6 5\u00a0nm and 40\u00a0kDa of \u03a6 9\u00a0nm; Molecular Probes, D1816 and D1842 (, , )) in 70\u00a0mM KCl stimulation solution for 1\u00a0min. Then the cells were immediately fixed in 4% PFA for 15\u00a0min and washed 3 times in PBS. For a better background, we refreshed the PFA after fixation. MACCs were mounted in 50% glycerol with DAPI. All the above experiments were performed at room temperature. Samples were lysed in a buffer containing 50\u00a0mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 2% proteinase inhibitor cocktail. Then the extracts were centrifuged at 15,000\u00a0g for 30\u00a0min and the concentration of the solubilized protein was determined by a protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). To assess various proteins in different dishes, equal amounts of protein were loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE gels and western blot analyses were performed with specific antibodies in 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and a standard secondary antibody staining procedure was followed. The following primary antibodies were used: CgA (ab15160, Abcam), VMAT1 (ab168347, Abcam), TH (AB152, Millipore), and actin (A5316, Sigma). The secondary antibodies were IRDye 800CW goat anti-rabbit IgG (LIC-926-32211, LI-COR Biosciences) and IRDye 680CW goat anti-mouse IgG (LIC-926-32220, LI-COR Biosciences). For quantitative analysis, the protein bands were scanned with an infrared scanner (Odyssey, Gene Company, Hong Kong) and analyzed with ImageJ (NIH, USA) (). Cells were pre-fixed in 4% PFA for 15\u00a0min, washed 3 times with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton in PBS for 3\u00a0min. Then, the cells were incubated with 2% BSA for 1 h, incubated with primary antibody (CgA, ab15160, Abcam; SgII, ab12241) at 4\u00b0C overnight, and incubated with secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor\u00ae 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG, A11037, Invitrogen) after washing with 2% BSA in PBS. After that, the cells were mounted on coverslips immersed in 50% glycerol. Fluorescence images were acquired on a confocal microscope (Zeiss 710, Germany) and analyzed with ImageJ (NIH, USA). The adrenal glands were removed from anesthetized mice, cut into small pieces, and placed in 24-well plates with 100\u00a0\u03bcL of 2.5\u00a0mM KCl basal solution. After 1-min incubation, the 100\u00a0\u03bcL basal solution was taken to estimate basal ATP release using ATP Luciferase/Luciferin Reagent (Promega, USA) and measuring the fluorescence with a microplate reader (Biotek, USA). Then, the basal solution was substituted with 100\u00a0\u03bcl 70\u00a0mM KCl solution for 1\u00a0min before the solution was taken to estimate ATP concentration. The fluorescence ratio of the stimulated sample (70\u00a0mM KCl) to that of the basal sample was used to assess the ATP release from chromaffin cells in adrenal slices. Blood was taken from the eyeball of each anesthetized mouse and then centrifuged for 15\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C following the standard protocol (). After centrifugation for 2\u00a0min, the sample was mixed with NH4OH-NH4Cl buffer and dipropylmethane, then transferred to a mixture of octanol and 80\u00a0mM CH3COOH and centrifuged for 2\u00a0min. Samples of the sediment were transferred to a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) apparatus with an electrochemical detector (Waters, USA) for measurement of norepinephrine and its metabolite DHPG (3,4-dihydroxyphenylethyleneglycol). Briefly, the samples were eluted with a mobile phase containing (in mM) 70 KH2PO4, 0.11 EDTA, 0.72 SDS, and 20% (vol/vol) methanol, and the solvent was delivered at 0.25\u00a0mL/min using an HPLC pump. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and lightly secured in the supine position on a warming pad. Pre-warmed ultrasound transmission gel was applied to the shaved precordium according to the literature (). Transthoracic echocardiography was recorded using a Vevo 2100 cardiac ultrasound machine (GE Healthcare, USA) equipped with a 30-MHz transducer. Heart rate was monitored and was generally maintained at 400-500 beats/min during imaging. The heart was imaged in the two-dimensional mode in the parasternal long-axis and short-axis views. From these views, an M-mode cursor was positioned perpendicular to the posterior wall of the left ventricle and inter-ventricular septum at the level of the papillary muscles, and M-mode images were captured. After the scanning was finished, the gel was removed, and the mice were returned to their cages for recovery. The images were analyzed on an Echo workstation. Data are shown as mean\u00a0\u00b1 SEM and \u201cn\u201d represents the number of independent experiments.

These findings indicate that SST interneurons enable and maintain synaptic plasticity-dependent sequential activation of PNs during motor skill learning. Sequential activation of pyramidal neuron (PN) populations is believed to be important for a wide variety of brain functions, such as episodic memory formation, decision making, and motor behavior (, , , , , ). This sequential neuronal activation is characterized by distinct segregation of neuronal activities such that different neurons are active at different time periods of an animal\u2019s behavior. Although the sequential neuronal activity profile is dynamic during the process of learning (, , ), its stability increases over time and is associated with behavioral improvement and performance stereotypy (, , , ). Therefore, the establishment of stable sequential activity pattern is likely critical for information encoding and storage. Nevertheless, the mechanisms that generate and maintain learning-dependent sequential activation of PNs are poorly understood. Inhibition can control and shape activity profiles of PNs, leading to increased temporal precision and tuning in response to sensory stimuli (, , ). Network modeling suggests that the parsing of PNs into sequentially active groups depends on inhibition (, , ). Recently, a circuit motif of dis-inhibition, through activation of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing and inactivation of somatostatin (SST)-expressing GABAergic interneurons (INs), has been suggested to enable information processing and enhanced excitability of PNs (, , , , , ). Whether and how inhibition involving SST INs and VIP INs affects learning-induced sequential activities of PNs remain unknown. In addition to inhibition, network modeling studies suggest that the establishment of temporal sequence of PNs depends on spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) mechanisms (). A key concept of such STDP rules is that synaptic strength would be potentiated or de-potentiated, depending on whether the presynaptic neurons fire prior or after the postsynaptic neurons (, ). One prediction from STDP-dependent synaptic strengthening is that the firing of presynaptic neurons would cause postsynaptic neurons to fire earlier in the late phase than the initial phase of learning (, ). In support of this prediction, studies revealed a backward shift in the center of mass of the CA1 place fields () and head direction tuning curves of the anterior thalamus (). Together, these studies strongly suggest that activity-dependent synaptic plasticity is involved in establishing sequential activation of PNs. However, direct experimental evidence demonstrating the role of synaptic plasticity in the generation and maintenance of temporal sequences is lacking. In this work, we investigated the roles of inhibition and synaptic plasticity in motor learning-dependent sequential activation of layer 2 and/or 3 (L2/3) PNs in the mouse primary motor cortex (M1). We observed a temporal shift and progressive stabilization in the sequential activation of L2/3 PNs during motor skill learning. Concurrently, SST INs displayed both increases and decreases in activity during motor training. Activating SST INs directly or indirectly by inactivating VIP INs prevented the learning-dependent shift in sequential activation of PNs and the animal\u2019s behavioral improvement. On the other hand, inhibiting SST INs during the learning of a new motor task de-stabilized the sequential activity of PN population and reversed behavioral improvement established during previous learning. Furthermore, CaMKII-dependent synaptic plasticity was critically involved in the modulation of PN sequential activity by SST INs. These findings demonstrate the important roles of SST INs and synaptic plasticity in enabling and maintaining sequential activation of PNs during motor skill learning. To investigate the mechanisms underlying learning-related sequential activity of PNs, we first examined the population activity of L2/3 PNs in the M1 of head-restrained mice while they were trained to run forward on a treadmill at a fixed speed (, ; Figure\u00a01A). In this training paradigm, mice changed their gait patterns over time such that, with training, they spent higher fractions of the running epoch in structured running, as opposed to unstructured movement: drag of feet; sweep; and wobble (Figure\u00a0S1; Video S1). Significant performance improvement could be observed within 20\u00a0min of forward running (FR) training (Figures 1B\u20131D). To measure the running-related activity of L2/3 PNs, we used transgenic mice expressing a genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator (GCaMP6s) in these cells and performed two-photon Ca2+ imaging before and following 20-min FR training (Figure\u00a01A). The vast majority of PNs displayed low levels of activity when the treadmill was turned off and the animals were stationary. When the treadmill was turned on, L2/3 PNs increased their activity significantly (95% of all cells) during FR both before and after training (Figures S2A\u2013S2E). The increase of PN activity during running was transient, displaying short response durations relative to the running time (Figures 1E, 1F, and S2F; average response duration: 3.54\u00a0\u00b1 0.06\u00a0s and 3.62\u00a0\u00b1 0.07\u00a0s during pre- and post-training, respectively, in 45-s running trials). Notably, the activity of individual PNs showed variable timing relative to the movement onset such that different cells peaked their activity across running trials at different time points (for example, Figures 1E, 1F, S2G, and S2M). When the cells within an imaging plane were ordered according to the timing of their average peak activity, we observed a temporal sequence of neurons across the entire running epoch (Figures 1G, S2J, and S2K). A similar temporal sequence of neuronal activity was observed when pooling all imaging planes from all animals together (Figures 1I and S2L\u2013S2P). Previous studies have shown that, when M1 is selectively silenced, motor performance is largely intact but behavioral improvement after motor training is impaired (, , ). These findings suggest a view that motor cortex modulates the activity and plasticity of subcortical motor circuits, such as basal ganglia and spinal cord, which are directly responsible for generating rhythmic locomotor behaviors (, , , , , ). Consistently, we found that, even though mice showed repetitive movement behaviors on the treadmill, L2/3 PNs exhibited sequential rather than repetitive activation during the 45-s running period. Notably, when we compared the temporal activity profile of the same PNs before and following the 20-min FR training, we found that the temporal sequence of the population activity shifted in time such that most cells reached their peak activity earlier during the running epoch (Figures 1E\u20131L and S2G\u2013S2K). Although the timing of the peak (or onset) activity was significantly shifted (Figures 1K\u20131M), the peak values themselves remained similar following training (Figure\u00a01N). When the activities of PN population were examined after extensive training over 2\u00a0days, we found that the temporal sequence was stabilized with no additional shift in timing (Figure\u00a01O). Additionally, the rank of the cells in the sequence (i.e., the identity of the individual cells in the ordered sequence) was significantly correlated before and after a 20-min FR session (Figure\u00a01P). The temporal shift in the population sequential activity is thought to reflect synaptic potentiation important for generating new sequences during learning (, , ). Given the importance of early neuronal spikes in information processing (, , ), such a temporal shift in sequential activity may enhance information transfer from motor cortex to subcortical regions to modulate behavioral performance. Consistently, we found that the shift in the sequential activity of PNs paralleled behavioral improvements in the FR task (Figures 1C, 1D, and 1K). The temporal profile of PN sequential activity and the percent of structured running, but not wobbling, were positively correlated on a trial-by-trial basis (i.e., the more cells peaked earlier in the running trial, the more structured running performed; Figures 1Q and 1R). Taken together, these results suggest that the sequential activity, its leftward temporal shift, and stabilization may regulate the activity of subcortical circuits and facilitate structured running. What are the circuit mechanisms underlying motor learning-induced sequential activity of L2/3 PNs? SST INs target the dendrites of PNs and have been suggested to regulate the excitability and information flow of neuronal circuits (, ), specifically via a circuit motif of dis-inhibition involving VIP IN activation (, , ). To test whether SST INs are critical for motor learning-dependent sequential activation of L2/3 PNs, we first examined their responses to motor training (Figures 2A and 2B; Video S2). In contrast to the increased activity of PNs in response to FR, the activity of L2/3 SST INs in M1 was diverse, displaying both decreases below and increases above baseline activity (Figures 2C\u20132G). To further understand SST INs\u2019 response diversity, we examined whether the different responses were cell autonomous or task dependent by imaging the activity of SST INs in response to both FR and backward running (BR). SST INs\u2019 responses to BR were also diverse (Figures 2H\u20132J). Notably, when we compared the response profiles of the same SST INs to FR and BR, we found that, among the cells with significantly different response profiles (see example cells in Figures 2K\u20132M), the vast majority (75%) had an opposite polarity (Figure\u00a02N). Thus, SST INs increasing their activity during FR were likely to reduce their activity during BR (Figure\u00a02L) and vice versa (Figure\u00a02M), indicating that the diversity in SST INs\u2019 responses was largely task dependent. We further imaged SST INs after a 20-min FR training and found that most cells did not change their response profiles (76.7%; Figures S3A\u2013S3H) or their response onset time (average response onset time during pre-training: 3.51\u00a0\u00b1 0.65\u00a0s and post-training: 5.9\u00a0\u00b1 0.94 s; Figures S3I and S3J). However, the time of their peak responses was delayed (rightward shift; average peak time during pre-training: 8.59\u00a0\u00b1 0.95\u00a0s and post-training: 15.42\u00a0\u00b1 1.09 s; Figure\u00a0S3K). Because SST INs are directly connected to PNs (, , ), the rightward shift of peak SST neuronal activity following training suggests a reduction of inhibition onto PNs at the start of running trials, which could contribute to the leftward shift of PN sequential activities and animals\u2019 behavioral improvement. To test the potential role of SST INs in regulating motor learning-induced sequential activity of PNs, we imaged the running-related activity of PNs while manipulating the activity of SST INs using the designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug (DREADD) system (). Specifically, we crossed SST Cre mice with transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6s in PNs and virally infected SST INs locally within M1 with either the activating (hM3D(Gq)) or inhibiting (hM4D(Gi)) form of the DREADD. Although the DREADD/clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) system led to the expected changes in activities of SST INs and PNs (Figures 3A\u20133I and S4), modulating SST IN activity by CNO administration alone without 20\u00a0min training did not affect sequential activation of L2/3 PNs (Figures S4Q, S4U, and S4Y) or behavioral performance (Figure\u00a0S5). Notably, unlike the control condition (saline intraperitoneal [i.p.] injection; Figures 3J\u20133M), activating SST INs (CNO i.p. injection; Figure\u00a03O) during the 20-min FR training session prevented the temporal shift of the population sequence to earlier time points in the running trial (Figures 3P\u20133R) and the animals\u2019 behavioral improvement (Figure\u00a03S; compare with Figure\u00a03N). In contrast, when the activity of SST INs was inhibited (CNO i.p. injection; Figure\u00a03T) during the 20-min FR, the temporal shift in sequential activation (Figures 3U\u20133W) as well as behavioral improvement (Figure\u00a03X) were not disrupted. Together, these findings suggest that the reduction in SST IN activity during motor training is important for enabling learning-induced sequential activation of PNs and performance improvement. Because SST IN activity was not uniformly reduced during motor learning and inhibiting SST INs did not prevent the leftward temporal shift in the sequential activation of PNs or the behavior improvement, the role of SST INs\u2019 active inhibition remained unclear. Recent studies have shown that global deletion of SST INs resulted in the interference of previously learned skills by new learning (). Because FR and BR training induced largely opposite activity patterns in SST INs (Figure\u00a02), this raised the possibility that the inhibitory activity of SST INs during one motor learning task may be involved in protecting the sequential activation pattern of PN populations induced by a different motor learning task. To test this possibility, we first imaged the activity of PNs before and following a 20-min FR training session to establish the initial leftward temporal shift. Subsequently, animals received either saline injection or CNO injection to inhibit the activity of SST INs (DREADD hM4D(Gi)), followed by an additional 20-min training session in which mice were trained with the same FR task or a new task, BR. Finally, the activity of the same PNs in response to FR was imaged to determine the stability of the sequential activation pattern of PNs established in response to the initial FR training (Figure\u00a04A). In control mice receiving saline injection, the leftward temporal shift in the population sequential activation after FR training (Figures 4B\u20134D) was maintained following BR training (Figures 4E\u20134H). In parallel, the animals increased the percent of time spent in structured running following FR training, and this increase was also maintained after BR training (Figure\u00a04I). In contrast, in mice injected with CNO to inhibit the activity of SST INs during the introduction of BR training (Figure\u00a04J), the initial leftward shift in the population temporal sequence as well as behavioral improvement were reversed (Figures 4K\u20134Q). Notably, in mice injected with CNO to inhibit the activity of SST INs during a second FR training, the initial temporal shift in the population activity and behavioral improvement were maintained (Figures 4R\u20134Y). Taken together, the findings above suggest that active inhibition of SST INs during motor skill learning is important for preventing the de-stabilization of previously learned sequential activation pattern and for maintaining behavioral improvement when a new motor skill task is introduced. It has been suggested that, during active sensation and complex behaviors, VIP INs are activated to inhibit SST INs, which in turn lead to dis-inhibition of PNs and potentially the induction of plasticity during learning (, ). Consistent with this notion, we found that VIP INs were stereotypically and significantly activated in response to FR and BR (Figures 5A\u20135D). Inhibiting the activity of VIP INs (Figures 5E\u20135H) during the 20-min FR training prevented the temporal shift in sequential activation and animals\u2019 behavioral improvement (Figures 5I\u20135Q). Because VIP INs exert strong inhibition onto SST INs (, ), this finding is in\u00a0line with the impact of increased SST IN activity on preventing\u00a0learning-induced sequential activation and performance improvement (Figure\u00a03). Furthermore, when we reduced the activity of VIP INs during the introduction of the new BR (Figure\u00a05R), the changes in sequential activity and behavior improvement that occurred in response to initial FR training were still maintained (Figures 5S and 5T). This finding is also in line with the importance of active SST IN inhibition for maintaining previously learned sequential activation pattern and behavioral improvement when a new motor skill task is introduced (Figure\u00a04). Taken together, these results suggest that VIP IN activity (likely by inhibiting SST INs) is important for enabling, but not maintaining, learning-induced sequential activity of PNs and behavioral improvement. Computational neural network models have suggested a critical role for synaptic plasticity in the emergence of sequential activity patterns of PNs and their temporal shift (, , , ). Additionally, SST INs, which directly target the dendrites of PNs (, ), have been shown to control Ca2+ signals at individual L2/3 pyramidal dendritic spines () as well as dendritic Ca2+ spikes associated with synaptic plasticity (, ). To investigate whether synaptic plasticity is involved in SST IN-dependent sequential activity of PNs, we first imaged Ca2+ activity of dendritic spines on apical dendrites of L2/3 PNs in M1 with or without manipulating the activity of SST INs (Figures 6A\u20136C and S6A\u2013S6F; Video S3). Ca2+ activity of spines (but not dendritic shafts) was significantly different following 20-min FR training (for spines; Figure\u00a06D; for dendritic shaft, paired Wilcoxon rank sum; U\u00a0= 0.8; p\u00a0= 0.3; 48 dendrites). When SST INs were activated by CNO/DREADD hM3D(Gq) during FR training, spine Ca2+ activity was comparable before and after training (Figures 6E and 6F). Thus, FR training resulted in changes in synaptic activities that were blocked by the elevation of SST IN activity. We further examined whether changes in spine Ca2+ activity occurring in response to FR training would be sustained following either FR or BR training while SST INs were inhibited by CNO/DREADD hM4D(Gi) (Figure\u00a06G). Under the control condition, changes in spine activity following FR training were maintained following the introduction of new BR task (Figures 6H and 6I). However, when SST INs were inhibited during BR training, changes in spine activity that occurred initially following FR training were reversed following BR training (Figures 6J and 6K). On the other hand, when SST INs were inhibited during a second FR training, the initial changes in spine activity were maintained (Figures 6J and 6L). Taken together, these changes in dendritic spine Ca2+ activity suggest that synaptic plasticity likely occurs in learning-induced sequential activation of PNs. In addition to spine changes described above, we also found that activating or inhibiting SST INs by CNO/DREADD alone, without 20-min training, significantly reduced or increased, respectively, the frequency of FR-related dendritic shafts Ca2+ activity (Figures S6G and S6H). Additionally, when SST INs were inhibited, dendrites active to FR were more likely active also to BR (Figures S6I\u2013S6K). Because SST INs directly target pyramidal dendrites and spines (, , , ), these results suggest that increased and decreased SST IN inhibition may modulate dendritic spine activity either directly or indirectly by affecting the frequency and location of dendritic Ca2+ signaling important for synaptic plasticity. To directly test the involvement of synaptic plasticity in SST IN-dependent sequential activation and stabilization of L2/3 PNs, we manipulated the activity of calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), a key signaling molecule in regulating synaptic plasticity (, ). In this experiment, we locally infused CaMKII inhibitors (KN-62 and KN-93; ), or a negative control (KN-92), into M1 prior to 20-min FR training (Figures 7A, 7B, and S7). The CaMKII inhibitors, but not the negative control, abolished the temporal shift in sequential activity (Figures 7C and 7E) and behavioral improvement following training (Figures 7D and 7F). We also tested whether synaptic plasticity is involved in SST IN-dependent de-stabilization of sequential activation. In this experiment, we inhibited SST INs (CNO/DREADD hM4D(Gi)) and infused a CaMKII inhibitor (KN-62) when introducing BR (Figures 7G and 7H). The leftward shift in the population activity following the initial 20-min FR training was now maintained following the introduction of BR (Figures 7I and 7J; and compare with Figures 4K\u20134N). Together, these findings suggest that the\u00a0establishment and maintenance of learning-dependent sequential activities of PNs involve CaMKII-dependent synaptic plasticity. In the experiments above, the pharmacological inhibitors (KNs) were applied locally in M1 and blocked CaMKII activities in all cell types. We therefore used a genetically encoded light-inducible inhibitor of CaMKII (paAIP2) to block CaMKII activity specifically in PNs and only during treadmill training (). In\u00a0vitro photoactivation of this inhibitor has been shown to acutely block the induction of long-term synaptic plasticity of dendritic spines (). The CaMKII inhibitor, but not the non-functional mutant, blocked the temporal shift in the population sequential activity and the animals\u2019 behavioral improvement following training (Figures 8A\u20138I). Additionally, the CaMKII inhibitor, but not the non-functional mutant, blocked SST IN-dependent de-stabilization of sequential activation (Figures 8J\u20138Q). Together, these findings with pharmacological and optogenetic approaches suggest that SST IN-dependent temporal shift in the sequential activity of PNs requires CaMKII-dependent synaptic plasticity. They also suggest that active inhibition by SST INs is important for reducing synaptic plasticity and stabilizing learning-dependent changes of sequential activation during subsequent new motor skill learning. Learning-dependent sequential activation of neuronal population is associated with behavioral improvement, but the mechanisms underlying its generation and stabilization remain unclear. By imaging the activities of PNs and SST INs in the mouse M1, we show rapid establishment of the temporal sequence of L2/3 PNs while SST INs exhibit increases and decreases in activities during motor skill learning. Furthermore, using chemogenetic, optogenetic, and pharmacological approaches to manipulate SST IN, VIP IN, and CaMKII activities, we reveal that the emergence and maintenance of learning-dependent sequential activation of PNs are controlled by SST INs and CaMKII-dependent synaptic plasticity. Sequential activation patterns of neurons have been observed in various brain regions and behavioral states (, , , , ). Indeed, the sequential activity profile can be generated in response to sensory stimuli during motor actions and sleep replay (, ) and is dynamic over minutes to weeks (, , , ). The ability of the brain to generate sequential activities switching from one co-activated group of neurons to the next is likely critical for information transfer, memory consolidation, and animals\u2019 behaviors (, ). Although inhibitory circuits have powerful control over a variety of brain functions (, , , ), the involvement of inhibition in the generation and maintenance of sequential neuronal activities is not clear. Previous studies have established a role for VIP INs and SST INs in information flow in the pyramidal neuronal circuit during sensory processing and learning. Specifically, a canonical circuit in cortical and subcortical regions was described, whereby activated VIP INs lead to the dis-inhibition of PNs via inactivation of SST INs during active sensation and reward-guided tasks (, , , ). Our results support a role for this circuit motif in learning-dependent sequential activity of PNs. In line with the suggested microcircuit, we found that increasing, but not decreasing, SST IN activity either directly with the DREADD approach or indirectly via inhibition of VIP INs, prevents the temporal shift of PNs\u2019 sequential activity and behavioral improvement. Without training, increasing or reducing SST IN activity alone did not induce the temporal shift or the behavioral improvement. Together, these results suggest that VIP INs inhibit SST INs, which in turn dis-inhibit PNs to enable motor learning-induced sequential activity of PNs and behavioral improvement. In addition to the roles of SST INs and VIP INs in enabling learning-induced sequential activation, we also found that previously established temporal sequence would be de-stabilized when mice were trained with a new task and SST IN activity was inhibited with the DREADD system. This effect of reducing SST IN activity on temporal sequence de-stabilization only occurred when the new BR task, but not the previous FR task, was introduced. This finding indicates that, without the inhibition from SST INs, new learning would alter existing sequential activity patterns of L2/3 PNs. Consistently, when we inhibited VIP IN activity while introducing new BR motor training, the initial FR-related changes in sequential activity and behavior improvement were not interfered. Together, these results suggest an important role of increased SST IN inhibition in protecting and stabilizing the previously formed sequential activity profile and behavioral improvement. Unlike a rather uniform reduction in SST IN activity in sensory cortices (, , ), our results show that SST INs in L2/3 of M1 display both reduced and elevated activities in response to FR and BR. Because nearly all VIP INs exhibit increased activity to both FR and BR, VIP INs are likely responsible for the decrease, but not increase, in SST IN activity. We found that individual SST INs exhibit different and opposite activity patterns in response to different motor learning tasks, suggesting that motor-task-specific inputs are important for the increased SST IN activity. Taken together, these findings suggest that VIP INs provide global inhibition to SST INs and reduce their activity for learning-dependent sequence emergence, and excitatory inputs may increase the activity of SST INs in a task-related manner for protecting the recently formed sequential activity pattern of PNs. Our results thus point to the dual functions of SST INs in the motor cortex: on the one hand, dis-inhibition of SST INs facilitates the information flow and learning-dependent sequence emergence. On the other hand, increased SST IN inhibition protects the previously formed sequential activity profile. Our study indicates that SST INs and synaptic plasticity are two important components for enabling and maintaining learning-dependent sequential activity patterns. SST INs send extensive axonal projections to L1, where they contact apical dendrites of PNs (). They directly block the initiation of dendritic Ca2+ spikes occurring in response to sensory stimuli () and disrupt branch-specific Ca2+ spikes during motor skill training in L5 PNs (). Additionally, SST INs exert a high level of spatial precision controlling Ca2+ signals at the level of individual L2/3 pyramidal dendritic spines (). Consistent with these studies, we found that SST INs control the frequency and motor task specificity of L2/3 pyramidal dendritic Ca2+ activity, suggesting that reduced SST IN activity may increase dendritic Ca2+ activity to promote synaptic plasticity during new learning, and increased SST IN activity may reduce dendritic Ca2+ activity to protect synaptic plasticity established earlier. It\u00a0is thus possible that dis-inhibition and inhibition from SST INs promote and prevent synaptic changes of L2/3 PNs via Ca2+ spike-timing-dependent mechanisms. Future studies are needed to better understand the link between SST IN activity and dendritic Ca2+ signaling in regulating motor learning-induced plasticity and maintenance of sequential activity. Furthermore, in our study, the sequential activity of PNs corresponds to repetitive running action spanning tens of seconds, whereas in previous work, sequential activity was observed in M1 during a single, typically 1-s-long, motor action (). Future studies are also needed to investigate whether similar Ca2+ spike-timing-dependent mechanisms are responsible for generating and maintaining sequential activities of PNs under different motor learning paradigms. Computational modeling studies have demonstrated that a randomly connected network can produce sequential activity patterns based on the plasticity of synaptic weights (, , ). They also suggest a critical role of the asymmetric STDP rules in the temporal sequence generation and predicted a learning-dependent shift of the temporal sequence (, ). Rapid establishment and temporal shift of sequential activities have been observed in CA1 place fields and head-directional cell tuning curves in the thalamus (, ), as well as in our studies of L2/3 PNs in M1, suggesting that common STDP mechanisms may underlie the generation of learned sequences. Activated CaMKII has been shown to be both sufficient and necessary for long-term potentiation induction and for certain forms of learning and memory (, ). Our results of blocking CaMKII activities provide strong experimental evidence for a critical role of synaptic plasticity in the generation and de-stabilization of learning-dependent sequential activation of PNs. In addition to pharmacological reagents, we blocked CaMKII activity during treadmill training with a genetically encoded light-inducible inhibitor of CaMKII, which enabled us to inhibit CaMKII activity acutely and specifically in PNs and to potently target only CaMKII (). It will be of interest to use this novel approach to investigate whether learning-dependent sequential activation and stabilization in other brain regions also involve CaMKII-dependent synaptic plasticity. Lastly, although our studies reveal the roles of inhibition and\u00a0synaptic plasticity in generating and maintaining learning-dependent sequential activity of L2/3 PNs in the M1, the precise functions of this sequential activity and its temporal shift in the context of motor behaviors remain to be further investigated. Recent studies have shown that the motor cortex is not required for locomotion or execution of the learned skills but is essential for generating plasticity in downstream motor circuits during learning (, , ). Based on previous work, our results, and the fact that L2/3 PNs are several synapses away from the muscle motor output, it is likely that the sequential activity of L2/3 PNs only modulates, rather than determines, the activity and plasticity in the basal ganglia and spinal cord for motor performance. Furthermore, given the importance of early neuronal spikes in information processing (, , ), it is possible that the leftward shift in sequential activity enhances information transfer from M1 to subcortical regions, perhaps for earlier anticipatory adjustments of posture and motor preparation. Consistent with this view, we observed that the temporal profile of the sequence and the percent structured running performed by the animals were correlated on a trial-by-trial basis. However, it should be noted that, when we examined each session independently, we found that the temporal pattern of the sequence and structured running were significantly correlated only after, but not before, the 20-min FR training (Figure\u00a0S8). The population activity of L2/3 PNs showed reduced variability with training, specifically by stabilization of the temporal pattern and the order of the sequence post-2-day training. Based on our findings and in line with previous studies (, ), we speculate that, during the initial training phase, multiple activity patterns of PNs in the M1 can lead to a similar behavioral motor output. The temporal shift and reduced variability in sequential activity occur with training, leading to a more consistent behavioral output. Future studies are needed to manipulate sequential activity of L2/3 PNs directly to better understand its role in reducing the variability of behavioral output and in behavior improvement during motor learning.

Transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6s in PNs (Thy1.2-GCaMP6s Line 3) and Cre recombinase in SST INs (SST-IRES-Cre) or in VIP INs (VIP-IRES-Cre) were group-housed (5 per cage) in the Parasitology Central Animal Facility or in the Smilow Animal Facility at New York University Medical Center. SST-IRES-Cre (Ssttm2.1(cre)Zjh) and VIP-IRES-Cre (Viptm1(cre)Zjh) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories. Mice were maintained at 22\u00b0C\u00a0\u00b1 2\u00b0C with a 12-h light: dark cycle. All experiments were conducted during the light cycle between 08:00-18:00. Food and water were available at libitum. 1-1.5\u00a0month-old animals of both sexes were used for all the experiments in accordance with ethical regulations and the New York University Medical Center (NYUMC) guidelines, and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at NYUMC. No association was found between animals\u2019 sex and experimental results. Animals were trained to perform a treadmill motor task in which head-fixed mice were forced to run (forward or backward) at fix speed (8\u00a0cm/s or 4cm/s respectively) on a free-floating treadmill (, ). Animals were positioned on a custom-made head holder/body support device that allowed the micro-metal bars (attached to the animal\u2019s skull) to be mounted so that the mouse forelimbs were positioned on top of the treadmill belt and its head was below the microscope objective (). Mice were allowed to only move their forelimbs for locomotion to minimize motion artifacts in the images during treadmill running. Therefore, only the forelimb region of M1 was imaged, and the movement of forelimbs was monitored. The free-floating treadmill (96\u00a0cm \u00d7 56\u00a0cm \u00d7 61\u00a0cm dimensions) was custom built such that it could fit into the imaging apparatus (, ). The treadmill belt was cut out of black rubber sheets (0.031\u2019\u2019) and was connected to a motor (Dayton, Model 2L010, Grainger, USA) driven by a DC power supply (Extech; Calgary, Canada). The treadmill belt was mounted on top of a metal frame. The treadmill itself and all its supporting units were not in contact with either the microscope stage or the supporting air table. During motor training and at the onset of a running trial, the motor was turned on and the belt speed gradually increased from 0\u00a0cm/s to 8\u00a0cm/s within \u223c3 s. The speed of 8\u00a0cm/s was kept for the rest of the trial as the animals were forced to run. Each running trial lasted 45\u00a0s (or 30\u00a0s for imaging of SST and VIP INs) followed by an inter-trial interval (ITI, treadmill turned off) of 15 s. During the ITI the treadmill was turned off and the animals were stationary, and during the trial the treadmill was turned on and the animals were forced to run throughout the entire period (45 s). Treadmill training was performed in 20\u00a0min session blocks and testing was performed based on a minimum of 4 trials per session. To assay gait patterns, mouse forelimbs were first coated into ink (Speedball, Stateville, NC, USA) before running on white construction paper. Animals running on the treadmill produce four distinct characteristic gait patterns which are identifiable from forelimb ink prints on white construction paper (Figure\u00a0S1). These gait patterns include: drag, wobble, sweep, and steady run. During drag, mice fail to execute steps resulting in their forelimbs being dragged on the treadmill belt thus producing a smearing of ink on the paper in the running direction (in the direction of the moving treadmill belt). During wobble, mice lose their balance and make many disorganized chaotic steps thus producing a highly variable ink pattern both in the running direction and lateral to running direction. During sweep, mice make steps lateral to the running direction thus producing ink marks that are perpendicular to the running direction. Finally, during steady run, mice make distinct steps in the running direction thus producing relatively evenly spaced distinct ink marks centered in the direction of running. Consistent with previous studies (, ), the distribution of gait patterns changed with training, such that during pre-training condition in early FR trials mice spent a higher fraction of the running trials performing drag (29.68%\u00a0\u00b1 3.65%), wobble (22.94%\u00a0\u00b1 1.95%) and sweep (13.13%\u00a0\u00b1 1.31%) gait patterns (total of 65.77%\u00a0\u00b1 3.78%) compared with steady run (34.22%\u00a0\u00b1 3.78%). However, with training mice improve and refine their gait patterns:\u00a0switching from drag (6.58%\u00a0\u00b1 1.32%), wobble (5.31%\u00a0\u00b1 0.86%) and sweep (5.14%\u00a0\u00b1 0.82%) gait patterns (total of 17.04\u00a0\u00b1 1.83) into steady run (82.95%\u00a0\u00b1 1.83%) as the prevalent gait pattern (Figures 1B and S1). Since the steady structured running is a strong indication of behavioral improvement, we have used the percent of time animals spent in structured running and the stride width to describe animals\u2019 behavior. When mice performed structured running, their step sizes (within limb stride distance) ranged from 1.5-2\u00a0cm (25%\u201375% of stride distance distribution across animals) at the speed of \u223c4-5.5 running steps per second. However, this periodicity was disrupted by other un-structured gait patterns, especially during pre-training. Previous studies have suggested that this treadmill motor task involves motor skill learning as other motor learning tasks. First, similar to rotarod training and single-pellet reaching tasks, mice subjected to the treadmill running demonstrated rapid (over hours) and slow (over days) phases of behavioral improvement as measured by the percent of time spent in structured running and by the structured running stride width before and after treadmill training (). Second, the behavioral improvement is abolished if treadmill training is executed in the presence of muscimol in the primary motor cortex (M1) (). Third, treadmill training induces rapid new spine formation similar to rotarod training and single-pellet reaching tasks (). We performed Ca2+ imaging in awake, head restrained mice through a cranial window. 24\u00a0h prior to imaging, mice underwent surgery to attach a head holder and to create either an open-skull or a thinned-skull cranial window as previously described (). Specifically, mice were deeply anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100\u00a0\u03bcg/g) and xylazine (10\u00a0\u03bcg/g). The mouse head was shaved and the skull surface was exposed with a midline scalp incision. The periosteum tissue over the skull surface was removed without damaging the temporal and occipital muscles. Two parallel micro-metal bars were attached to the animal\u2019s skull to serve as the head holder to help restrain the animal\u2019s head and reduce motion-induced artifact during imaging. A skull region of \u223c0.2\u00a0mm in diameter, was located over the primary motor cortex based on stereotactic coordinates (at 0.2\u00a0mm anterior to bregma and 1.2\u00a0mm lateral to midline) and marked with a pen (). A thin layer of cyanoacrylate-based glue was first applied to the top of the entire skull surface. Next the head holder was mounted with dental acrylic cement (Lang Dental Manufacturing Co., IL, USA) such that the marked skull region was exposed between the two bars. The marked region for imaging was kept exposed, uncovered with dental acrylic cement. Next, we created the cranial window over the marked region. After the dental cement was completely dry, the head holder was screwed to two metal cubes that were attached to a solid metal base. A high-speed drill was used to carefully reduce the skull thickness under a dissecting microscope (skull thickness \u223c20\u03bcm). The skull was immersed in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) during drilling. For open skull preparation a small circular craniotomy (1.0-1.5\u00a0mm diameter) was made and covered with a round glass coverslip (World Precision Instruments, coverslips, 5\u00a0mm diameter) custom to the size of the bone removed. The coverslip was glued to the skull to reduce motion of the exposed brain. Before imaging, mice were given 1\u00a0day to recover from the surgery related anesthesia and habituated for a few times (10\u00a0min each) in the imaging apparatus to minimize potential stress effects due to head restraining and awake imaging. Genetically-encoded Ca2+ indicator, GCaMP6 was used for Ca2+ imaging of somas, dendrites, and spines of L2/3 PNs and of somas of L2/3 SST-expressing and VIP-expressing INs in the primary motor cortex. Transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6s under the control of Thy1 promoter were used for imaging somas of L2/3 PNs. In all other experiments GCaMP6 was expressed with recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). In experiments in which we imaged dendrites/spines of L2/3 PNs, GCaMP6s was expressed with recombinant AAV under the human sysnapsin-1 promoter (AAV-syn-GCaMP6s; serotype 2/1; >2\u00a0\u00d7 1013 (GC/ml) titer; produced by the University of Pennsylvania Gene Therapy Program Vector Core). 0.2\u00a0\u03bcl of AAV virus was diluted 5X in ACSF (or in conjuncture with other viruses) and injected (Picospritzer III; 20 p.s.i., 20\u00a0ms, 0.2\u00a0Hz) into L2/3 (depth of 200-400\u00a0\u03bcm) of the primary motor cortex using a glass microelectrode around the coordinate of 0.3\u00a0cm anterior and 1.5\u00a0cm lateral to bregma (). The glass microelectrode was advanced into the brain using a micromanipulator (M3301 World Precision Instruments), at a 60 degree angle relative to the skull surface. The virus dilution allowed better spread through L2/3 and sparse neuronal labeling. We examined the distribution of viral infection across layers using histology in some of the animals. GCaMP infected cells were distributed across cortical layers with 4.7%\u00a0\u00b1 1.7% of cells located within 0-100\u03bcm, 30.9%\u00a0\u00b1 6.8% of cells located within 100-200\u03bcm, 30.3%\u00a0\u00b1 4.8% of cells located within 200-300\u03bcm, 17.9%\u00a0\u00b1 4.8% of cells located within 300-400\u03bcm, 8.4%\u00a0\u00b1 5.2% located within 400-500\u03bcm, 4.6%\u00a0\u00b1 3.1% located within 500-600\u03bcm and 2.8%\u00a0\u00b1 2.7% located > 600\u03bcm (numbers are averages\u00a0\u00b1 s.e.m for 7 animals). Thus, the vast majority of infected cells were in layers 2/3. Proper targeting of L2/3 neurons by AAV infection was ascertained via Zstack imaging across L1-5 at the end of the experiments. Dendrites of PNs in L1 were ascertained via spine morphology. In experiments in which we imaged somas of L2/3 SST-expressing or VIP-expressing INs, a Cre-dependent AAV-GCaMP6m (AAV-CAG-Flex-GCaMP6m or AAV-syn-Flex-GCaMP6m; serotype 2/1; >2\u00a0\u00d7 1013 (GC/ml) titer) was injected into SST-IRES-Cre or VIP-IRES-Cre mice which expressed Cre recombinase exclusively in SST-expressing or VIP-expressing INs, respectively. Mice were injected at post-natal day 21 and imaged 14\u00a0days later. In\u00a0vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging of motor cortex was done at the depth of 200-350\u00a0\u03bcm below the pial surface for detecting L2/3 somas of PNs and SST-expressing or VIP-expressing INs and at the depth of 20-70\u00a0\u03bcm below the pial surface for detecting apical dendrites and spines of L2/3 PNs. In each animal, time-lapse imaging was performed at one focal plane for PNs and at one to three focal planes for SST/VIP INs. Imaging was performed with an Olympus Fluoview 1000 two-photon system (tuned to 920\u00a0nm) equipped with a Ti:Sapphire laser (MaiTai DeepSee, Spectra Physics). The average laser power on the tissue sample was \u223c5\u201315 and 20-30\u00a0mW for imaging in L1 and L2/3 of the cortex respectively. All experiments were performed using a 25X objective (N.A. 1.1) immersed in ACSF solution and with a 2X (soma) and 5X (dendrites) digital zoom. All images were acquired at frame rates of 2\u00a0Hz (2-\u03bcs pixel dwell time). The duration of imaging and number of repetitions were kept to a minimum that enabled us to perform the experiments from one hand but did not cause photo damage on the other (). Typical imaging window for Ca2+ imaging of neuronal somas was \u223c322\u00a0\u03bcm by 161\u00a0\u03bcm and of tuft dendrites was \u223c129\u00a0\u03bcm by 65\u00a0\u03bcm. Image acquisition was performed using FV10-ASW v.2.0 software and analyzed post hoc using NIH ImageJ and MATLAB (Mathworks) software. Two weeks prior to Ca2+ imaging, Cre-dependent DREADD-hM4D(Gi) or DREADD-hM3D(Gq) virus (AAV-hsyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)mCherry or AAV-hsyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)mCherry; serotype 2; >1012 (GC/ml) titer; produced by University of North Carolina Vector Core) was injected into SST-IRES-Cre mice or SST-IRES-Cre crossed with Thy1-GCaMP6s mice which express Cre exclusively in SST INs. 0.2\u00a0\u03bcl of AAV virus was diluted 3X in ACSF (or in conjuncture with other viruses) and injected into layer 2 and/or 3 (depth of 200-400\u00a0\u03bcm) of the primary motor cortex as described above. Activation of the DREADD system was done by an intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of Clozapine N-oxide (CNO, C0832, Sigma Aldrich). CNO was dissolved in saline to a concentration of 0.5\u00a0mg/ml. Imaging and behavioral experiments were conducted prior to and 20\u00a0min following CNO administration (0.3\u00a0ml/30\u00a0g body weight) to allow activation of the DREADD system. DREADD infection levels in SST INs were determined by counting the number of SST-mCherry positive somas (Figures 3A and 3B). Since the mCherry tag of the virus produced weak fluorescence expression, we performed immunostaining of the brain slices for detecting mCherry fluorescence. SST-IRES-Cre animals injected with Cre-dependent DREADD-hM4D(Gi) were anesthetized and perfused with 20\u00a0mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS) two weeks post injection. Brain tissue was removed and fixed for 1\u00a0h in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4\u00b0C. Tissue was rinsed three times with PBS, embedded in 2% agarose, and sectioned at 200\u00a0\u03bcm with a vibratome. Sections were permeabilized in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 3\u00a0h and blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 1 h. Sections were incubated overnight with primary antibody against RFP (Rockland Immunochemicals, 1:750 #600401379; ). Sections were then washed three times with PBS/0.05% Tween-20, and then incubated with Alexa Fluor-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Life Technologies, 1:500) in PBS for 2 h. Sections were washed as before and mounted for imaging. Confocal images were obtained on a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope (10X air objective; numerical aperture, 0.8). Somas were confined to M1 (based on the mouse brain atlas) and were counted manually post hoc using ImageJ software. DREADD manipulation efficacy in SST INs was determined by Ca2+ imaging of SST somas (Figures 3C\u20133I and S4A\u2013S4H). In this experiment, two viruses (AAV2/1-syn-Flex-GCaMP6m and AAV2-hsyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)mcherry or AAV2-hsyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)mcherry) were mixed at equal volumes and injected into the primary motor cortex of SST-IRES-Cre mice. We imaged the same cells before CNO administration, 20-minute and 40-minute following CNO administration. To characterize the activity of SST INs, we examined the level of Ca2+ activity during quiet awake (\u201cresting\u201d) and running periods. We also examined the effect of the DREADD manipulation in SST INs on the activity of PNs (Figures S4L\u2013S4U). In this experiment we injected AAV2-hsyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)mcherry or AAV2-hsyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)mcherry in SST-IRES-Cre mice crossed with Thy1-GCaMP6s mice. We imaged the activity of the same PNs before CNO administration, 20-minute and 40-minute following CNO administration. In addition to examining the level of Ca2+ activity as described above for SST INs, we also examined the time of the peak activities. To control for the acute effect of CNO administration, we examined the activities of SST INs and PNs as described above in SST-IRES-Cre mice not injected with DREADD before and 20-minute after CNO administration (Figures S4I\u2013S4K for SST INs and Figures S4V\u2013S4Y for PNs). We also compared the animals\u2019 behavior before and after CNO administration in SST-IRES-Cre naive mice or SST-IRES-Cre mice injected with AAV2-hsyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)mcherry or AAV2-hsyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)mcherry (Figure\u00a0S5). Two weeks prior to Ca2+ imaging and behavioral testing, Cre-dependent PSAM (Pharmacogenetically Selective Actuator Module) () virus (AAV2-syn-CAG-Flex-PSAM-2A-EGFP, Produced by University of Pennsylvania Vector Core) was injected into VIP-IRES-Cre mice which express Cre exclusively in VIP-expressing cells. 0.2\u00a0\u03bcl of AAV virus was injected into layer 2 and/or 3 of M1 as described above. Activation of the PSAM was done by local application of PSEM308 (Pharmacogenetically Selective Effector Module) (150\u00a0\u03bcM dissolved in ACSF) to the superficial layer of M1 through the cranial window. PSEM308 delivery was made by removing the glass coverslip covering the cranial window. PSEM308 was allowed to diffuse for 10\u00a0min, and then washed with ACSF. The glass coverslip was glued back to the skull followed by imaging or behavioral testing. Imaging and behavioral testing were conducted prior to and 10\u00a0min following PSEM308 application to allow activation of the PSAM system. PSAM infection levels in VIP neurons were determined by counting the number of VIP-GFP positive somas (Figures 5E and 5F). For better detection of fluorescence expression of EGFP, we performed immunostaining of the brain slices with the primary antibody against GFP (Abcam 1:500) and goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Invitrogen 1:500). PSAM manipulation efficacy in VIP neurons was determined by Ca2+ imaging of VIP somas (Figures 5G and 5H). In this experiment, two viruses (AAV1-syn-flex-NES-JRGECO1a and AAV2-syn-CAG-Flex-PSAM-2A-EGFP) were mixed at equal volumes and injected into the M1 of VIP-IRES-Cre mice. We imaged the same cells before PSEM308 administration and 10-minute following PSEM308 application. Imaging was performed with an Olympus Fluoview 1000 two-photon system tuned to 1020\u00a0nm, equipped with a Ti:Sapphire laser (MaiTai DeepSee, Spectra Physics). To characterize the activity of VIP INs, we examined the level of Ca2 activity during running. We also examined the effect of the PSAM manipulation in VIP INs on the activity of PNs (Figures 5I and 5J). In this experiment we injected AAV2-syn-CAG-Flex-PSAM-2A-EGFP in VIP-IRES-Cre mice crossed with Thy1-GCaMP6s mice. We imaged the activity of the same PNs before PSEM308 administration and 10-minute following PSEM308 application. To characterize the cell activities, we examined the level of Ca2 activity during running and the time of the Ca2+ peak activities. Finally, to determine the acute effect of PSEM308 administration we also compared the animals\u2019 behavior before and after PSEM308 administration in VIP-IRES-Cre mice injected with AAV2-syn-CAG-Flex-PSAM-2A-EGFP (Figure\u00a05K). 3-4\u00a0weeks prior to Ca2+ imaging, a light-inducible CaMKII inhibitor (AAV9-CaMKIIp-mEGFP-P2A-paAIP2, produced by Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience) or non-functional mutant control (AAV9-CaMKIIp-mEGFP-P2A-paAIP2(R5A/R6A)) virus () was injected into SST-IRES-Cre mice. The virus was injected into layer 2 and/or 3 of M1 as described above in conjecture with red genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator RGECO (AAV1-syn-NES-JRGECO1a; produced by the University of Pennsylvania Gene Therapy Program Vector Core). For the experiments described in Figures 8J\u20138Q the animals were also injected with Cre-dependent DREADD-hM4D(Gi) (AAV-hsyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)mCherry) with a separate second injection into the same location. Imaging was performed with an Olympus Fluoview 1000 two-photon system tuned to 1020\u00a0nm, equipped with a Ti:Sapphire laser (MaiTai DeepSee, Spectra Physics). PaAIP2 inhibits CaMKII activity in a blue-light-dependent manner. Blue light illumination was done via the arc-lamp or LED laser (Thor Labs, LED 1B, M470F3, 470nm, 20mW) directly on top of the open skull imaging region only during treadmill training and not during neuronal imaging or behavioral testing. During FR/BR training session, blue light was illuminated for 10\u00a0s every 1\u00a0min over the course of 20\u00a0min. Neuronal activity and behavioral performance were tested before and after the 20-minute training session (without blue light illumination). CaMKII inhibitors KN-62 (I2142, Sigma Aldrich), and KN-93 (K1385, Sigma Aldrich), and control KN-92 (sc-311369, Santa Cruz Biotehcnology) were applied to the cortex at the concentration of 10\u00a0\u03bcM in ACSF. They were first dissolved in DMSO and then diluted in ACSF with a final DMSO concentration of\u00a0< 0.1%. CaMKII inhibitors and control were applied to the superficial layer of the M1 through the cranial window. Drug delivery was made as described above for PSEM308. Drugs were allowed to diffuse for 10\u00a0min, and then washed with ACSF. We estimated the extent and time course of CaMKII inhibitors and control diffusion by applying Rhodamine B isothiocyanate-Dextran (Sigma, Lot #SLBS1075V, 1mg in 300\u00a0mL ACSF), and imaging the spread across cortical layers over 20\u00a0min after drug application. Rhodamine B isothiocyanate-Dextran spread was estimated according to the fluorescence spread normalized to its peak level (brain surface). The fluorescence dropped to 50% at 235\u00a0\u00b1 16\u00a0\u03bcm and remained unchanged following 20\u00a0min (Wilcoxon rank sum, U\u00a0= \u22121.68\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.09, 3 animals). We examined the acute effects of the CaMKII inhibitors and control on PNs\u2019 activity and animals\u2019 behavior by comparing the cells\u2019 activity and animals\u2019 behavior before and following drug application (Figure\u00a0S7), as described above for CNO. During running trials, the lateral movement of the images was typically less than 1\u00a0\u03bcm. Vertical movements were infrequent and minimized due to flexible belt design, two micro-metal bars attached to the animal\u2019s skull (described above) by dental acrylic, and a custom-built body support to minimize spinal cord movements generated by the hind limbs. All time-lapse images from each individual field of view were motion corrected and referenced to a single template frame using cross-correlation image alignment (TurboReg [] plugin for ImageJ). Regions-of-interests (ROIs) corresponding to visually identifiable somas, spines or apical tuft dendrites were selected manually. Somas, dendrites and spines that could be identified in all imaging sessions were included in the dataset. Our dataset therefore excludes neurons that did not show any fluorescence transients during any of the imaging sessions. All the pixels inside the ROI were averaged to obtain a time-series fluorescence trace for each ROI. This process was done automatically for somas using custom code in MATLAB and manually for spines and dendrites. The manual extraction of fluorescence signal from spines and dendrites was done to overcome contamination of the signal in these small structures by nearby structures due to remaining small lateral movements of the images. Data extraction was done blind to experimental group. Background fluorescence was calculated as the average over the 5th percentile pixel value per frame and subtracted from the time-series fluorescence traces. The baseline (F0) of the fluorescence trace was estimated by detecting inactive portions of the trace using an iterative procedure (). Briefly, we smoothed (loess, 1\u00a0min moving average) the raw fluorescence trace and subtracted the smooth trace from the raw trace, denoted as preliminary F0. Two times the standard deviation of the preliminary F0 trace was set as a threshold for detecting inactive portions in the raw fluorescence trace. The inactive portions were concatenated and the procedure was repeated once again. The resulting inactive portions were then placed according to their original time points and values were linearly interpolated across the gaps of the active portions yielding the F0. The \u0394F/F0 was calculated as \u0394F/F0\u00a0= (F\u2212F0)/F0 x 100%. To determine the running related responses of PNs, we assessed the neurons\u2019 activities simultaneously with animal\u2019s running gait patterns within single trials (Figures S8A\u2013S8I). Specifically, we examined whether and how the neuronal responses (quantified by average and maximum levels of Ca2+ activity) corresponded to specific running gait patterns. For each trial, we measured the average and peak activity of each neuron separately for each of four different running gait patterns before and after 20-minute FR training session. Animals\u2019 behavior during imaging sessions was assessed using video footage. Animals\u2019 forelimbs were videoed with a YI home camera (1080p full HD wireless infrared camera, 8Hz, model: YHS.2116.INT) and aligned with Ca2+ imaging frames. Offline analysis of animal\u2019s gait patterns from the videos was done manually frame by frame. Additionally, we determined the running related responses of the neurons by comparing their activities before and after turning the treadmill (pre-movement, stationary versus movement conditions). Ca2+ response profiles of individual neuronal somas to running were characterized by averaging the fluorescence traces (\u0394F/F0) across at least four running trials per condition (pre-training and post-training) aligned to turning the treadmill on (start of running). The baseline activity of each soma was calculated by averaging the activity during the ITI (15\u00a0s times at least 4 trials, denoted baseline activity), and was subtracted from the average response profile of each neuron. We determined if the average response profiles of individual neurons were significantly modulated to running by identifying time segments in the average response profiles following treadmill on time point that deviated from the baseline activity (above or below) by at least three times the standard deviation (SD) of the baseline activity. A neuron was considered to have a significant response to running if the duration of the deviant segment was at least 3 frames (6 s). Average neuronal response profiles aligned to treadmill on (start of running) were maximum-normalized by subtracting the maximum value of the average response profile and dividing by the difference between the maximum and minimum values. Neurons were then ordered according to the time of their maximum response to create the population sequence. In order to determine that the population temporal sequence was not simply due to ordering the normalized response profiles, we compared the population activity data to a shuffled version of the data (Figures S2L\u2013S2P) similar to previous studies (). The shuffled population activity data were created by rotating the response profiles (\u0394F/F0 traces before averaging) of individual trials for each imaged soma by a random amount relative to the time when the treadmill was turned on. We then averaged the shuffled response profiles of individual cells and maximum-normalized the shuffled data. We compared the temporal profile of the original and shuffled sequences (the cumulative sum of the time of the peak activity of the neurons) and the distributions of ridge to background ratio of the original and shuffled data (Figures S2O and S2P). Ridge to background was calculated as the ratio between the average \u0394F/F0 response profile in the peak value\u00a0\u00b1 3 surrounding time bins to the average \u0394F/F0 of all other time points. We shuffled and compared the data 500 times. Calculating the ridge to background ratios using\u00a0\u00b1 2 and\u00a0\u00b1 10 time bins yielded similar results (i.e., shuffled data were significantly different from original data, bootstrap, p\u00a0< 0.0001). We examined whether the neurons reached their peak activity relative to running onset at the same order during different learning phases, i.e., the stability of the ranking of the neurons in the population sequence (Figure\u00a01P). To that end we calculated the correlation coefficient between the rank of the neurons according to the maximum normalized activity in one running session and the rank of the same neurons in another session (following 20\u00a0min running training period). To determine if the correlation was significant, indicating the stability in the order in which cells reached their maximum activity, we compared the correlation coefficient calculated on the original data to that calculated on the shuffled data. In the shuffled dataset, we kept the original rank of the first session but randomly ranked the neurons in the second session. Significance was determined if the correlation calculated on the original unshuffled data was higher than >95% of the correlation calculated on the shuffled data. The selectivity of SST INs\u2019 response profiles to the running tasks was determined by the percentage of SST INs that had significantly different response profiles to FR and BR (Figure\u00a02). For each SST IN we calculated the absolute average difference between its average response profiles to FR and BR, named \u201cdifference measure.\u201d We then pooled the response profiles of all individual trials (of both FR and BR) and randomly assigned the response profiles as originating from either a FR or a BR trial. We then averaged over the randomly assigned trials to create the new shuffled average response profiles and calculated the shuffled difference measure. Assuming no difference between the average response profiles to FR and BR (null hypothesis), randomly assigning the individual response profiles to FR or BR should yield similar average response profiles and difference measure as the actual data. Finally, we repeated the process 500 times for each SST IN and determined significance if the difference measure for the unshuffled data was higher than >95% of the shuffled difference measure. The polarity of SST INs\u2019 response profiles to the running tasks was determined by the percentage of SST INs with significantly different responses to FR and BR that had an opposite direction of response to the two running tasks (determined according to the above description). For the measurement of spine Ca2+ transients in Figure\u00a06, we detected dendritic spine Ca2+ transients in response to running and\u00a0removed contributions to the signal due to back-propagating action potentials based on the dendritic shaft Ca2+ activity (Figures 6A\u20136C) (). Specifically, we extracted the fluorescence for each spine of its parent dendritic shaft and calculated the \u0394F/F0 denoted \u0394F/F0_dendrite. We then estimated the coefficients of the robust linear regression of \u0394F/F0 calculated for the spine versus \u0394F/F0_dendrite. We multiplied \u0394F/F0_dendrite by the slope of the fitted regression line and subtracted this scaled version of \u0394F/F0_dendrite from \u0394F/F0 calculated for the spine to obtain a back-propagation independent spine Ca2+ signal. We found that before the subtraction of back-propagation signals, 48% of spines displayed Ca2+ activity that was correlated with dendritic Ca2+ activity, whereas after back-propagation subtraction only 10% of the spines showed significant correlation. In the analysis presented in Figure\u00a06, we excluded spines whose Ca2+ activity were still significantly correlated with dendritic Ca2+ activity after back-propagation subtraction. We detected spine transients by identifying time segments following treadmill on time point that deviated from the baseline activity by at least three times the standard deviation (SD) of the baseline activity (as described above for soma activity). To compare spine activity between imaging sessions (e.g., before and after 20-minute FR training), we averaged the peak value of all transients in each spine per training session. The selectivity of pyramidal dendritic Ca2+ transients to the running tasks (Figure\u00a0S6K) was determined by subtracting the number of Ca2+ transients per minute on individual dendrite in response to BR from that to FR and divided by their sum. Data are presented as average\u00a0\u00b1 s.e.m unless otherwise noted. Sample sizes were chosen to ensure adequate power with the statistical tests while minimizing the number of animals used in compliance with ethical guidelines. We tested the data for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test and performed a-parametric or parametric statistical tests if normality was or was not rejected respectively. We used Wilcoxon rank sum test (or t test) to compare two groups and Kruskal-Wallis (or one-way ANOVA) to compare more than two groups. Kruskal-Wallis (or One-way ANOVA) tests were followed by Tukey-Kramer test for multiple comparisons. We used Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare the cumulative sum of the peak activity times and corrected with Bonferroni correction when more than one comparison was made. All tests were conducted as two-sided tests. Significance level was determined at 5%. All statistical details of the experiments can be found in the figure legends and in Table S1.

We propose that the communication subspace may be a general, population-level mechanism by which activity can be selectively routed across brain areas. Interactions among brain areas are widely assumed to be essential to most brain functions, yet we are only beginning to understand how neurons in distinct brain areas mediate these interactions. Previous studies of inter-areal interactions have related the spiking activity of pairs of neurons in different areas (, , , , , ), the spiking activity of a neuronal population in one area and a single neuron in another (, ), the spiking activity of a neuron or group of neurons in one area and the local field potential (LFP) in another (, , , , ), the LFPs recorded in different areas (, , , , ), or the trial-averaged population activity in distinct areas (). These approaches have provided insight into how interaction strength changes with stimulus drive (, , ), attentional state (, , , ), or task demands (, , , , , ). These previous approaches fall short, however, of elucidating how the spiking activity of neuronal populations\u2014the signals thought to encode information in the brain\u2014is related across areas on a trial-by-trial basis (). Pairwise correlations, by definition, ignore structure not evident in the interactions between two individual neurons. LFPs lump the activity of spiking populations into a single summary signal and thereby risk losing much of the richness of area-to-area interactions (, ). Trial-averaging allows one to study how mean signals (e.g., receptive field structure) are related, but not to understand how the moment-by-moment changes in activity in one area relate to those in another area (, ). Here we leverage trial-to-trial co-fluctuations of V1 and V2 neuronal population responses, recorded simultaneously in macaque monkeys, to understand the nature of population-level interaction between cortical areas. Within individual brain areas, trial-to-trial fluctuations in activity have yielded important insight into the effects of attention (, ), learning (, ), stimulus drive (, ), and more. These fluctuations involve multiple dimensions of activity shared among neurons (, , , , , , , , ), as identified using dimensionality reduction (). Each of these dimensions represents a characteristic way in which the activities of the recorded neurons covary (referred to as a population activity pattern). It is currently unknown whether all or only a subset of these dimensions are related across brain areas, and which dimensions are involved. In anesthetized macaque monkeys, we find that interactions between V1 and V2 are similar in strength to those between subpopulations within V1, but that the structure of those interactions is strikingly distinct. V2 activity is related to a small subset of V1 population activity patterns, which are distinct from the largest shared fluctuations among V1 neurons. The selective routing of specific population activity patterns between V1 and V2 can be described by a low-dimensional communication subspace, which defines which activity patterns are effectively relayed between areas. We found that the same low-dimensional structure was present in paired V1-V4 recordings in awake animals, suggesting a general principle of inter-areal interactions. We propose that the communication subspace can be a population-level mechanism by which activity is selectively and flexibly routed between distinct neuronal populations. We simultaneously recorded the activity of neuronal populations in the output layers (2/3-4B) of V1 (88 to 159 neurons; mean: 112.8) and their primary downstream target, the middle layers of V2 (24 to 37 neurons; mean: 29.4) (), in three sufentanil-anesthetized monkeys (Figure\u00a01A). Neurons consisted of both well-isolated single units and small multi-unit clusters. The recorded V1 and V2 populations had retinotopically aligned receptive fields, maximizing the probability of direct feedforward interactions (). We measured neuronal activity as spike counts in 100\u00a0ms bins during the presentation of drifting sinusoidal gratings of different orientations. To study how neuronal activity in the two areas is related, we analyzed trial-to-trial response fluctuations to repeated presentations of each grating. These fluctuations involve spiking activity that could propagate between areas, and thus provides a useful window for understanding inter-areal interactions (, , , , ). Specifically, we subtracted the appropriate peri-stimulus time histogram from each single-trial response and then analyzed the residuals for each stimulus orientation (henceforth referred to as a dataset) separately. To determine how V1-V2 interactions differ from interactions within V1, we divided the recorded V1 neurons into source and target populations (Figure\u00a01B). For each dataset, we matched the target V1 population to the neuron count and firing rate distribution of the measured V2 population (see STAR Methods). We then related the activity of the same source V1 population separately to the activity of the target V1 population (V1-V1 interaction) and that of the V2 population (V1-V2 interaction). We first characterized V1-V2 interactions by measuring the degree to which response fluctuations were shared between pairs of neurons (i.e., noise correlations), as in previous inter-areal studies (, ). The vast majority of V1-V2 pairs had correlations between 0 and 0.2 (Figure\u00a02A, red histogram; average correlation: 0.07\u00a0\u00b1 0.06 SD). V1-V1 correlations were remarkably similar to those of V1-V2 pairs (Figure\u00a02A, blue histogram; average correlation: 0.07\u00a0\u00b1 0.06 SD; two-sided Monte Carlo permutation test, p\u00a0< 0.01 for difference between V1-V1 and V1-V2). These weak correlations indicate that only a small fraction of a neuron\u2019s response variability can be explained by another individual neuron. Indeed, individual source V1 neurons could predict only 1.11%\u00a0\u00b1 0.03% and 1.35%\u00a0\u00b1 0.03% of the variability of\u00a0the target V1 and V2 neurons, respectively (Figure\u00a02B, solid lines). We next asked how well the variability of the target V1 and V2 neurons could be explained by the source V1 population using multivariate linear regression (see STAR Methods). On average, the source V1 population predicted 15.2%\u00a0\u00b1 0.7% of the V2 variability (Figure\u00a02B, red histogram), a substantial improvement over the performance afforded by individual V1 neurons. V1-V1 prediction quality was similar to that of the V1-V2 prediction (Figure\u00a02B, blue histogram; 12.9%\u00a0\u00b1 0.8%; two-sided Monte Carlo paired permutation test, p\u00a0< 0.01 for difference between V1-V1 and V1-V2). To assess whether the performance of the regression models is reasonable in absolute terms, we implemented a basic model of population interactions using a linear feedforward network. Regression performance for these simulated data was similar to performance on the physiological data either when the target population had Poisson variability or when the observed source population was a subset of the full input population (Figure\u00a0S1). In summary, both pairwise analysis and population-based regression models indicate that interactions between areas are similar in strength to those within a cortical area: fluctuations in the source V1 population can be used as effectively for predicting V2 activity as for predicting the fluctuations of other V1 neurons. We next asked whether the structure of these interactions is similar as well. Consider predicting the activity of a V2 neuron from a population of three V1 neurons using linear regression, as in the preceding section:where V2k is the predicted activity of a V2 neuron on the kth trial, ,  and  are the corresponding activities of the three V1 neurons on the same trial, and w1, w2, and w3 are the regression weights. We can plot the activity of the V1 population on each trial as a point in a three-dimensional space, where each axis represents the activity of one of the V1 neurons (Figure\u00a03A). The weights can be represented as a regression dimension, which captures which aspects of the V1 population activity are predictive of the V2 neuron\u2019s activity. Specifically, the location of the V1 activity along the regression dimension is the predicted activity of the V2 neuron (Figure\u00a03A, shading).  In a basic multivariate regression model, each V2 neuron has its own regression dimension. These regression dimensions could, in principle, fully span the V1 activity space (Figure\u00a03B). If this were the case, any fluctuation in V1 population activity would be predictive of the fluctuations of one or more V2 neurons (i.e., changing the V1 population activity would change the location of the activity along at least one of the regression dimensions). Alternatively, if the regression dimensions span only a subspace of the V1 activity space (shown as a plane in Figure\u00a03C), certain V1 fluctuations (i.e., those orthogonal to the plane, Figure\u00a03C, dashed line) would not be predictive of V2 fluctuations. We define predictive dimensions to be those which reside within the V1 subspace that is predictive of V2 fluctuations, and private dimensions as those which do not. The existence of private dimensions within the source population would allow for specific population activity fluctuations to be relayed downstream; any fluctuations along the private dimensions would be hidden from the target population. To test whether our ability to predict V2 fluctuations involves only a subspace of V1 population activity, we used reduced-rank regression (, ), a variant of linear regression in which the regression dimensions are constrained to lie in a low-dimensional subspace (see STAR Methods). If only a few dimensions of V1 activity are predictive of V2, then using a low-dimensional subspace should achieve the same prediction performance as the full regression model. For a representative dataset (Figure\u00a04A), only two dimensions were needed to achieve a prediction performance that was indistinguishable from the full regression model (triangle). In contrast, when we applied the same analysis to the target V1 population, six dimensions of the source V1 population activity were needed to reach the performance of the full model (Figure\u00a04B). Across all datasets, consistently fewer dimensions were needed to predict fluctuations in the V2 population (2.2\u00a0\u00b1 0.1) compared to the target V1 population (3.5\u00a0\u00b1 0.1; one-sided Monte Carlo paired permutation test, p\u00a0< 10\u22128; Figure\u00a04C). These results indicate that the V1 fluctuations that are predictive of V2 are confined to a small number of V1 dimensions. Notably, the number of dimensions needed to account for interactions between areas was smaller than the number of dimensions involved in interactions within an area. A possible explanation for the lower-dimensional interaction between V1-V2 compared to within V1 is that the V2 population activity is itself less complex, or lower dimensional, than the target V1 activity. For example, if the measured V2 population consisted of neurons with identical responses, then predicting those responses would involve the same weighting of V1 activity (i.e., one predictive dimension). More generally, the number of predictive dimensions will depend in part on the dimensionality of the target population activity. All else being equal, the lower the dimensionality of the target population activity, the smaller the number of predictive dimensions will be. We used factor analysis to test whether the V2 population activity was lower dimensional than the target V1 population activity. Factor analysis identifies factors (or dimensions) which capture shared activity fluctuations among neurons (, , , , , , , ). This analysis revealed that the dimensionality of the V2 activity was higher than that of the target V1 activity (Figure\u00a05A; 5.0\u00a0\u00b1 0.2 for V2; 3.7\u00a0\u00b1 0.1 for target V1; mean\u00a0\u00b1 SEM; one-sided Monte Carlo paired permutation test, p\u00a0< 10\u22128). Thus, the smaller number of V2 predictive dimensions cannot be explained by the V2 population responses being less complex than the target V1 population responses. To assess how the complexity of the target population influenced the dimensionality of the interactions, we compared the number of predictive dimensions to the dimensionality of the target population activity. For V1-V1 interactions, the number of predictive dimensions closely matched the dimensionality of the target population activity in each dataset (Figure\u00a05B, blue points). Although these two estimates of dimensionality are based on different analyses, their similarity suggests that the number of V1 predictive dimensions is as large as possible, given the complexity of the target population responses. In contrast, for V1-V2 interactions, the number of predictive dimensions was consistently lower than the dimensionality of the target population (Figure\u00a05B, red points). The finding that the V1-V2 interaction is lower dimensional than the V2 population activity could arise because the reduced rank-regression model predicted the activity of only a few V2 neurons, ignoring the others. To assess this possibility, we refit the model after removing the three V2 neurons whose activity was best captured by the regression model, a number which corresponded to the largest number of V2 predictive dimensions we observed. Refitting the model after removing these neurons had little effect on the number of estimated predictive dimensions (2.20\u00a0\u00b1 0.11 in the original analysis versus 2.20\u00a0\u00b1 0.09 after removing top three V2 neurons; two-sided Monte Carlo paired permutation test, p > 0.05), indicating that the small number of predictive dimensions reflects a population-level effect. We conclude that the difference in the number of V1 and V2 predictive dimensions cannot be explained by the complexity of the respective target population responses, but rather reflects the nature of the interaction between these areas. Whereas the V1-V1 interaction uses as many predictive dimensions as possible, the V1-V2 interaction is more selective and is confined to a small subspace of source V1 population activity, which we term a communication subspace. Notably, this low-dimensional interaction structure was also present in simultaneous population recordings in V1 and V4 of awake monkeys (Figure\u00a0S2), suggesting that the communication subspace is a general property of population-level interactions between brain areas. We next sought to understand the structure of the V1-V2 communication subspace. Specifically, we asked two related questions. First, we examined how the V1 and V2 predictive dimensions are related. Are the predictive dimensions for these target populations aligned or do they capture distinct activity fluctuations within the source V1 population? Second, we examined how the V1-V2 communication subspace relates to the structure of activity within the source V1 population. Is V2 activity predicted by the most dominant fluctuations within V1? To characterize the relationship between V1 and V2 predictive dimensions, we made use of the fact that these dimensions are both defined within the source V1 activity space and capture the parts of the source population activity that are most relevant for predicting each target population. We therefore removed the source V1 activity along the different predictive dimensions (see STAR Methods) and assessed whether the remaining source activity could still be used to predict activity in the target V1 and V2 populations. We first confirmed that our method for removing activity along predictive dimensions was effective. As expected, our ability to predict V2 fluctuations quickly decreased as we removed the source V1 activity along the dimensions that were most predictive of V2 (Figure\u00a06A, filled circles). Across datasets, average predictive performance vanished when all source activity aligned with the V1-V2 communication subspace had been removed (Figure\u00a06B, filled bars; average normalized performance: \u22120.005\u00a0\u00b1 0.001; value is negative due to cross-validation). In contrast, after removing the source V1 activity that fell along the top V1 predictive dimensions, we were still able to predict V2 fluctuations (Figure\u00a06A, open circles). Across datasets, we retained a substantial fraction of our ability to predict fluctuations in V2 after removing the same number of V1 predictive dimensions as the number of predictive dimensions in the V1-V2 communication subspace (Figure\u00a06B, open bars; average normalized performance: 0.24\u00a0\u00b1 0.01; one-sided Monte Carlo paired permutation test, p\u00a0< 10\u22128). This indicates that the V2 predictive dimensions are not well aligned with the leading V1 predictive dimensions. We obtained similar results when predicting fluctuations in the target V1 population (Figure\u00a06C). Across datasets, predictive performance was significantly higher after removing source activity along V2 predictive dimensions (Figure\u00a06D, open bars; 0.31\u00a0\u00b1 0.01) than after removing activity along the same number of V1 predictive dimensions (Figure\u00a06D, filled bars; 0.06\u00a0\u00b1 0.01; one-sided Monte Carlo paired permutation test, p\u00a0< 10\u22128). Even after removing all source activity that fell within the V1-V2 communication subspace, we could still predict fluctuations in the target V1 population. Together, these analyses indicate that the V1-V2 and V1-V1 interactions not only differ in the number of predictive dimensions, but also involve different patterns of source population activity. To understand how the V1-V2 communication subspace is related to the structure of the source V1 population activity, we used factor analysis to identify the dimensions of largest shared fluctuations within the source V1 population (termed dominant dimensions). We then predicted the activity of V2 neurons using linear regression based on the dominant dimensions only. This analysis is conceptually related to reduced-rank regression, which was used to identify the predictive dimensions. However, rather than identifying the subspace that is best for predicting fluctuations in the target population (as in reduced-rank regression), this analysis identifies a subspace that captures the largest shared fluctuations within the source population and then performs regression in that space. If the dominant source V1 dimensions are able to predict V2 activity as well as the V2 predictive dimensions, for the same number of dimensions, this would indicate that the V1-V2 communication subspace preferentially involves the largest activity fluctuations of the V1 population. However, as shown for a representative dataset, the dominant V1 dimensions (Figure\u00a07A, open circles) were not able to predict V2 as well as the predictive dimensions (Figure\u00a07A, filled circles). In contrast, within V1, the predictive and dominant dimensions performed similarly (Figure\u00a07B). Across datasets, predicting V2 fluctuations almost always required more dominant V1 dimensions than V2 predictive dimensions (Figure\u00a07C, red). However, for target V1 fluctuations, dominant dimensions of the source V1 population were nearly as informative as the predictive dimensions (Figure\u00a07C, blue; one-sided Monte Carlo permutation test for difference in the minimum number of dominant dimensions when predicting target V1 and V2, p\u00a0< 10\u22128 for 1 predictive dimension; p\u00a0< 10\u22128 for 2 predictive dimensions; p\u00a0< 0.01 for 3 predictive dimensions). These results indicate that the V1 predictive dimensions are aligned with the largest source V1 fluctuations. The V2 predictive dimensions, however, are distinct: not only are they less numerous, they are not well aligned with the V1 predictive dimensions nor with the largest source V1 fluctuations. Nearly all previous studies of interactions between brain areas have used pairwise spike-spike, spike-LFP, or LFP-LFP analyses. Here we investigated the structure of interactions between areas at the level of neuronal population spiking responses. We found a striking difference in the nature of V1-V1 and V1-V2 interactions, summarized in Figure\u00a07D. V2 activity was related to a small subset of population activity patterns in the source V1 population, and these patterns were distinct from the most dominant shared V1 fluctuations. In contrast, more activity patterns in the source V1 population were relevant for predicting the activity of other V1 neurons, and the dominant fluctuations in the source population were the most predictive. Interactions between areas are thus defined by a communication subspace: V1 activity that lies within the communication subspace is communicated with V2, whereas V1 activity that lies outside this subspace is not. Our analyses were designed to ensure a fair comparison of V1-V1 and V1-V2 interactions. First, we used the same V1 population to predict target V1 and V2 responses, ruling out any potential differences in the source population. Second, we matched the sizes of the target V1 and V2 populations as well as their firing rate distributions, ruling out differences in these basic target population properties. Third, we were able to predict fluctuations in the target V1 and V2 populations equally well (Figure\u00a02), so our results cannot be attributed to differences in the strength of V1-V1 and V1-V2 interactions. Finally, the spatial receptive fields of both the target V1 and V2 population overlapped those of the source population, and subtle variations in alignment could not explain the differences between V1-V1 and V1-V2 interactions (Figure\u00a0S3). It is important to note that the estimated number of predictive and dominant dimensions likely depends on the number of recorded neurons and trials (). Accordingly, our results do not define the dimensionality of V1-V2 interactions in absolute terms; rather, they indicate that those interactions are low dimensional relative to V1-V1 interactions. We found that if we analyzed only a portion of the recorded populations or trials, the difference between V1-V1 and V1-V2 interactions was less prominent (Figures S2D\u2013S2F). Thus, with larger datasets, the difference between these interactions is likely even larger than that we identified. Dimensionality reduction analyses have provided important insights into neuronal population activity structure and its function (see , for a review). However, such analyses have been applied almost uniquely to population responses recorded in a single brain area, rather than to the study of interactions between areas, as we have done. Two important recent studies have investigated the relationship between activity in motor cortex and muscles (, ). They found that preparatory motor activity avoids the potent (i.e., predictive) dimensions which relate cortical activity to muscles during movement, akin to our finding of private dimensions for V1-V2 interactions. Our work builds upon the strength of those studies by relating trial-to-trial fluctuations in directly connected neuronal populations (i.e., those with functional alignment and in specific cortical laminae; ). In addition, we studied the difference in interactions within and between areas, as well as the relationship between predictive and dominant dimensions in the source population. V2 likely performs non-linear operations on inputs received from V1 (, ). Our approach to understanding V1-V2 interactions was to study local fluctuations around different set points (i.e., the trial-to-trial variability around the mean responses to a particular grating)\u2014which function effectively as local linear perturbations in the non-linear transformation between V1 and V2. Our use of trial-to-trial fluctuations is consistent with most previous studies of inter-areal interactions (, , , , ), although these have used entirely distinct analyses such as spike-field coherence. To ensure that our estimates of V1-V2 interactions were not distorted by simple downstream non-linearities, we implemented several feedforward network models with standard non-linearities (e.g., squaring). In all cases, we found that our analyses recovered interaction dimensionality that closely matched the dimensionality of the linear weights (Figure\u00a0S4). Given this reasoning, how can we be sure that the communication subspaces are not an oddity, perhaps defining private and communicated V1 fluctuations differently for each grating stimulus? First, we confirmed that a communication subspace was evident when we analyzed our grating datasets together (Figure\u00a0S5). Thus, it is not the case that all V1 population fluctuations that are private during the presentation of one grating stimulus are relayed to V2 during the presentation of another. Consistent with the existence of a shared communication subspace, we also found that the communication subspace defined for responses to one grating could effectively predict responses to other gratings (Figure\u00a0S6). Second, we analyzed V1-V2 interactions during repeated presentations of brief naturalistic movies. These responses also revealed a communication subspace (Figure\u00a0S7), indicating that the low-dimensional V1-V2 interactions do not arise from the use of grating stimuli. Finally, we analyzed the relationship between the communication subspace and the mapping of stimulus-driven activity from V1 to V2 (i.e., the PSTHs) and found that the communication subspace was able to capture responses that included stimulus information (Figure\u00a0S8). Thus, the communication subspace identified using trial-to-trial fluctuations captures important aspects of the inter-areal circuity that is used to relay stimulus information. These lines of evidence together indicate that the communication subspace is a fundamental aspect of V1-V2 interactions. What is the basis of the communication subspace? One possibility might be that our results reflect global population fluctuations, which involve all neurons increasing and decreasing their activity together (, , ) and may be more prevalent under anesthesia (; but see ). However, since global fluctuations are one dimensional, they cannot by themselves explain the V1-V2 interactions reported here, which typically involved more than a single dimension. In addition, the most predictive dimensions for the V1-V2 interaction were not well aligned with the largest shared fluctuations in V1, nor with the dimensions that were most predictive of the target V1 activity. Notably, we observed a similar communication subspace in simultaneous population recordings in V1 and V4 of awake monkeys (Figure\u00a0S2), ruling out any confounding influence of anesthesia. Another possibility might be that the communication subspace between V1 and V2 reflects feedback from higher cortical areas (e.g., feedback from V4 or MT to V2 and V1). In highly interconnected networks, such as the visual cortex, it is difficult to infer with certainty the source of inputs, especially with correlational methods such as those employed here. However, two pieces of evidence suggest that feedback cannot explain our findings. (1) Feedback connections have coarse retinotopic specificity, with individual axons spanning a relatively large portion of the visual field (, ). Our effects, however, are retinotopically specific. That is, when we analyzed additional recording sessions where the V1 and V2 populations had receptive fields that were misaligned by several degrees, we found a much weaker V1-V2 interaction that was often well captured by a single predictive dimension (Figure\u00a0S3). Furthermore, this dimension was well aligned with the largest shared fluctuations of the source V1 population. The mismatch between the retinotopic specificity of our results and that of feedback connections suggests that the communication subspace does not arise primarily from feedback. (2) Our V2 recordings were performed in the middle layers, which do not receive feedback and are driven almost exclusively by the superficial layers of V1 (). Consistent with this, we found in these data an elevated probability of V2 spiking several milliseconds after the occurrence of a spike in V1 (). This functional signature also suggests a strong feedforward component to the V1-V2 interaction, though it does not exclude the possibility that feedback signals contribute as well. An alternative possibility might be that the low-dimensional communication subspace arises because only a small subset of V1 neurons project to V2. There is good evidence for selective connections between V1 and V2 () and between V1 and other areas (, but see  for a contrary view). However, additional simulations confirmed that our observations do not arise trivially from sparse anatomical projection between source and target areas (Figure\u00a0S9). Further, we emphasize that while anatomy constrains how activity can be routed in cortex, the flexibility of cognition and perception requires additional mechanisms that allow inter-areal signaling to be adjusted from moment to moment, based on task demands (e.g., , ). We propose instead that the communication subspace is an advantageous design principle of inter-area communication. The ability of a source area to communicate only certain activity patterns while keeping others \u201cprivate\u201d could be a means for the selective routing of signals between areas. To understand the computational benefit of structuring inter-areal communication in this way, we implemented a simulation that captures the common scenario of a source area projecting to two downstream areas, areas A and B (Figure\u00a08). If each downstream area reads from the source area using a different communication subspace, there will be dimensions of the source population activity that are relayed to area A but not to area B (Figure\u00a08A) and vice versa (Figure\u00a08B). Crucially, if the interaction between these areas does not involve communication subspaces, then all fluctuations in the source population will be relayed to both downstream areas (Figure\u00a08C). The communication subspace is consequently a population-level mechanism whereby activity can be selectively routed between brain areas. The selective routing allowed by the communication subspace could be adjusted dynamically, allowing moment-to-moment modulation of interactions between cortical areas. Dynamic routing could be accomplished by altering the structure of population activity in a source area; it need not involve changing the communication subspace itself. Much recent work has shown that the structure of population activity is highly and rapidly malleable, by stimulus drive (, , ), task demands (, , ), attention (, ), learning (, ), and other factors (). Allowing interactions between areas to be modulated by the alignment of population activity with a relevant communication subspace has several advantages over a well-known alternative: defining interaction strength by the phase-alignment of spikes to ongoing oscillations () (termed \u201ccommunication through coherence,\u201d CTC). First, the communication subspace hypothesis does not require coordinated oscillations between the source and target areas, which can be difficult to achieve in practice (). Instead, the implementation of a communication subspace requires only that the target area takes a particular type of weighted combination of its inputs, namely a linear readout that is low dimensional. This can be implemented in a linear feedforward network (, ), if the weights for each downstream neuron are defined as linear combinations of the same set of basis \u201cweights\u201d (or predictive dimensions). Second, different target areas (or subpopulations within the same target area) can have different communication subspaces in the same source area (Figure\u00a08). CTC can also route distinct signals to downstream targets by using different oscillations within the source area, each of which is coherent with a different downstream target. However, the number of oscillations that can be distinguished by phase is limited by the temporal precision of neurons, and it is not clear whether the same source neurons can entrain to different oscillations at the same time (). Our framework for understanding inter-areal population interactions makes clear predictions of how the communication subspace could contribute to behavior, which can be tested in future work. For instance, if attention involves altered inter-areal communication, this could be achieved by better alignment between population responses in a source area and the communication subspace relaying those responses to a relevant downstream area. Similarly, learning could involve achieving population activity patterns that are better aligned with an existing communication subspace (), or perhaps altering the communication subspace itself. Finally, the degree to which the effects of perturbation experiments (e.g., patterned optogenetic stimulation) would propagate across areas could depend on their alignment with the relevant communication subspaces. A critical implication of our work is thus that studying how experimental manipulations alter population responses in a given cortical area can be misleading. One must also understand how these altered population responses align with the mapping to downstream areas.

Animal procedures and recording details have been described in previous work (, ). Briefly, animals (macaca fascicularis, male, 2-3 years old) were anesthetized with ketamine (10\u00a0mg/kg) and maintained on isoflurane (1%\u20132%) during surgery. Recordings were performed under sufentanil (typically 6-18\u00a0\u03bcg/kg/hr) anesthesia. Vecuronium bromide (150\u00a0\u03bcg/kg/hr) was used to prevent eye movements. All procedures were approved by the IACUC of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The data analyzed here represent a subset of those reported in , namely those that involved the largest and best retinotopically-aligned populations. V1 activity was recorded using a 96 channel Utah array (400 micron inter-electrode spacing, 1\u00a0mm length, inserted to a nominal depth of 600 microns; Blackrock, UT). We recorded V2 activity using a set of electrodes/tetrodes (interelectrode spacing 300 microns) whose depth could be controlled independently (Thomas Recording, Germany). These electrodes were lowered through V1, the underlying white matter, and then into V2. Within V2, we targeted neurons in the input layers. We verified the recordings were performed in the input layers using measurements of the depth in V2 cortex, histological confirmation (in a subset of recordings), and correlation measurements. For complete details see  and\u00a0. Voltage snippets that exceeded a user-defined threshold were digitized and sorted offline. The sampled neurons had spatial receptive fields within  of the fovea, in the lower visual field. Average receptive field size (defined as  2 S.D.s of a Gaussian function fit to the data) was  for V1 and  for V2. We measured responses evoked by drifting sinusoidal gratings (1 cyc/; drift rate of  Hz;  in diameter; full contrast, defined as Michelson contrast (Lmax-Lmin/Lmax+Lmin) where Lmin is 0  and Lmax is 80 ) at 8 different orientations (22.5\u00b0 steps), on a calibrated CRT monitor placed 110\u00a0cm from the animal (1024\u00a0\u00d7 768 pixel resolution at 100\u00a0Hz refresh). Each stimulus was presented 300-400 times for 1.28 s. Each presentation was preceded by an interstimulus interval of 1.5 s. The duration of each experiment varied from 5 to 7\u00a0days. We recorded neuronal activity in three animals. In two of the animals, we recorded in two different but nearby locations in V2, providing distinct middle-layer populations. We refer to each of these five recordings as a session. We treated responses to each of the 8 stimuli in each session separately, yielding a total of 40 datasets. We counted spikes in 100\u00a0ms bins, beginning 160\u00a0ms after stimulus onset and spanning a total of 1\u00a0s (10 bins per trial). To study how neuronal activity in the two areas is related, we reasoned that any fluctuations in the V1 responses, whether due to changes in the visual stimulus or not, could relate to fluctuations in V2. We therefore subtracted the appropriate peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) from each single-trial response, and then analyzed the residuals for each orientation (termed datasets) separately. We confirmed that the temporal structure had little effect on our results by shuffling the data across trials while maintaining the temporal identity; doing so reduced the predictive performance for the V2 population to 0. We found qualitatively similar results for a wide range of bin widths (20 ms - 1 s). Furthermore, we obtained similar results after z-scoring both the source and target population responses, ruling out the possibility that our results were driven by a few high-firing neurons. For all analyses, we excluded neurons that fired less than 0.5\u00a0spikes/s on average, across all trials. We compared our analyses of V1-V2 interactions to the results of applying the same analyses to a held-out V1 population (V1-V1). The target population in the V1-V1 analyses was a held-out subset of the originally recorded population, which was matched in neuron count to the corresponding V2 population. We also matched the firing rate distribution (mean-matched) to the V2 population separately for each stimulus condition (as in ). To do so, we binned the firing rate distribution of the V1 and V2 populations (for each neuron, the average firing rate was taken across time and trials for each dataset), and determined the common firing rate distribution (i.e., for each firing rate interval, we took the minimum neuron count between the two populations). For each firing rate interval, we then randomly picked this minimum number of neurons from the corresponding bin in each population, without replacement. Because we had many more V1 than V2 neurons, the common distribution usually matched the V2 distribution and we selected an equal number of V1 neurons. The size of the matched populations ranged from 15 to 31 units across datasets (mean: 22.3). The V1 neurons that were not selected for the held-out population defined the source V1 population. V2 neurons that were not selected for the V2 mean-matched population were not used in the analysis. We repeated the mean-matching procedure 25\u00a0times, using different random, mean-matched subsets of neurons (and consequently producing a different source population). Results for each dataset are based on averages across these repeats. The pairwise correlation (rsc) analysis in Figure\u00a02A was based on a single mean-matching procedure which was done jointly for all stimulus conditions. Statistical evaluation for this analysis was performed after converting rsc to z-scores using the Fisher transformation ():  We first related trial-to-trial fluctuations in the source V1 population to those in the target populations using a linear model of the form:where X is a  matrix containing the residual activity of the source V1 population and Y is a  matrix containing the residual activity of the target (V1 or V2) population (n represents the number of data points, p and q are the number of neurons in the source and target populations, respectively). The coefficient matrix B is of size . Each of the q columns of B linearly combines the activity of the p neurons in X to predict the activity of one neuron in Y. B can be found using the ordinary least-squares (OLS) solution which minimizes the squared prediction error:   To reduce overfitting, we used ridge regression (referred to as full regression model in the main text), a variant of classical linear regression, which gives the solution , where I is a  identity matrix and \u03bb is a constant that determines the strength of regularization. We chose the value of \u03bb using 10-fold cross-validation. Specifically, we selected the largest \u03bb for which mean performance (across folds) was within one SEM of the best performance, separately for each dataset (i.e., for each stimulus condition in each recording session). To quantify model performance, we employed 10-fold nested cross-validation () We sought to test whether the target population activity (V1 or V2) could be predicted using a subspace of the source V1 population activity. In other words, we asked if the linear model  was still accurate when we impose B to be of a given rank, . This constrained linear regression problem is known as reduced-rank regression (RRR) (, ), and can be solved using the singular value decomposition:where  is the ordinary least-squares solution and the columns of the  matrix V contain the top m principal components of the optimal linear predictor . To predict target population activity using RRR, we computed:where  is a matrix of size . The columns of  define which dimensions of the source population activity are used when generating predictions: they are the predictive dimensions. The sets of weights used to predict each target neuron (the columns of ) are themselves linear combinations of the columns of . Note also that the columns of  do not form an orthonormal basis. Rather, they are uncorrelated with respect to the source activity, i.e., , where  is the covariance matrix of the source population activity and D is a diagonal matrix. Thus, the columns of  are linearly independent and .   To find the optimal dimensionality for the RRR model (the value of m), we used 10-fold cross-validation and found the smallest number of dimensions for which predictive performance was within one SEM of the peak performance. To quantify the dimensionality of the activity in the target populations we used Factor Analysis (FA) (, ). FA is defined by:where  is a q-dimensional vector containing the observed residuals at a given time point, L is the  loading matrix that defines the relationship between the m-dimensional () latent variable  and , \u03bc is a q-dimensional vector and  is a  diagonal matrix. We estimated the dimensionality of the latent variable  in two steps: (1) we found the number of dimensions  that maximized the cross-validated log-likelihood of the observed residuals; (2) we fitted a FA model with  dimensions and chose m, using the eigenvalue decomposition, as the smallest dimensionality that captured 95% of the variance in the shared covariance matrix . This procedure provides more robust estimates of the FA model dimensionality ().  In order to remove the source population activity along the predictive dimensions, we projected the source activity onto the subspace that is uncorrelated with the predictive dimensions. Formally, we state that two dimensions defined by the vectors  and  are uncorrelated with respect to the source activity matrix X if:where  is the covariance matrix of the source activity. Let matrix  contain the predictive dimensions. The set of vectors in the uncorrelated subspace is:   In particular, it will be useful to find an orthonormal basis for this subspace:  This can be accomplished using the singular value decomposition (SVD). Start by defining  and consider its SVD . Choosing Q as the last  columns of V (corresponding to the 0 singular values) yields , , which makes Q an orthonormal basis for the uncorrelated subspace. We then projected the source population onto the uncorrelated subspace, , and predicted target activity using ridge regression between  and Y. We also tested the effect of removing all population activity that was predictive of the target population activity under any stimulus condition by analyzing responses to all stimulus conditions together (Figure\u00a0S5). To identify the dominant dimensions in the source population, we fit a FA model, and determined the optimal dimensionality (as described above). Using this FA model, we estimated the latent variables  for each , then performed an orthonormalization procedure to order the elements of  by the amount of shared variance explained (). This allowed us to predict the target population activity using only the most dominant V1 dimension (first element of orthonormalized ), the top two most dominant V1 dimensions (first two elements of orthonormalized ), etc. We then compared the performance of the dominant and predictive dimensions for predicting activity of the target populations. In order to show how a communication subspace can subserve selective communication (Figure\u00a08), we simulated responses in a source population (3 neurons), as well as in two downstream populations (3 neurons each). The responses of each downstream neuron were generated as a linear combination of the activity of the neurons in the source population. In Figure\u00a08A-B, where both downstream areas interact with the source area via communication subspaces, the predictive dimensions for all neurons in each area were chosen to lie within a 2-dimensional subspace. Specifically, we generated these dimensions by creating randomly oriented unit vectors in the xy plane and then rotating these vectors 20\u00b0 around the x axis for the downstream area A neurons and 40\u00b0 for the downstream area B neurons. Predictive dimensions for both downstream areas were then rotated 20\u00b0 around the z axis. In Figure\u00a08C, all predictive dimensions were generated by creating randomly oriented unit vectors in the 3-dimensional source activity space. To generate source activity we drew a sample from a Gaussian process with a squared exponential kernel (length scale ). This sample was then embedded into the 3-dimensional source activity space by projecting the activity along a chosen dimension, i.e., if the Gaussian process sample is represented as a  vector  (where T represents the number of time points), and the chosen dimension is represented by the  vector , then the 3-dimensional source activity is given by . When a communication subspace was present, the source activity was chosen to lie along the private dimension of the relevant area. In Figure\u00a08C, any choice of  leads to qualitatively similar results, so we chose it to align with the dimension used in Figure\u00a08B. The response for each downstream neuron is given by the projection of the source activity onto the corresponding predictive dimension. Statistical details can be found in the Results and figure legends. All statistical tests reported in the main text treat the datasets as independent (with the exception of Figure\u00a02A, in which data are pooled across all stimuli, resulting in a single pairwise correlation value per pair per session). Repeating the same statistical tests across the five sessions (i.e., averaging the results across the 8 stimuli for each session) also returned significant results () for all tests, with the exception of Figure\u00a02B, where we can no longer reject the null hypothesis that the average predictive performance is the same when predicting target V1 and V2.

Most skilled human behaviors evolve in temporally structured sequences. A breakdown of their fluency (e.g., in stuttering, dyspraxia, and occupational dystonia) can profoundly impair everyday functioning (, , ). Historically, two opposing theories have been proposed for the neural basis of motor sequence control. The associative chaining account, originating from the pioneering work of Ebbinghaus in 1885 (), postulated strong forward connections between successive elements of a sequence, leading to the behaviorist idea that each sequence element serves as a conditioning stimulus for the subsequent element during the formation of complex behaviors (). In modern neuroscience, this hypothesis has engendered the formulation of state-space models of skilled motor control, such as writing and Morse code production (, , , ). These models are characterized by a spatio-temporal trajectory determined by the serial evolution of population activity, so that a population state n triggers the state n+1, the latter n+2, etc. In neocortex-inspired recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the evolution of multiunit activity is primarily determined by the connectivity matrix acquired through learning. In other words, motor sequences are controlled by a serial transition through neural population states, which are mapped onto motor actuators. However, since Lashley\u2019s seminal proposal (), there has been an alternative account, suggesting that all elements of a planned sequence are active simultaneously before execution, leading to the characteristic finding of transposition errors among nearby elements (); e.g., as observed in speech or typing. So-called \u201ccompetitive queuing\u201d (CQ) models can formally explain this behavior by introducing a parallel preparation layer that determines serial order by competitive interactions between sequence elements driven by differing levels of excitation according to the sequence (Figures 1A\u20131C; see  for a review). The most active node wins the competition, generates the corresponding action, and is then self-inhibited through the planning layer, allowing the next most strongly activated node to generate the next action. This process effectively allows a conversion of a parallel planning code into a serial output during execution. Crucially, the respective excitation gradients are learned by associations from a temporal context layer to each sequence element. The pattern of activity in this layer evolves over time during encoding, allowing different items to be associated with different states, and is reset prior to sequence production such that it evolves in the same way as during encoding. The form of activity in the temporal context layer can be as simple as a decaying start signal (), a combination of start and end signals (), or, to capture effects of temporal grouping or rhythm, a sequence of overlapping states (, ). Importantly, the temporal context layer represents sequential timing or position independently of the actions whose accurate sequential execution it controls. Thus, although the evolution of activity in the temporal context layer could well reflect associative chaining, temporal and characteristic effector order errors reflect both the precision of the mapping from the temporal context to the parallel planning layer and the process of selection during CQ. Thus, CQ models predict a strict factorization of sequential and item information, whereas RNN network models that are successfully trained to reproduce sequences do so by producing a mixed internal representation reflecting conjunctions of positions and items (). Direct neurophysiological evidence in support of the CQ model has been obtained by , who taught non-human primates to copy geometrical shapes presented on the computer screen while they recorded multi-unit activity from the prefrontal cortex, an area homologous to the inferior frontal cortex in the human brain (). Specifically, they characterized multi-unit patterns during the production of each segment in the shape-drawing sequence and then decoded the presence of each segment\u2019s activity pattern during movement preparation and production. They found that the strength of each segment\u2019s activity pattern at the end of the preparation phase corresponded to its respective position in the upcoming sequence (Figure\u00a01D), as predicted by CQ models. However, it is not clear whether these activity patterns primarily reflected a graded preparation of specific motor elements in the sequence or a higher-level temporal or ordinal position signal (first, second, third, etc.) that might transfer across different motor elements. Here we provide direct evidence for CQ in the human brain during the preparation of accurately timed finger sequences from memory using non-invasive whole-head recordings (magneto-encephalography [MEG]). Further, we demonstrate that the observed CQ pattern in the MEG signal during preparation primarily reflects the ordinal position of sequence items, largely independent of finger identity and fine temporal structure, and cannot be explained by a graded muscular pre-activation. Finally, we show that the fidelity of CQ correlates with behavioral accuracy across participants, suggesting that these neural representations are relevant for skilled sequence production and timing. Participants were trained for 2\u00a0days to associate four abstract visual cues with the production of four five-element finger sequences from memory following a \u201cgo\u201d cue (Figure\u00a02A). In the MEG session on the third day, the mean incidence of finger errors (trials with the wrong finger press order or incomplete sequences) across the whole group ranged from 0%\u201313% (mean, 2%; SD, 3%). Participants were median-split by the incidence of finger errors for later analysis, with more accurate participants producing, on average, 0.6% (SD, 0.3%) and the less accurate 3.7% (SD, 4%) trials with an incorrect finger order. Although, for the majority of participants, the production of the correct sequences was temporally aligned according to temporal interval orders T1 and T2 across finger orders F1 and F2, respectively (Figures 2A and 2B), there was also a substantial variation of timing accuracy across participants. The mean temporal error from target interval structure (expressed as percent of target interval) across the whole group ranged from 10%\u201333% deviation from the target interval sequence (mean, 19%; SD, 7%; Figure\u00a02B). Hence, participants were also grouped using a median split of interval deviation (temporal error) for later analysis, with more accurate participants showing, on average, 14% (SD, 3%) and the less accurate 25% (SD, 5%) absolute deviation from target intervals. On average, participants tended to produce finger press intervals 7% shorter than the respective target intervals, resulting in sequences that were slightly faster than the target sequence. Participants who were less accurate (larger absolute deviation from the target) were also more likely to produce shorter rather than longer intervals (r\u00a0= \u22120.817, p\u00a0< 0.001, two-tailed). Crucially, participants who made more finger errors also tended to be less accurate in their timing (r\u00a0= 0.616, p\u00a0<\u00a00.011, two-tailed), suggesting that the differences in accuracy are driven by overall skill level rather than a strategic trade-off between temporal and finger accuracy. To evaluate sequence-specific learning, we conducted a post-training test on the day before the MEG session during which participants were asked to synchronize their respective presses to a visual finger cue, as in the first stages of training (STAR Methods). Participants showed significantly more accurate synchronization to visual sequences when they encountered trained sequences as well as sequences with a trained finger order or trained timing compared to untrained control sequences (Figures 3A and 3B). This result confirmed an independent representation of the temporal structure of sequences that can be utilized across finger sequences, in line with previous studies (, , ). Participants with more pronounced sequence-specific learning (quantified as the difference in synchronization accuracy to trained versus untrained sequences) produced larger inter-press intervals during the MEG session (r\u00a0= 0.501, p\u00a0< 0.001, two-tailed), suggesting that the tendency to compress the sequence was a marker of poor skill learning. During the MEG scan, finger sequences were visually cued with an abstract shape for 1.8\u20132.2\u00a0s before a go cue. This provided participants with a short period to retrieve and prepare the corresponding sequence from memory prior to production. We used multivariate linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to characterize whole-head MEG activity patterns associated with the execution of each finger press. Specifically, we trained our classifier on the average MEG signal amplitude pattern across all sensors in a 10-ms window immediately preceding each finger press onset during sequence production and then applied the classifier to successive 10-ms time windows during sequence preparation to establish the posterior probability of each press-related pattern appearing during that period (Figure\u00a04; see Figure\u00a0S1 for complementary analyses using 5-, 20-, and 50-ms windows). We tested the main prediction of CQ models: that there is a stable and graded likelihood of decoding each item (i.e., finger press) during the preparation period, reflecting its position in the upcoming sequence. This stands in contrast to associative chaining or state-space models, which predict an increased likelihood of decoding the first item alone prior to sequence production. In addition, classification across different finger sequences (\u201ctemporal\u201d and \u201cpositional\u201d transfer; Figure\u00a04) allowed us to distinguish the contribution of representations of specific motor acts in the parallel preparation layer from those reflecting a higher-order temporal context signal, whereas classification across different temporal sequences (\u201cspatial\u201d and \u201cpositional\u201d transfer) allowed us to examine the extent to which the temporal context signal reflects positional or fine-temporal structure. Our analysis demonstrated that, during sequence preparation, the probability of each finger press being decoded across time windows reflected its serial position in the upcoming sequence (Figure\u00a05A, \u201cwithin\u201d), analogous to findings obtained using invasive electrophysiology recordings in macaques (). Specifically, the mean pattern probability during the final 1\u00a0s of the preparation period was modulated by press position (F(1.71, 25.60)\u00a0= 42.23, p\u00a0< 0.001, \u03b72\u00a0= 0.738; one-way repeated measures ANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser-corrected, \u03c72 (9)\u00a0= 37.56, p\u00a0< 0.001). As predicted by the CQ hypothesis, pattern probabilities during this period were significantly higher for first versus second (t(15)\u00a0= 4.62, p\u00a0< 0.001), second versus third (t(15)\u00a0= 4.57, p\u00a0< 0.001), and third versus fourth (t(15)\u00a0= 4.51, p\u00a0< 0.001) finger presses, whereas the probability of decoding the fourth press was not significantly higher than that of the fifth (t(15)\u00a0= 1.78, p\u00a0= 0.19; one-tailed t tests according to the CQ hypothesis, Bonferroni-corrected for four comparisons). Next we aimed to establish whether CQ of press patterns during the preparation period was primarily driven by representations of effector identity (i.e., index finger, middle finger), versus effector-independent sequence timing (i.e., 550-ms interval, 650-ms interval), or ordinal position (i.e., first item, second item), which are indistinguishable when training and testing the classifier on data from a single learned sequence. To do so, we first examined whether CQ of neural signals during sequence preparation was preserved when classifying MEG patterns across sequences with the same target timing but a different finger order (temporal transfer). If neural CQ reflected the upcoming order of specific effectors (here, fingers) alone, then we would expect the accurate queuing of pattern probabilities to collapse because the upcoming finger order is rearranged relative to the training order in the second to fifth positions; i.e., the training pattern for a particular press position would reflect a different finger than that in the test pattern. In contrast, if the neural CQ signals during preparation included representation of sequence timing or ordinal position regardless of effectors, then CQ during the preparation phase should be upheld across sequences with a different finger order (i.e., exhibit temporal transfer). This analysis revealed that CQ during the preparation period was qualitatively preserved across sequences with the same temporal intervals but differing finger order (Figure\u00a05A, temporal). Specifically, mean pattern probability in the final 1\u00a0s of the preparation period was still modulated by press position (F(1.68, 25.15)\u00a0= 26.97, p\u00a0< 0.001, \u03b72\u00a0= 0.643; one-way repeated measures ANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser-corrected, \u03c72 (9)\u00a0= 39.87, p\u00a0< 0.001), with pattern probabilities at the end of the preparation\u00a0period being significantly higher for first versus second (t(15)\u00a0= 4.06, p\u00a0= 0.002), second versus third (t(15)\u00a0= 3.29, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and third versus fourth (t(15)\u00a0= 3.97, p\u00a0= 0.002) finger presses, whereas the probability of decoding the fourth press\u00a0was again not significantly higher than that of the fifth (t(15)\u00a0= 0.98, p\u00a0= 0.68; one-tailed t tests according to the CQ hypothesis, Bonferroni-corrected for four comparisons). These results demonstrate that the CQ of sequence elements during preparation is only partially driven by finger identity but mainly derives from overlapping representations of sequential timing or ordinal position in a temporal context layer. They are also in line with significant advantages for learning sequences that retain the trained timing structure (Figure\u00a03). Next, we tested whether changing the fine timing structure between training and testing patterns while retaining the same ordinal finger sequence (spatial transfer) affected CQ. This analysis revealed that CQ during the preparation period was qualitatively preserved across sequences with the same finger order but differing temporal structure (Figure\u00a05A, spatial). Specifically, the mean pattern probability during the final 1\u00a0s of the\u00a0preparation period was still modulated by press position (F(1.61, 24.21)\u00a0= 32.10, p\u00a0< 0.001, \u03b72\u00a0= 0.687, one-way repeated measures ANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser-corrected, \u03c72 (9)\u00a0= 45.11, p\u00a0< 0.001), with pattern probabilities at the end of the preparation period being significantly higher for first versus second (t(15)\u00a0= 4.22, p\u00a0= 0.001), second versus third (t(15)\u00a0= 3.57, p\u00a0< 0.006), and third versus fourth (t(15)\u00a0= 4.22, p\u00a0= 0.001) finger presses, whereas the probability of decoding the fourth press was again not significantly higher than that of the fifth (t(15)\u00a0= 1.69, p\u00a0= 0.22; one-tailed t tests according to the CQ hypothesis, Bonferroni-corrected for four comparisons). These results are in line with significant advantages for learning sequences that retain the trained finger order structure (Figure\u00a03). In combination, these results showed that CQ of neural signals during the preparation period is preserved across finger orders and temporal structure, suggesting that it includes a high-level ordinal position code. To directly test this hypothesis, we investigated whether changing both the finger order and temporal structure between training and test patterns while retaining information about ordinal position in the sequence alone (positional transfer) would abolish CQ. Again, CQ during preparation was retained (F(1.62, 24.30)\u00a0= 32.10, p\u00a0< 0.001, \u03b72\u00a0= 0.657, one-way repeated measures ANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser-corrected, \u03c72 (9)\u00a0= 41.19, p\u00a0< 0.001), with mean pattern probabilities in the final 1\u00a0s of the preparation period being significantly higher\u00a0for first versus second (t(15)\u00a0= 4.05, p\u00a0= 0.002), second versus third (t(15)\u00a0= 3.56, p\u00a0< 0.006), and third versus fourth (t(15)\u00a0= 3.70, p\u00a0= 0.004) finger presses, whereas the probability of decoding the fourth press was again not significantly higher than that of the fifth (t(15)\u00a0= 1.58, p\u00a0= 0.270; one-tailed t tests according to the CQ hypothesis, Bonferroni-corrected for four comparisons). These results confirm the manifestation of a finger- and timing-independent code for ordinal position during\u00a0preparation that transfers across motor and temporal sequences. Having established the preservation of CQ when classifying across sequences, we next sought to directly quantify any reductions related to the change of finger- or timing-related information. To this end, we directly compared the relative strength of neural CQ signals, quantified as the distance between consecutive press probabilities across the last 1\u00a0s of the preparation period in each trial (single trial median averaged across trials for each participant) for each of the classifiers (\u201cwithin,\u201d \u201ctemporal,\u201d \u201cspatial,\u201d and \u201cpositional\u201d). A repeated measures ANOVA with factors of \u201cfinger order\u201d and \u201ctiming\u201d changes revealed significant main effects of \u201cfinger order\u201d (F(1.39, 15)\u00a0= 12.15, p\u00a0= 0.003, \u03b72\u00a0= 0.447) and \u201ctiming\u201d changes (F(1.67, 15)\u00a0= 12.15, p\u00a0= 0.002, \u03b72\u00a0= 0.468) as well as a significant interaction between the two factors (F(1.92, 15)\u00a0= 41.74, p\u00a0< 0.001, \u03b72\u00a0= 0.736). Direct comparisons between neural CQ during\u00a0preparation for \u201cwithin\u201d sequence versus \u201ctemporal,\u201d \u201cspatial,\u201d and \u201cpositional\u201d transfer analyses, respectively, all yielded significant decreases of the probability distance during preparation (p\u00a0< 0.0001, two-sample t test corrected for three\u00a0comparisons). These findings demonstrate a significant attenuation of CQ when training and testing across sequences. They suggest that only the conjunction of temporal, spatial, and positional codes constitute a full-blown neural pattern for sequence preparation, consistent with the behavioral costs of changing the finger order and timing of a trained sequence (Figure\u00a03). Finally, to probe the transfer costs further, we trained the classifier on MEG data prior to presses with specific finger identities (in different ordinal positions and preceded by different temporal intervals), temporal intervals (in different ordinal positions and effected using different fingers), or ordinal positions (using different fingers and preceded by different temporal intervals) across all sequences. We then tested these classifiers on each sequence separately and averaged the results according to the position of the finger press or preceding temporal interval in that sequence to examine differences in CQ during the preparation period. Consistent with the findings described above, CQ was most pronounced when training on\u00a0specific ordinal positions within each sequence, independently of finger identity or the preceding temporal interval (Figure\u00a0S2). In sum, these results indicate that the CQ during sequence preparation is primarily driven by a effector- and timing-independent code for ordinal position, presumably reflecting the overlapping successive representations in a temporal context layer. In addition to the preparation phase, we also examined the dynamics of finger press probabilities during the production phase. Phasic execution-related peaks were markedly attenuated in analyses that classified across finger sequences (\u201ctemporal\u201d and \u201cpositional\u201d classifiers; i.e., when finger identity differed between training and test sequences) compared with the \u201cwithin\u201d and \u201cspatial\u201d sequence analysis (where finger identity was preserved between training and test sequences). Specifically, the mean decoding likelihood at the time of each finger press across the second to fifth presses was significantly higher in the \u201cwithin\u201d sequence analysis (production values cross-validated across trials; Figure\u00a0S3) compared with \u201ctemporal\u201d (t(15)\u00a0= 4.71, p\u00a0< 0.001, paired one-tailed t test) and positional (t(15)\u00a0= 5.70, p\u00a0< 0.001,) but preserved in \u201cspatial\u201d transfer analyses (t(15)\u00a0= 0.82, p\u00a0= 0.638, paired one-tailed t test, Bonferroni-corrected for three comparisons), which classified across sequences with the same finger order. However, it is important to note that the respective press probabilities were still significantly above chance (i.e., 20%) at the time of each respective finger press across all analyses (all p\u00a0< 0.001, one-tailed t test against chance, Bonferroni-corrected for four comparisons). This suggests that, although finger identity had a stronger influence on\u00a0decoding probabilities during sequence production than preparation, the finger-independent, position-related patterns observed during the preparation period were also utilized during sequence production. Although the neural signature of CQ described above suggests a top-down signal for the temporal planning of finger sequences, it is still possible that this pattern is partly driven by a weighted activation of muscles at the periphery so that the muscle synergy activations related to each finger movement are weighted before production according to their occurrence. Hence, using the same LDA procedure as for the MEG data training and classification (Figure\u00a04), we examined data obtained from muscles of the right hand (flexor carpi radialis, abductor polices brevis, abductor digiti minimi, first dorsal interossei) concurrently with the MEG recording. This analysis revealed that, during preparation, only the pattern probability for the first finger press in the sequence, performed by the same finger across all four sequences, was elevated above those for the other sequence elements. Specifically, the mean electromyography (EMG) pattern probability during the final 1\u00a0s of the preparation period was modulated by press position for the \u201cwithin\u201d sequence analysis (i.e., training and testing the classifier on MEG data from the same pattern; F(4, 60)\u00a0= 7.44, p\u00a0< 0.001, \u03b72\u00a0= 0.332; one-way repeated measures ANOVA) as well as \u201ctemporal\u201d (F(2.74,41.17)\u00a0= 5.27, p\u00a0= 0.005, \u03b72\u00a0= 0.260; one-way repeated measures ANOVA), \u201cspatial\u201d (F(4, 60)\u00a0= 7.39, p\u00a0< 0.001, \u03b72\u00a0= 0.330; one-way repeated measures ANOVA), and \u201cpositional\u201d (F(4, 60)\u00a0= 5.88, p\u00a0< 0.001, \u03b72\u00a0= 0.282; one-way repeated measures ANOVA) transfer analyses. However, in contrast to the MEG data, this effect was driven purely by the elevation of the first press pattern probability in the sequence, which was the same across\u00a0all sequences within subjects (first versus second \u201cwithin\u201d: t(15)\u00a0= 3.882, p\u00a0= 0.003; \u201ctemporal\u201d: t(15)\u00a0= 3.583, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005; \u201cspatial\u201d: t(15)\u00a0= 4.106, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003; \u201cpositional\u201d: t(15)\u00a0= 3.886, p\u00a0= 0.003), with no other differences between adjacent press probabilities reaching significance in any analysis (p > 0.775, one-tailed t tests according to the CQ hypothesis, Bonferroni-corrected for four comparisons). Finally, the distance between consecutive press probabilities in the MEG data did not correlate with the distance in the EMG data in either the \u201cwithin\u201d (r\u00a0= 0.246, p\u00a0= 0.179), \u201ctemporal\u201d (r\u00a0=\u00a00.321, p\u00a0= 0.112), \u201cspatial\u201d (r\u00a0= 0.182, p\u00a0= 0.250), or \u201cpositional\u201d (r\u00a0= 0.128, p\u00a0= 0.319) classification analyses. Although the data provide strong evidence for muscular preparation of the first press before the go cue, we could find no evidence for weighted muscular synergies driving the CQ pattern in the CNS during sequence preparation. It is conceivable that the pattern probability gradient observed here during the preparation period arises simply from auto-correlation in the MEG time series and the temporal proximity of training and testing time windows rather than the CQ of sequence-related patterns. Specifically, this alternative hypothesis assumes that there is a slow-moving brain state across both preparation and production phases within each trial, resulting in the MEG signal being more similar during time windows that are close together (i.e., preparation period and first press) than those further apart (i.e., preparation period and fifth press). If true, then there would be a gradient of pattern probabilities during movement preparation, reflecting the relative temporal offset between the preparation period (on which the classifier was tested) and the time of each finger press (on which the classifier was trained). To examine this possibility, we conducted several control analyses. First, we examined decoded press probabilities around the time that the sequence cue appeared, indicating that sequence preparation should begin 1.8\u20132.2\u00a0s before the go cue. If these decoded press probabilities simply reflected temporal proximity to the corresponding press, then the appearance of this cue should not change the press probabilities. However, we found an abrupt increase in the differences between successive press probabilities at the onset of the visual sequence cue (Figures S4A and S4B), with CQ becoming more pronounced as full information regarding the order and timing of finger presses becomes available. Next, we examined the slope of each finger press probability time series during the preparation period. If they simply reflect temporal proximity to the upcoming press, then they should each exhibit a constant positive slope over the preparation period. Conversely, if the press probabilities reflect the stable CQ of elements in the upcoming sequence, then they would not be expected to change over the preparation period. Consistent with the latter hypothesis, none of the press probabilities for the second to fifth items in the upcoming sequence showed a significant positive slope during the final 1\u00a0s of the preparation period (all p\u00a0>\u00a00.99, one-sample tests against zero, Bonferroni-corrected for 5 comparisons; Figure\u00a0S4C), although the probability slope for the first finger did approach significance (p\u00a0= 0.07). Finally, we examined correlations between the MEG activity patterns on which each finger press classifier was trained and those during every other time bin across the preparation and production periods (Figure\u00a0S5A). If press probabilities during sequence preparation arose as a result of slow drift in the MEG signal, then correlations between the ongoing MEG activity and the training patterns should be positive and increase gradually with temporal proximity to the relevant finger press. Conversely, we found that activity patterns for the second to fifth finger presses were anti-correlated with MEG activity patterns during the preparation period, with correlation coefficients only becoming positive after the onset of sequence production (see Figure\u00a0S5B for the EMG pattern similarity analyses and Figure\u00a0S5C for MEG and EMG production pattern similarity matrices used to train the classifier). Overall, these findings are consistent with stable differences in press probabilities arising as a result of\u00a0CQ shortly after the sequence cue appears, rather than a slow increase in press probabilities arising as a result of increasing temporal proximity to the respective classifier training windows. Next, we asked whether the degree of neural CQ during sequence preparation was relevant for the subsequent production of the finger sequences retrieved from memory. Specifically, we examined whether the average distance between successive pattern probabilities during the final 1\u00a0s of the preparation period (immediately preceding the go cue) predicted the subsequent finger order and timing accuracy across trials in the MEG session (STAR Methods). Consistent with the predictions of CQ models, our findings suggest that participants with a larger mean distance between adjacent press probabilities according to their sequence positions tended to make fewer finger errors during the MEG session (r\u00a0= \u22120.508, p\u00a0= 0.022; median split by finger accuracy: t(15)\u00a0= 1.99, p\u00a0= 0.033) and produce smaller temporal errors relative to the target timing structure of sequences (r\u00a0= \u22120.600, p\u00a0= 0.007; median split by temporal accuracy: t(15)\u00a0= 3.87, p\u00a0< 0.001; Figures 6A and 6B). In particular, the probability dynamics shown in Figure\u00a06C illustrate striking differences in the fidelity of CQ during sequence preparation between participants with more and less accurate behavioral performance (median split by timing accuracy; see Figure\u00a0S6 for median split by finger order accuracy) as well as the relative preservation of phasic response curves during the serial execution period. Crucially, this correlation with behavioral accuracy was also unique to MEG patterns. Despite the elevation of the first EMG press pattern probability prior to the go cue, which could have played a role in subsequent sequence production, the fidelity of CQ in EMG patterns did not show any significant relationship with overall points gained or the size of temporal errors (Figures 6F\u20136H). In contrast to the correlation between temporal accuracy and average pattern probability distance across participants, we did not find evidence that pattern probability distance during preparation predicted temporal accuracy during subsequent production on a trial-by-trial basis. Within participants, the trial-by-trial correlation coefficients ranged from r\u00a0= \u22120.251 to r\u00a0= 0.157 (SD\u00a0= 0.107), with a predicted negative correlation being significant at p\u00a0< 0.05 in only 5 of 16 participants (Figure\u00a06D, grouped by timing accuracy). Accordingly, participants with a more pronounced neural CQ pattern during sequence preparation had better overall performance in the sequence production phase. However, despite the presence of CQ at the trial-by-trial level (Figure\u00a06E), this neural signal did not guarantee high execution accuracy on each trial, which may be influenced by other downstream processes for motor implementation. For the EMG patterns, in line with the group analysis, we did not find any consistent significant trial-by-trial correlations between the EMG pattern probability distance and temporal accuracy. Within participants, the trial-by-trial correlation coefficients ranged from r\u00a0= \u22120.208 to r\u00a0= 0.295 (SD\u00a0= 0.137), with a predicted negative correlation being significant at p\u00a0< 0.05 in only 3 of 16 participants (Figure\u00a06I, grouped by timing accuracy) with, on average, no CQ at the single-trial level (Figure\u00a06J). Therefore, in\u00a0the case of EMG data, there was no evidence of the median\u00a0probability distance associated with performance, neither across nor within participants (trial-by-trial). Finally, we sought to identify the neural origins of CQ during preparation in MEG sensor and source space. To this end, we used a searchlight analysis to determine where the CQ signal during the preparation period was strongest. Specifically, we quantified the average distance between consecutive press probabilities at a single time point 0.5\u00a0s before the go cue in each trial, after training and testing our classifiers on data from the same finger press sequences (\u201cwithin\u201d sequence analysis). These median distance values were then z-transformed across all sensor and voxel searchlights within each participant prior to group-level statistical analysis. The most pronounced effect of CQ during preparation appeared in the right temporal sensors (t(15)\u00a0= 3.58, p\u00a0< 0.01, uncorrected; Figure\u00a07A). In line with this finding, the same analysis conducted in source space showed a significant CQ distance effect to originate from a single cluster (pcluster\u00a0< 0.001) comprising the right temporal cortex, specifically the parahippocampus, extending ventrally into the fusiform area (Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] coordinates of peak\u00a0voxel: 30, \u221230, \u221224, t(15)\u00a0= 6.94, p\u00a0= 0.005, p value family-wise error [FWE]-corrected at voxel level) and the right (ipsilateral) cerebellum, specifically lobules VIII (MNI coordinates of peak voxel: 34, \u221230, \u221250, t(15)\u00a0= 6.51, p\u00a0= 0.009) and V (MNI coordinates of peak voxel: 64, \u221246, \u221230, t(15)\u00a0= 5.72, p\u00a0= 0.046; Figure\u00a07C). In addition, to localize the sources of the press-related training patterns (that is, the representations of execution of a specific finger press within a given sequence), we trained and tested our classifier on MEG data obtained 10\u00a0ms prior to each finger press within each motor sequence using a 5-fold cross-validation procedure. As before, decoding accuracy values were z-transformed across sensors and voxel searchlights within each participant prior to group-level statistical analysis. Consistent with prior findings (, ), the accuracy of finger press decoding was most pronounced in the sensors located above the left sensory and motor areas contralateral to the moving hand and the right temporal sensors (t(15)\u00a0= 3.11, p\u00a0< 0.01, uncorrected; Figure\u00a07B), the latter partly containing the same significant sensors as in the CQ analysis from the preparation period. At the source level, we found a large significant cluster (pcluster\u00a0< 0.001) comprising contralateral primary sensory and motor regions with peaks in the primary sensory cortex (MNI coordinates of peak voxels: \u221222, \u221238, 52, t(15)\u00a0= 11.19, p\u00a0< 0.001 and \u221254, \u221230, 40, t(15)\u00a0= 8.87, p\u00a0= 0.001), extending medially into the cingulate cortex (MNI coordinates of peak voxel: \u221214, \u221228, 44, t(15)\u00a0= 8.96, p\u00a0= 0.001; Figure\u00a07D). Finally, to gain a more detailed picture of the complementary contributions of these regions during sequence preparation and production (Figures 7A\u20137D, line and boxplots), we examined CQ during the preparation phase and finger press decoding accuracy from the production phase in each group of significant sensors and peak voxels of significant clusters reported above. Interestingly, the finger press decoding accuracy in the right temporal sensors (t(15)\u00a0= 8.66, p\u00a0< 0.001) as well as the right parahippocampal (t(15)\u00a0= 10.73, p\u00a0< 0.001) and cerebellar sources (t(15)\u00a0= 10.73; p\u00a0< 0.001, one-sided t tests against chance level) identified by the CQ analysis during the preparation phase showed above-chance finger press decoding accuracy in all sixteen subjects during the production phase. This suggests that activity patterns in parahippocampal and cerebellar regions during preparation also contained information about the finger press being executed during sequence production, although the size of the effect was eclipsed by the concurrent representation of finger press identity in contralateral S1 and M1 regions. In contrast, the probabilities in central sensors as well as contralateral S1 and M1 did not show any evidence of a CQ gradient during preparation (sensor level: one-way repeated measures ANOVA, F(2.32, 17.77)\u00a0= 0.37, p\u00a0= 0.72, \u03b72\u00a0= 0.024; Greenhouse-Geisser-corrected, \u03c72 (9)\u00a0= 21.58, p\u00a0= 0.01; source level: F(3, 32.18)\u00a0= 1.82, p\u00a0= 0.16, \u03b72\u00a0= 0.108; Greenhouse-Geisser-corrected, \u03c72 (9)\u00a0= 18.71, p\u00a0= 0.03), suggesting that central and contralateral neocortical sensorimotor areas did not contribute to establishing the temporal order of finger presses before execution. In sum, our results indicate a special role of parahippocampal and effector-related cerebellar sources in establishing a CQ gradient during sequence preparation and its utilization during sequence execution, whereas contralateral primary sensorimotor sources appear to contribute to the task during sequence execution only. Using non-invasive neurophysiological recordings (MEG) in combination with multivariate pattern classification (LDA), we provide direct evidence for parallel CQ of planned sequential actions in humans. Our study extends previous findings in animal () and computational models (, , , , ) in several directions. We show that neural CQ signals reflect an abstract template for ordinal position that is transferable across movement sequences and that the strength of CQ during preparation predicts the participant\u2019s skill level during production. In addition, we localize the neural CQ signal during preparation to ipsilateral (right) parahippocampal and cerebellar regions and the production signal to the contralateral sensorimotor neocortex. These findings imply that sequential learning is factorized into representations of ordinal structure and specific movements, which are combined within a CQ mechanism. Despite differences in methods and species, our results bear remarkable resemblance to electrophysiology data obtained from macaques (). Specifically, our data suggest that the elements constituting a movement sequence are prepared in parallel, with the corresponding pattern probabilities being weighted by their respective position in the subsequent sequence. After the go cue, these pattern probabilities transitioned into phasic increases reflecting the serial execution of the finger presses. Our data are at odds with an alternative model of motor sequence control that has dominated the field in the last decade, implying that skilled sequences such as handwriting or tapping sequences (e.g., Morse code production) are controlled by serial state-space trajectories in RNNs mapped onto motor actuators downstream (, ). According to these models, we would not expect to find the respective population states for each movement to be reinstated before sequence initiation. An exception is the superpositional coding of sequence elements at the onset of sequence recall produced using an RNN model by . Their model was able to produce population activity patterns relating to each position in the sequence and exhibit a summation of these patterns at the onset of the sequence without an explicit CQ architecture. This renders the RNN encoding effectively \u201cparallel\u201d and, thus, compatible with both the probability gradient for sequence elements during preparation shown by  and our findings (Figure\u00a05A). It is possible that both serial chaining and parallel queuing of sequence representations co-exist in the nervous system. Accordingly, their utilization may be determined by the kinematic features of the motor sequence. Specifically, in contrast to the current discrete motor sequence (involving temporal gaps in between movements), continuous and overlapping sequences are prone to be encoded as integrated synergies, with movement timing emerging from state-dependent control; e.g., position- or velocity-dependent information (, , , ). Notably, most skilled actions in everyday life, such as speech, handwriting, and tool use, involve a wide range of discrete and continuous movements, necessitating the combination of these two control modes. Here future studies need to establish how different sequence types employed in these everyday domains are segmented and prepared at the neural level. Finally, these theoretical accounts can be integrated in principle. Multiunit recordings during the preparation and production of reaching movements in non-human primates have revealed that changes in neural state related to planning occur in the null sub-space; i.e., a neural state that is distinct from the state during production, consistent with RNN predictions (). Accordingly,  proposed that such null-subspaces for each movement may be utilized to cue each element in the sequence independently. This suggestion, in principle, allows for a parallel control of discrete action sequences within the RNN framework. We assessed whether the CQ pattern during preparation was driven by the preparation of specific movements in the sequence or by an action-independent template for the upcoming sequence, as predicted by models of serial recall within the framework of CQ (, , , ). By classifying within and across sequences with different finger orders and timing (Figure\u00a04), we showed that the CQ signal during preparation was largely preserved under these circumstances, whereas the phasic increases in finger press probability during sequence production were distorted after the effectors diverged (second to fifth presses). This indicates that the training patterns, corresponding to mean activity in a 10-ms period before each registered finger press, contained information on the ordinal position in the sequence in addition to the effector information and that this information was retrieved from memory in the sequence planning stage. The retrieval of an abstract template for ordinal position during movement planning is in line with models suggesting that the temporal evolution of the sequence is established by input from a reproducible temporal context signal to a parallel planning layer (, , , ). Furthermore, independent behavioral transfer of trained sequence timing to new finger orders in current (Figure\u00a03) and previous studies in humans (typing, vocal sequences) and animal models (birdsong) (, , , , ) supports the notion that temporal sequence features were encoded separately from the specific movements. This cannot be easily reconciled with classical associative chaining models or the idea of a single integrated spatio-temporal neural trajectory where the serial position is inextricably linked to the item (here, finger), such as in RNN models in which timing is an emergent property of the population trajectory. However, RNN models are, in principle, well-suited to serve as neural clocks () and have been shown to acquire superpositional coding of the list elements activated at the onset of recall (). Thus, the reported CQ of sequence element probabilities before movement production could primarily reflect a gradient of superimposed patterns encoding each temporal position in the sequence. Effectively, this mechanism implies the reinstatement of a high-level sequential plan during sequence preparation that can be utilized across different movement sequences in a modular manner. We found that the most pronounced pattern of CQ during preparation originated in the right parahippocampal area. Neuroimaging studies have shown the recruitment of hippocampal and parahippocampal regions during motor sequence learning tasks, specifically those involving sequences of discretely timed movements, including those learned implicitly (, , ). Moreover, parahippocampal activity has been reported to correlate specifically with the accuracy of temporal tapping patterns involving a sequence of short and long intervals (). Our results substantiate the broader involvement of hippocampal and parahippocampal areas in the timing of sequences (, ), and more specifically in the temporal succession or ordinal structure of sequences (, ). The temporal context signal itself could reflect the output of hippocampal \u201ctime cells\u201d (). The observed graded press probabilities according to ordinal position in the sequence suggest that the first several press representations are all simultaneously active, with different levels of activity, as driven by connections from the overlapping representations in the temporal context layer corresponding to specific ordinal positions (Figures 1A\u20131C). Importantly, these can be shared across different sets of movement sequences (that is, across mappings to the items in the parallel planning layer established through Hebbian learning), enabling a higher-level sequential template (, ). Further, source reconstruction indicated the involvement of ipsilateral cerebellar lobules V and VIII, which have been shown to hold sensory and motor representations of fingers of the ipsilateral hand in humans (). This suggests that the cerebellum works in concert with parahippocampal areas to achieve the queuing of actions during sequence preparation. Specifically, we speculate that, while the parahippocampal areas may retrieve a more abstract sequential plan for the sequence (), the representation of the actions themselves may be set by effector-specific cerebellar circuits in the form of a fine-grained spatio-temporal forward model of the finger sequence before onset of the production phase (, ). Notably, activity attributed to the parahippocampal area and the cerebellum showed above-chance accuracy in decoding the sequence presses during the production period, whereas the reverse, neocortical sensorimotor regions showing CQ of finger press patterns during preparation, did not hold true. This dissociation suggests that the structure of the upcoming sequence is pre-specified outside of the neocortical regions that generate the\u00a0movements and continues to be utilized during production (corresponding to temporal context and parallel planning layers in Figure\u00a01A), whereas the regions representing the movement synergies are involved during production only (items in the competitive choice layer in Figure\u00a01A). Despite the presence of a high-level template for ordinal position across sequences, we found the strength of the queuing pattern during preparation to be diminished significantly when classifying across sequences with a different finger order or timing or both. These results suggest that representations that integrate ordinal position with specific movements and precise timing are also present, even at the stage of preparation. Taken together, our data suggest that the brain learns the task structure and factorizes behavior into specific actions, their temporal structure, and ordinal position. Associating actions with a sequential position and selecting among them by CQ may be sufficient to generate skilled sequence production. This factorization makes learning more efficient and allows for transfer of a learned structure to new motor sequences. Participants who achieved a higher skill level in the sequence production from memory showed a larger separation between adjacent press-related pattern probabilities during sequence preparation; i.e., the CQ pattern was more prominent in participants who made fewer finger and smaller timing errors (Figures 6A\u20136C). This is in line with the architecture of CQ models, in which more pronounced differences in the parallel planning layer (Figure\u00a01) reduce the chance of pressing a finger at the wrong time during sequence production. Remarkably, the significant correlation between overall performance and mean CQ strength contrasted sharply with the absence of a trial-by-trial correlation within participants. This dissociation is a possible indication that the strength of CQ during sequence preparation is a neural strategy adopted by, on average, more skilled performers. Although this neural strategy may be beneficial, it does not guarantee accurate performance on each trial, due to downstream modulations occurring between planning and motor implementation. Nonetheless, CQ was present on a trial-by-trial basis, which excludes the possibility that CQ is an artifact of averaging across trials with single elevated press probabilities. Specifically, participants who had reached a better behavioral performance tended to have more trials showing clear CQ than less skilled participants (Figure\u00a06D). The current non-invasive measure of CQ during sequence planning in humans as well as the link between overall CQ strength and performance provides a promising step toward the identification of markers for skilled sequence preparation. Determining the amount of separation between sequence elements before movement production may be useful in the context of neurofeedback training to improve performance in patients with higher-order motor impairments affecting sequence initiation and fluency, e.g., stuttering, dyspraxia, and occupational dystonia. Finally, our approach has the potential to advance the development of brain-machine interfaces for paralyzed patients. Previous studies have looked at predicting single targeted movements () or sequences up to two movements at a time; e.g., from invasive recordings (). The current non-invasive method may assist the readout of a multi-element sequence during the planning period with the aim of achieving more fluent control of external devices for skilled sequence production, such as a virtual keyboard or tool use via an intelligent prosthesis. Further information and requests for resources should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Dr. Katja Kornysheva (e.kornysheva@bangor.ac.uk). Sixteen right-handed healthy adults (9 females; mean age 24.4 years, SD: 4.9) with normal or corrected-to-normal vision participated in this experiment which included two days of training and one MEG session. Five additional participants participated in the study but had to be excluded as follows: two participants due to poor performance at the end of the training session or during the MEG session (error rate > 40%), one participant due to the absence of sequence-specific learning at the end of training, one participant due to technical issues with the MEG system and one due to discomfort during the MEG session leading to the termination of the experiment. All participants gave written informed consent to participate. The study was approved by the University College London Research Ethics Committee for Human-Based Research (UCL Ethics ID: 1338/006, Data Protection: Z6364106/2011/10/25). All participants were financially compensated for their participation. Stimuli were presented via a digital LCD projector (brightness\u00a0= 1500 lumens, resolution\u00a0= 1024\u00a0\u00d7 768 pixels, refresh rate\u00a0= 60\u00a0Hz) onto a screen (height\u00a0= 32\u00a0cm, width\u00a0= 42\u00a0cm, distance from participant\u00a0= 70\u00a0cm) that was parallel to the participant\u2019s face inside a magnetically shielded room using the Cogent (http://www.vislab.ucl.ac.uk/cogent.php) toolbox running in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA). Participants had a similar setup during behavioral training involving the same response device (5 buttons, Current Designs), with the visual stimuli shown on the computer screen directly and the participants being seated at an office desk. Stimuli were symmetrical abstract visual fractals. For each participant the four sequence cues were randomly selected and assigned to the sequences from a pool of sixteen fractals. Each trained sequence consisted of five-finger presses (finger order) and five target intervals (550, 650, 800, 983, 1300ms) between finger presses (timing or temporal interval order), respectively. Sequence construction followed a factorial design, with two orders of temporal intervals (T1 and T2) and two finger order sequences (F1 and F2) resulting in four unique temporally structured finger sequences (Figure\u00a02A), generated randomly for each participant. Importantly, however, the finger identity and target timing for the first press in each sequence was preserved across all four sequences learned by each participant. Participants were presented with a feedback screen after each trial showing the number of cumulative points across the whole experiment, as well as feedback on whether they pressed the correct finger at the correct time. Participants received two points per trial for a correct finger sequence with a temporal deviation from target timing of less than 30%, one point for a correct finger sequence with a temporal deviation of less than 60% and zero points in any other case. During the first two training days participants were presented with an auditory sound concurrently with the feedback screen, which indicated 0-2 points. No auditory feedback was presented during the MEG session on day 3. Training on day 1 consisted of 7 instructed blocks containing only trials in which the sequence was cued by a circle appearing on the target finger at the target timing after the \u2018Go\u2019 cue to which the participants had to synchronize (168 trials), 7 mixed blocks (56\u00a0instructed and 112 from memory trials following each other in a blocked 1:2 pattern, respectively) and 7 blocks with sequences produced from memory (168 trials). Training on day 2 consisted of 7 mixed blocks as previously and 12 blocks (288 trials) produced entirely from memory. Additional testing that included trained and untrained sequences (consisting of untrained finger and interval orders) presented as instructed trials was also conducted before and after training blocks on day 1 and 2, respectively. These included trained and untrained sequences presented as instructed trials. The MEG session consisted of 2 mixed blocks (16 instructed and 32 from memory trials) for participants to refresh their memory of the sequences and become accustomed to the MEG environment. This was followed by 10 blocks with concurrent MEG and EMG recordings containing trials with sequences produced entirely from memory (giving a total of 240 trials split evenly between the four trained sequences). MEG was recorded continuously at 1200 samples/second using a whole-head 275-channel axial gradiometer system (CTF Omega, VSM MedTech) while participants sat upright in a magnetically shielded room. Head position coils were attached to nasion, left, and right auricular sites to provide anatomical co-registration. Participants were also fitted with four EMG electrodes to measure finger movement-related muscular activity. The electrodes were placed above the flexor carpi radialis (FCR), abductor polices brevis (APB), abductor digiti minimi (ADM), first dorsal interossei (FDI). FCR was recorded with a belly-belly montage, APB, ADM and FDI with a tendon-belly montage. To determine temporal accuracy in trials produced entirely from memory, we calculated a mean absolute deviation from target interval structure for each trial expressed as percentage of the target intervals. For the pre and post-test which consisted of instructed trials only, we calculated the absolute reaction time deviation from the finger cues to which the participant had to synchronize. MEG data analysis made use of SPM8 (, Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, United Kingdom), Fieldtrip () Donders Institute for Brain Cognition and Behavior) and custom MATLAB code. MEG data were downsampled to 1000\u00a0Hz, epoched for pre-processing into long trials spanning \u22122.8 to\u00a0+12\u00a0s around the fractal cue to include a baseline fixation, fractal cue, \u2018Go\u2019 cue, sequence production and feedback. A 48-52Hz stopband filter was then applied to remove the 50\u00a0Hz power line noise within these long epochs. Channel artifacts were inspected in each participant, but no channels were identified as corrupted in any of the datasets. Due to the need to retain as many trials as possible for pattern classification and the involvement of long epochs, physiological artifacts related to heart rate, eyeblink, and breathing were identified based on the characteristic topography and time-course for each participant using ICA (RUNICA algorithm) and removed from the dataset. This procedure was carried out blind to the sequence conditions using the Fieldtrip component data browser, which allows the inspection of the topography and trial-by-trial time-course of the components. ICA-corrected data were then submitted to multivariate classification analysis, with the test probabilities calculated for a shorter epoch encompassing the preparation and production phases only (\u22122 to 4.5\u00a0s after the \u2018Go\u2019 cue). The EMG data were downsampled, epoched, and filtered in the same way as the MEG data. No trials were removed from the dataset, so that the EMG data from the same trials as in the MEG dataset was submitted to multivariate classification analysis. First we trained a standard LDA classifier to distinguish the MEG activity at the onset of each of the five button presses in a sequence. Following preprocessing, mean signal amplitude on each sensor during the 10ms period immediately before the onset of each response button press in the sequence was determined for all correct trials (mean proportion of correct trials across participants: 97.3% (SD: 3.1%); range: 87.2%\u201399.7%;). These mean signal amplitude values were used as a training dataset for all correct trials of each of the four sequences, respectively. The mean sensor pattern for each button press, and the common sensor-by-sensor co-variance matrix was determined from the training dataset. A Gaussian-linear multi-class classifier (cf. Supplementary Material) was then used to calculate the posterior probability of an activity pattern belonging to each of the five presses in the sequence across non-overlapping 10ms time windows in each trial of a) the same sequence (\u2018within\u2019), b) a sequence with the same target timing, but a different finger order (\u2018temporal\u2019), c) a sequence with the same finger order, but a different target timing (\u2018spatial\u2019) and d) a sequence with both a different finger order and timing than the training sequence (\u2018positional\u2019). The same procedure was used for the analysis of EMG patterns. For statistical analysis of CQ during sequence preparation, an average probability for each of the five press patterns was determined for per trial in a 1\u00a0s time window immediately before the \u2018Go\u2019 cue. We then quantified the CQ strength in each trial by taking the median difference in posterior probabilities for each pair of consecutive finger presses in each trial (i.e., from 1st to 2nd, 2nd to 3rd, 3rd to 4th and 4th to 5th), and then the mean distance across trials. Since the 1st press had a special status with the finger identity and target onset timing remaining the same across sequences for each participant, we also calculate this distance measure without the 1st press probability (median difference from 2nd to 3rd, 3rd to 4th and 4th to 5th). To display pattern probability dynamics, probabilities for each finger press pattern were averaged across trials for each 10ms time window (cf. Figure\u00a0S1 for 5ms, 20ms and 50ms windows analyses), and then averaged across sequences. For display purposes only, the data were smoothed using a sliding average boxcar of 100\u00a0ms (i.e., ten 10\u00a0ms time bins) using the MATLAB fastsmooth function (https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/19998-fast-smoothing-function). The \u2018within\u2019 sequence analysis trained and tested the classifier on time windows (training on production, testing on preparation data) from the same set of trials. Accordingly, the classification of production-related time-windows \u2013 i.e., 10ms before the 1st-5th press, respectively \u2013 was performed on the training data, running the risk of over-fitting (although it is important to note that the specific timing of finger presses, and therefore the specific time bin from each trial used to train the classifier, varied from trial to trial). Nonetheless, to support the validity of press probability dynamics during the production period, we performed a 10-fold cross-validation \u2018within\u2019 sequence analysis, in which the classifier was successively trained on 90% of trials and then tested on the remaining 10% until all trials had formed part of the test dataset, with press probability dynamics averaged over all ten folds. Importantly, these press probability curves showed qualitatively the same phasic increases and decreases as in the original \u2018within\u2019 sequence analysis (Figure\u00a0S3). The linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer spatial filter algorithm from the Dynamic Analysis in Source Space (DAiSS) toolbox for SPM12 was used to estimate cortical activity on a 10mm grid for whole brain analyses based on preprocessed MEG data. Co-registration to MNI coordinates was based on nasion, left and right pre-auricular fiducial points, and the forward model was derived from a single shell fit to the inner skull surface of a canonical T1 image. There data were then submitted to searchlight analysis. To identify the neural origin of the CQ signal during sequence preparation at the sensor and the source levels we used a searchlight approach in combination with LDA. The searchlight size corresponded to \u223c1% of the data, i.e., three sensors at the sensor level and 20 voxels at the source level. For the focal LDA analysis at the sensor level, we first determined the two nearest neighbors of each sensor based on the MEG sensor layout. As in the case of the whole-head analysis, the LDA classifier was then trained on mean signal amplitude from those three sensors during the 10ms period immediately before the onset of each physical button in correct trials. Next, we tested the classifier on mean signal amplitude from the same three sensors in a single 10ms time window 500ms before the \u2018Go\u2019 cue and quantified the probability of each finger press being decoded in each trial. Finally, as in the previous CQ distance analysis, we computed the median distance between the probability of the 1st to 5th (\u2018within\u2019) finger presses, respectively, averaged across trials for each sequence and then across sequences for each participant. We then z-transformed the median distance values across sensors for each participant and computed a one-sample t-statistic on z-score values at each sensor across participants. There data were then plotted as t-statistic at the scalp level and significant sensors at p\u00a0< 0.01 marked with a point and a label. The same analysis was applied to mean signal amplitude in source space using searchlights of 20 voxels as features in the LDA. Whole brain results were subjected to a random effects analysis with an uncorrected threshold of t(15) > 3.73, p\u00a0< 0.00. Peak voxels and t-values of significant clusters were then reported, and the data plotted as t-statistics with a threshold of t(15) > 5.24, p\u00a0< 0.05 (FWE corrected at the voxel level) centered on the peak voxel (). Peak voxels and t-values of significant clusters were then reported in the results and the data plotted as a t-statistic at the scalp level at a threshold of t(15) > 5.24, p\u00a0< 0.05 (FWE corrected at the voxel level) centered at the peak voxel (MNI coordinates: 30, \u221230, \u221224). The data thresholded at t(15) > 3.73, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 (uncorrected) can be found in Figure\u00a0S7A. Finally, to identify regions that were driving the differences between finger presses during the sequence production period, we employed a searchlight approach in combination with LDA using data from the production period only. As in the analysis described above, the searchlight size corresponded to \u223c1% of the data \u2013 three sensors at the sensor level and 20 voxels at the source level. Here the LDA classifier was trained to distinguish between the activity patterns of sensors or voxels during the 10ms period immediately before the onset of each physical button in correct trials. We used a five-fold cross-validation procedure (iteratively training on 80% of trials and testing on the remaining 20%) and quantified the probability of each finger press being correctly identified within trials for each finger press sequence. The data were than averaged across sequences and z-scored across sensors or voxels within each participant. Sensor accuracy results were then plotted as t-statistic at the scalp level and significant sensors at p\u00a0< 0.01 marked with a point and a label. At the source level, whole brain results were corrected using a random effects analysis with an uncorrected threshold of t(15) > 3.73, p\u00a0< 0.001. Peak voxels and t-values of significant clusters were then reported in the results and the data plotted as t-statistics at the scalp level with\u00a0a threshold of t(15) > 5.93, p\u00a0< 0.05 (FWE corrected at the voxel level) centered on the peak voxel (MNI coordinates: \u221222, \u221238, 52) (). The data thresholded at t(15) > 3.73, p\u00a0< 0.001 (uncorrected) can be found in Figure\u00a0S7B.

Optogenetic manipulations of VIP+ INs and computational modeling further showed that VIP+ disinhibition is necessary for goal-directed learning and related reorganization of hippocampal pyramidal cell population dynamics. Our results demonstrate that disinhibitory circuits in the hippocampus play an active role in supporting spatial learning. The neocortex contains a diversity of GABAergic interneurons (INs) that play key roles in cortical computation. Classes of cortical GABAergic INs exhibit diverse morphological, molecular, and physiological characteristics and directly inhibit principal neurons at specific subcellular compartments such as the axon initial segment, soma, and different dendritic regions (, ). However, a distinct subset of INs also selectively targets other INs, resulting in disinhibition of principal cells (, ). This cortical disinhibition has been implicated in sensorimotor integration, attention, memory-guided behavior, gain control, and circuit plasticity (, , , , , , ). A major subpopulation of disinhibitory INs express the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) (, , ) and has long been recognized as a potential disinhibitory circuit motif in the hippocampus (, , , , , , ), a region critical for spatial and declarative learning (, ). While anatomical and in\u00a0vitro physiological properties of hippocampal VIP+ INs have been previously characterized (), we lack a basic description of their activity patterns in the behaving animal. Whereas structural plasticity of VIP+ INs has been implicated in supporting spatial learning in the hippocampus (), it is unknown how the functional dynamics of these disinhibitory cells contribute to learning. To address these questions, we performed in\u00a0vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging and optogenetic manipulations of VIP+ INs in hippocampal area CA1, complemented by computational modeling of the CA1 circuit. We observed both behavior and learning-performance-related VIP+ IN responses. Optogenetic manipulation of VIP+ INs lead to alterations in learning performance and specific changes in CA1 spatial coding. Model simulations provided further insight into the possible origin of experimental results and point to a key disinhibitory role of VIP+ IN in spatially guided reward learning. To test whether VIP+ INs exert a disinhibitory influence over CA1 pyramidal cells (CA1PCs), we first injected rAAV2/1:Syn-(ArchT-tdTomato)Cre in area CA1 of the dorsal hippocampus in VIP-IRES-Cre mice. We confirmed that 96% of the Cre-expressing cells in this line were indeed immunopositive for VIP (Figure\u00a01A). We next carried out whole-cell current-clamp recordings from CA1PCs in acute hippocampal slices and measured responses to electrical stimulation of Schaffer collateral inputs while optogenetically silencing CA1 VIP+ INs on alternating trials (Figure\u00a01B). We observed a significant increase in evoked post-synaptic inhibition on CA1PCs when VIP+ INs were optogenetically silenced. To assess this disinhibition in\u00a0vivo, we next\u00a0injected\u00a0rAAV2/9:EF1\u03b1-(bReaChES-tdTomato)Cre along with rAAV2/1:CaMKII-GCaMP6f into CA1 in VIP-IRES-Cre mice to record Ca2+ activity in CA1PCs while optogenetically exciting VIP+ INs with a red-shifted optogenetic actuator (). Mice were implanted with a head-post and imaging window above dorsal CA1 (Figure\u00a01C, left; see STAR Methods; , ) and trained to run on a linear treadmill for a water reward during a random-foraging (RF) task (). We found that optogenetic activation of VIP+ INs significantly increased the amplitude (\u0394F/F) and area under the curve (AUC, see STAR Methods) of identified Ca2+ transients in CA1PCs (Figures 1C and 1D), whereas CA1PCs in control mice injected with rAAV2/1:Syn-(tdTomato)Cre and rAAV2/1:CaMKII-GCaMP6f showed no significant activity changes in response to light (Figures 1C, 1D, S2A, and S2B). Together, these results demonstrate that VIP+ INs have a net disinhibitory role in regulating CA1PC activity. We next sought to characterize the in\u00a0vivo activity patterns of\u00a0VIP+ INs during behavior. We injected rAAV2/1:EF1\u03b1-(GCaMP6f)Cre in dorsal CA1 of VIP-IRES-Cre mice and recorded Ca2+ dynamics of VIP+ INs in behaving mice. We focused on VIP+ INs in the CA1 stratum pyramidale, where the majority (53%) of these INs are located and identifiable as IN-targeting based on high level of calretinin (CR) (48%) and low level of cholecystokinin (CCK) co-expression (8%) (Figures S1A and S1B; , , , ). We first assessed the modulation of VIP+ INs by behavioral states. Head-fixed mice were trained to run on a cue-rich treadmill belt in a multisensory context for randomly administered water rewards (Figures 2A and 2B; random foraging [RF]; , ). We found that Ca2+activity was positively correlated with running velocity in 82% of VIP+ INs with peak activity lagging the animal\u2019s velocity (Figure\u00a02B). In the remaining 18% of cells, Ca2+ activity showed shorter latency and negative correlation with velocity (Figures 2B and S2C). Therefore, we partitioned the VIP+ IN population into two functional groups for subsequent analysis: positively velocity modulated (PVM) and negatively velocity modulated (NVM), based on the sign of peak correlations with velocity (Figures 2A and 2B; PVM: red, NVM: blue). We found that this classification was relatively stable from day to day during RF (Figure\u00a0S2D). The short-latency, negative velocity correlations in the NVM group implied that these cells were more active after the animal stopped running. To investigate this further, we examined changes in the activity of VIP+ INs aligned to the onset and offset of locomotion (Figures 2C\u20132E and S2E). We calculated the response reliability of each cell to these events (see STAR Methods) and found that most VIP+ INs in the PVM group (Figure\u00a02C, top) showed either an increase or no change in Ca2+ activity after running start, and decreased Ca2+ activity after running stop. The NVM group showed the converse relationship (Figure\u00a02C, bottom). To determine whether VIP+ IN responses to locomotion are transient or persistent during steady-state locomotion, we compared the mean \u0394F/F for each neuron during periods of prolonged (\u22659 s) running or resting (see STAR Methods). The majority (76%) of PVM VIP+ INs displayed reliably elevated activity when the animal was running, while 42% of NVM VIP+ INs reliably decreased their Ca2+ activity; the remaining (58%) showed no reliable change (Figure\u00a02F). In addition, we observed significant spatial tuning in a subset of CA1 VIP+ INs during RF (29%; Figure\u00a0S2G). Together, these results demonstrate that, similar to other hippocampal IN subtypes (, , , , , ), a majority of VIP+ INs are strongly and positively modulated by locomotion while a subset showed negative modulation. By\u00a0comparison, parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) INs in the CA1 stratum pyramidale of PV-IRES-Cre mice exhibited a more homogeneous, positively modulated velocity response profile (99.4% of cells) while a small proportion of somatostatin-expressing (SOM+) INs (8.4%) in the CA1 stratum oriens in SOM-IRES-Cre mice also displayed strong negative modulation by locomotion (Figure\u00a0S3A; ). Interestingly, the negatively correlated SOM+ INs exhibited more negative modulation than VIP+ INs in the NVM group (2-sample t test on Fisher Z-Transformation of r values, t\u00a0= 4.56, p\u00a0= 0.00014, data not shown). Also congruent with PVM response profiles, simultaneous imaging and local field potential recordings revealed that PVM activity was more correlated than NVM activity with running-associated theta band (5\u201310\u00a0Hz) power (Figure\u00a0S3B). These functionally identified groups of VIP+ INs could possibly align with neurochemically defined subgroups of VIP+ INs expressing CR or CCK; the latter specifies a subset of INs that target the perisomatic region of pyramidal cells (VIP+/CCK+ basket cells) (, , ) and represents a small fraction of the VIP+ INs in the CA1 pyramidal layer (8%; Figure\u00a0S1B; ). Therefore, we computed the fraction of all imaged VIP+ INs that belonged to each functional group and compared these to\u00a0the fractions from neurons identified by post hoc immunostaining of secondary neurochemical markers (Figure\u00a0S1C). We found that CCK-negative VIP+ INs (CR-positive or CR-negative) showed PVM-NVM fractions similar to the total recorded population, suggesting that the majority of PVM VIP+ INs are disinhibitory VIP+ INs. In contrast, within the CCK-positive VIP+ INs, the NVM group was significantly enriched (Figure\u00a0S1D). Together, these results show heterogeneous locomotion-related response profiles in CA1 VIP+ INs, where the majority of cells are positively modulated by velocity and a subset show negative velocity modulation. We next explored whether VIP+ IN activity is modulated by features of spatial navigation beyond locomotion. To this end, we trained mice in a head-fixed goal-oriented learning (GOL) task (Figure\u00a03A; see STAR Methods) in which operant water rewards are delivered at a fixed treadmill location and mice learn to lick selectively near this \u201chidden\u201d reward location (Figure\u00a03A; , ). We recorded the activity of the same VIP+ INs (n\u00a0= 253 cells) throughout the GOL task and classified these cells into PVM and NVM groups (Figure\u00a03B) as in RF. VIP+ INs showed similar overall stability from day to day compared to RF (Figure\u00a0S2D, GOL). However, since mice must learn and remember the location of the goal zone and lick actively to receive reward, we expected that VIP+ INs might respond differently to expected reward delivery compared to RF. Indeed, the fraction of cells that reliably changed their activity (Figures 3C and 3D) in response to reward delivery was significantly higher for the GOL task (90%) compared to RF (44%) (Figures 3C and 3D), but the level of responses is not significantly different between tasks (Figure\u00a0S2F). Once the task is learned, mice run toward the reward location and then briefly stop in the reward zone during the time of the reward delivery, which can result in mixed locomotion and reward-related Ca2+ responses in VIP+ INs. To isolate the locomotion-related and reward-related components, we first analyzed how reward delivery modulated responses during running-stop events only. We found that a significantly larger fraction of cells was modulated by reward delivery in the GOL task compared to RF (Figure\u00a04A, left). Significantly modulated VIP+ INs in the NVM group were predominantly positively modulated by reward, while PVM VIP+ INs did not show bias to either direction however the reward-related transients in the positively modulated groups were significantly higher in the GOL task (Figure\u00a04A, right). Together, these results indicate that the spatial memory-dependent GOL task accentuates the responses of VIP+ INs during running stops in the presence of reward. To investigate whether reward responses in GOL are modulated by learning, we correlated the modulation of the Ca2+ activity in VIP+ INs during rewarded and unrewarded running-stop events with learning performance. Reward modulation of the mean Ca2+ activity for 3\u00a0s before (Figure\u00a04B) and 3\u00a0s after (Figure\u00a04C) running-stop events was positively correlated with learning performance in PVM but not NVM VIP+ INs. However, velocity preceding 3\u00a0s of running-stop events was also significantly higher for rewarded compared to unrewarded events (Figure\u00a0S3C), which raised the question of whether the observed correlations in the PVM group are due to reward modulation of velocity or to reward delivery. To control the effect of reward modulation over velocity, we computed the partial correlation between reward modulation of VIP+ IN running-stop activity and learning performance (see STAR Methods; Figure\u00a0S3D) and found that the positive correlation in Figure\u00a04 remained. These results indicate that the running-stop responses of VIP+ INs in GOL are modulated by reward beyond the modulation explained by locomotion. We additionally designed a model-based approach to isolate the specific contributions of behavioral covariates for predicting the activity of VIP+ INs and predict whether these relationships changed with learning in the GOL task. We used a generalized linear model (GLM) (, ) to fit VIP+ INs Ca2+ activity as a linear function of all behavioral variables (Figure\u00a05A; see STAR Methods). Behavioral variables predicted a similar fraction of variance in both PVM and NVM VIP+ IN groups (Figure\u00a05B, left, r2: PVM: 0.28 (0.18\u20130.40), NVM: 0.27 (0.17\u20130.39) median (interquartile range); 2-sample t test, t\u00a0= 0.74, p\u00a0= 0.45, \u03b1\u00a0= 0.05). We next divided the behavioral variables into 3 groups (reward, locomotion, and position) and computed the predictive information each variable group contributed to the model via a cross-validated log likelihood ratio (LLR) approach (Figure\u00a05B, right; see STAR Methods). Each group contributed some independent information about VIP+ IN activity, congruent with our prior result that reward modulation is not fully explained by locomotion. Similarly, we found that the independent information gained from locomotion and reward variables exhibited negative and positive correlations respectively with learning performance of the animals (Figure\u00a05C). This analysis demonstrates that reward-related variables become increasingly predictive of VIP activity as animals learn, beyond the expected change from differences in the other behavioral parameters. Since the position variables were most informative (Figure\u00a05B), we further examined their contribution during learning. Information gained from position was only weakly correlated with learning performance (Figure\u00a05D). However, we found that positions around the reward zone contributed the largest source of information (Figure\u00a05D). While the information gained from positions at the reward zone was not significantly correlated with learning performance, the information from positions away from the reward zone was negatively correlated (Figure\u00a05E). Correspondingly, the difference in information gained between near and away positions was significantly positively correlated with learning performance (Figure\u00a05F). These results indicate that, as the performance of the animal increased during the GOL task, VIP+ INs are increasingly more responsive to the reward and reward position-related variables. To explore potential anatomical sources of reward-related and space-related signals to CA1 VIP+ INs, we used monosynaptic retrograde rabies virus tracing (; Figure\u00a0S4). We found high numbers of presynaptic cells in reward-related neuromodulatory subcortical nuclei, including the septal and medial raphe nuclei, and scattered labeling in the ventral tegmental area. Hippocampal areas such as CA1, CA2, and CA3 and entorhinal-perirhinal regions (Figure\u00a0S4K) contained high to moderate number of presynaptically labeled cells. Thus, CA1 VIP+ INs receive diverse inputs from hippocampal, cortical, and subcortical sources capable of transmitting reward- and position-related information. If positive modulation of VIP+ IN activity by reward delivery plays an active role in spatially guided reward learning, then manipulating the activity of these local disinhibitory INs may alter learning performance in the GOL task. We tested this hypothesis via optogenetic manipulation of VIP+ INs. VIP-IRES-Cre mice were injected bilaterally in CA1 with a Cre-dependent rAAV, driving expression of either channelrhodopsin (VIP-ChR2, 4 mice), archaerhodopsinT (VIP-ArchT, 9 mice), or GFP (VIP-GFP, 7 mice) and then implanted with optic fibers above dorsal CA1 (Figure\u00a0S5A). Mice were trained in the GOL task for 3 consecutive days for one reward location without optogenetic manipulation and showed similar learning performance across groups (Figure\u00a06A, days 1\u20133). Subsequently, mice were trained on a new reward location for the next 3\u00a0days, where we applied laser stimulation in a 70\u00a0cm segment of the belt centered around the new reward zone to increase (ChR2) or decrease (ArchT) activity of VIP+ INs (Figure\u00a06A, days 4\u20136; see STAR Methods). Licking and locomotion were similar between groups (Figure\u00a0S5B), indicating that our manipulations did not impair the animals\u2019 ability to run or to seek reward. We found that VIP-ChR2 mice learned significantly faster than VIP-GFP controls, whereas VIP-ArchT mice achieved significantly worse performance (Figure\u00a06A). We next investigated how peri-reward VIP+ IN activity might regulate CA1PC dynamics during learning. Previous studies have demonstrated (, , , ) that CA1PC place cells over-represent reward locations during the GOL task and that the magnitude of place cell enrichment predicts learning performance. We hypothesized that, if peri-reward VIP+ IN activity near reward is involved in this recruitment, then inhibiting VIP+ INs should impair the recruitment of extra place cells near the reward (Figure\u00a06B). Figures 6E and 6F show that, given the laser stimulation in the 70\u00a0cm of the belt centered around the reward during learning, the VIP-GFP mice (n\u00a0= 7) showed enrichment of place cells near the reward after learning, while the enrichment was absent in VIP-ArchT mice (n\u00a0= 5). We did not observe a significant difference between the transient rate or transient AUC of CA1PC place cells (Figure\u00a06C), the fraction of place cells, or the width of place fields between VIP-GFP and VIP-ArchT mice (Figure\u00a06D). Notably, optogenetically enhanced VIP+ disinhibition was insufficient to induce reorganization of CA1PCs place cells in a fixed, unrewarded zone of the treadmill belt during the RF task (Figure\u00a0S5C). Together, these results indicate that VIP+ IN-mediated disinhibition is necessary, but not sufficient, to drive learning performance-related reorganization of CA1PC activity during learning. As VIP+ INs can have both direct (inhibitory) and indirect (disinhibitory) effects on CA1PC activity depending on CCK expression, we sought to clarify the interpretation of our experimental observations by developing a detailed biophysical model of the CA1 circuit that could dissect the contributions of different subgroups of VIP+ INs to spatial encoding. Our model, consisting of CA1PCs and six types of INs, was validated against experimental data with respect to passive and active electrophysiological properties, connectivity profiles, and input patterns (Figures 7A, 7B, and S6; STAR Methods). To generate place-cell-like activity in model CA1PCs as in GOL, we introduced convergent entorhinal cortical (EC) input as multiple grids covering a virtual linear track (Figure\u00a07C; see STAR Methods). The effect of reward-based learning was simulated as an increase in the strength of EC and CA3 connections onto all CA1PCs whose firing rates within the reward zone exceeded a set threshold (see STAR Methods). This implementation reproduced GOL-induced place cell enrichment (Figures 8A and 8C, control), similar to experimental observations (Figures 6E and 6F), resulting primarily from recruitment of previously silent place cells. Our model also predicts a locomotion-induced increase in place cell representation of reward location (Figures 8B and 8D). This increase, however, is much smaller than the one induced by learning, corroborating our experimental data (Figure\u00a0S3D). To further clarify the role of VIP+ INs during spatial learning, we independently simulated the deletion of each VIP+ IN subtype (VIP+/CR+, VIP+/CCK+) as well as our functionally identified subgroups (VIP-PVM, VIP-NVM). Simulations were performed under three conditions: before learning (Figure\u00a08A, Pre-learning), with learning-related changes in locomotion but no synaptic plasticity (Figure\u00a08B, Locomotion), and after learning the GOL task (locomotion and synaptic plasticity, Figure\u00a08C, Post-learning). In agreement with experimental results, deletion of all VIP+ INs (No VIP) reduced the fraction of CA1PCs encoding reward location post-learning (Figure\u00a08D) and lowered the mean firing rates of CA1PCs (Figure\u00a08E). To investigate whether this effect was primarily mediated by inhibitory (i.e., CCK+) or disinhibitory (i.e., CR+) VIP+ INs, we independently deleted each of these subpopulations in the model circuit. VIP+/CR+ deletion led to a reduction in both the fraction of CA1PC encoding the reward locations (Figure\u00a08D) and the mean firing rates of all modeled place cells, similar to that of removing all VIP+ cells (Figure\u00a08E). In contrast, removal of VIP+/CCK+ cells had no effect on reward encoding (Figure\u00a08D) or the firing rates of CA1PC firing rates (Figure\u00a08E). Respective manipulations of the VIP-PVM and VIP-NVM populations had similar, dampening effects on both enrichment (Figure\u00a08D) and mean CA1PC firing rates (Figure\u00a08E), suggesting similar contributions of these two functional sub-classes of VIP+ INs. These modeling results predict that VIP+ INs affect spatial encoding primarily via their disinhibitory connections onto Basket and Oriens-lacunosum moleculare (OLM) INs (Figure\u00a0S7). Moreover, in line with the experimental data (Figure\u00a0S2G), some VIP+ model INs exhibit spatial tuning prior learning (Figure\u00a0S8). However, the percentage of these VIP+ INs is rather low (\u223c15% in the model, \u223c29% in experiments), and their tuning is weaker than that of CA1PCs (Figure\u00a0S2G), suggesting a limited\u00a0contribution to GOL. Taken together, modeling and experimental results demonstrate that VIP+ IN activity near the reward location plays an active role in goal-directed spatial learning and regulates goal-directed reorganization of hippocampal spatial maps. Prior work has characterized in\u00a0vivo activity patterns of several hippocampal IN types using primarily electrophysiological approaches (). However, there is still limited information available regarding in\u00a0vivo activity of VIP+ INs, which comprises the major class of disinhibitory INs in the hippocampus (, , , , ). Our in\u00a0vivo functional imaging study provides the first such characterization of activity profiles of hippocampal VIP+ INs in multiple behavioral settings. Similar to neocortical areas (, ) and other IN types in the hippocampus (, , ), including disinhibitory INs located in the CA1 alveus-oriens (), we found strong locomotion-related activation in the majority of CA1 VIP+ INs. Relatedly, we observed spatial tuning in a subset of CA1 VIP+ INs as has been reported for other IN types (, , , ) and is replicated by our computational model. However, we also found that a subgroup of hippocampal VIP+ INs responded primarily to the termination of locomotion. This response pattern was largely unobserved in hippocampal PV+ INs but was present in a subset of SOM+ CA1 INs, consistent with previous observations (). In our imaging experiments, we focused on VIP+ INs located in the CA1 pyramidal layer amenable to large-scale imaging. Nevertheless, in future experiments it will be important to carry out a comparative characterization of VIP+ INs located\u00a0in dendritic layers of CA1 (, , ). In\u00a0addition, we note that, although our in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro optogenetic experiments demonstrate a net disinhibitory influence of VIP+ INs on CA1PC activity in the VIP-IRES-Cre mouse\u00a0line, INs labeled with this single-marker strategy certainly also include other direct, inhibitory INs; for example, VIP+/CCK+ basket cells. Notably, we tended to observe a higher fraction of NVM cells within the anatomically identified subset of VIP+/CCK+ INs, which might indicate that CCK+ basket cells also play an active role in organizing hippocampal ensemble dynamics during spatial learning (, ). In addition to locomotion and position signals, we found that VIP+ INs are also modulated by the presence of reward and that this activity strongly depends on task demands: a large population of VIP+ INs exhibited significant task modulation in a GOL task, where the animal learned to associate the reward with a certain spatial location on the treadmill belt. In contrast, behavioral tasks without a learning component recruited smaller task-responsive populations, whose response magnitude was significantly diminished compared to those observed in the goal-oriented task. Further, VIP+ IN activity during the GOL task contained a spatial component associated with the reward location beyond that expected from locomotion and reward-driven responses and could be related to reward anticipation. These results indicate that activity in hippocampal disinhibitory circuits contains a mixture of information about both idiothetic and task variables, where the latter is expressed differentially according to behavioral demands. Our results extend upon previous studies demonstrating that hippocampal GABAergic INs are not static elements of the hippocampal circuitry but rather change their firing activity throughout the course of learning (, , ). Multi-unit recordings in freely moving rats have demonstrated that changes in the firing rate of CA1 INs correlate either positively or negatively with pyramidal cells\u2019 spatial coding as rats learn reward locations, suggesting that INs may actively regulate learning-performance-related reorganization of the hippocampal place map (). In concert with this observation, here we found that VIP+ disinhibitory circuits in hippocampal area CA1 also undergo learning-performance-related modulation as mice learn to forage for rewards in a goal-directed spatial learning task. We hypothesize that this enhanced recruitment of hippocampal VIP+ INs is driven by the dynamics of external reinforcement signals, mirroring observations in auditory and prefrontal cortices () where disinhibitory circuits are strongly engaged by reinforcement signals to regulate the gain of local principal cell responses. Subcortical neuromodulatory inputs provide an attractive candidate for conveying such a reinforcement signal and have been implicated in signaling reward-related information in the cortex (, , ). Indeed, we have shown that VIP+ INs receive monosynaptic input from several neuromodulatory centers, including direct connections from cholinergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic nuclei. This is consistent with our hypothesis that reward-related, external neuromodulatory signals can directly influence the activity of hippocampal VIP+ INs similar to what has been demonstrated for VIP+ INs in neocortical circuits (, , , , ). Future work may permit causal linkage of external inputs to VIP+ IN recruitment in the hippocampus. Alternatively, it is possible that the performance-related changes we observed in VIP+ IN population dynamics during learning were driven primarily by intrinsic circuit dynamics of CA1. While disinhibition enabled by VIP+ INs could promote the place cell enrichment near reward zones observed during the GOL task (, , , ), pyramidal cells may directly receive sufficient reinforcement signals to drive this representational shift. Here VIP+ IN circuits could serve to amplify and maintain enhanced pyramidal cell activity at the reward zone through local feedback circuits, in which pyramidal cells provide an enhanced excitatory drive to VIP+ INs, reciprocating further local disinhibition and resulting in a spatially localized reduction in \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d dynamics. Our finding that optogenetic activation of VIP+ INs alone is not sufficient to induce place cell remapping would be consistent with this interpretation. The functional clustering of VIP+ INs we observe may derive from differences in feedback connectivity from local pyramidal cells, leading to differences in locomotion responsivity and learning-performance-related dynamics. However, future work will be required to precisely link single-cell functional and molecular heterogeneity in hippocampal disinhibitory circuits and to determine how these are related to the observed dynamics during learning. Last, we demonstrate that optogenetic manipulation of hippocampal disinhibitory tone can bi-directionally affect spatial learning performance. This parallels observations in prefrontal cortex where optogenetic activation of VIP+ INs enhanced learning performance (). Optogenetic suppression of VIP+ INs when the animal was near the reward location impaired learning performance and ablated place cell enrichment. Our genetic strategy is admittedly limited to nonspecific labeling of CA1 VIP+ populations, which includes VIP+/CCK+ INs that directly target CA1PCs. However, these results are consistent with an interpretation that disinhibition provided by VIP+ INs could suppress inhibition to CA1PCs near the reward, thereby facilitating synaptic and intrinsic plasticity in a functional subset of pyramidal cells (, , , , ). This may manifest as a structured remapping of place cells toward the reward zone (, , ). We found that optogenetic activation of VIP+ INs alone was not sufficient to induce place cell remapping. This suggests that reward zone-related plasticity of CA1PC place cells requires conjunctive interactions from multiple inputs on CA1PCs, including spatial, sensory, disinhibitory, and neuromodulatory modalities (). Disinhibition mediated by VIP+ INs could regulate performance-related reorganization of hippocampal pyramidal cell assemblies during learning through multiple downstream targets. In the neocortex, VIP+ INs primarily innervate SOM+ INs and, to lesser extent, PV+ INs (, , , ). Efferent targets of hippocampal VIP+ INs are less well characterized likely include multiple different IN types (, , , ). While our study did not investigate the direct effects of VIP disinhibition on different potential IN targets, disinhibition of either perisomatic or dendrite-targeting INs could play a role in regulating learning-performance-related hippocampal place cell dynamics. For instance, disinhibition through suppressing dendrite-targeting SOM+ IN activity could enhance dendritic electrogenesis and burst firing in pyramidal cells (, ), facilitating place cell formation and plasticity (, , ). Indeed, the negative velocity modulation we observe in a subset of SOM+ INs during RF could arise from inhibition by PVM VIP+ INs. On the other hand, disinhibition of pyramidal cells through suppressing perisomatic targeting PV+ INs (basket and axo-axonic cells) could also enhance network excitability during memory encoding (). The predominant positive velocity modulation we observe for PV+ INs and for the majority of SOM+ INs during RF (Figure\u00a0S3A) suggests that VIP+ INs modulate, rather than completely suppress activity of their downstream targets. Our model simulations predict an important inhibitory influence of VIP+/CR+ and VIP PVM cells on both SOM+ OLM INs (Figure\u00a0S7A) and PV+ basket cells (Figure\u00a0S7B). Moreover, selective removal of specific VIP+/CR+ connections to these INs is shown in the model to dampen enrichment (Figure\u00a0S7C), suggesting that the VIP+ disinhibitory action on spatial learning is mediated by targeted connections to perisomatic and less to dendrite-targeting INs. Nevertheless, in future studies it will be important to characterize learning-associated changes in the population dynamics of other identified hippocampal INs subtypes (, , , ) and to dissect the role of VIP+ INs in this process. On the basis of our observations, we propose that the VIP circuit motif of the hippocampal CA1 region, similar to its neocortical counterpart, is a key task-adaptable component of cortical learning mechanisms. Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Attila Losonczy (al2856@columbia.edu). All experiments were conducted in accordance with the NIH guidelines and with the approval of the Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Experiments were performed with healthy adult, heterozygous male and female VIP-IRES-Cre mice (Jackson Laboratory, Stock No: 010908) crossed with C57/Bl6 mice or with the Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter line (Jackson Laboratory, Stock No: 007909; B6;129S6-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm9(CAG-tdTomato)Hze/J, Ai9). For comparing VIP+ INs activity with PV+ and SOM+ INs, we used heterozygous male and female Pvalb-IRES-Cre and Som-IRES-Cre knock-in mice generated by Dr. Boris Zemelman (). Mice were kept in the vivarium on a reversed 12-h light/dark cycle and were housed 3-5 mice in each cage. Experiments were performed during the dark portion of the cycle. Cre-dependent recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) expressing GCaMP6f under the EF1\u03b1 promoter (rAAV2/1:EF1\u03b1-(GCaMP6f)Cre), was used for expressing GCaMP6f in VIP+ INs for imaging experiments (Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, S1C, S1D, and S2C\u2013S2G) and for imaging PV+ and SOM+ INs (Figure\u00a0S3). For in\u00a0vitro electrophysiological recordings (Figure\u00a01B) VIP-IRES-Cre mice were injected with rAAV2/1:Syn-(ArchT-tdTomato)Cre in the dorsal CA1. For optogenetic manipulation of\u00a0VIP+ INs during the head-fixed GOL task (Figure\u00a06A), mice were injected bilaterally in the dorsal hippocampal area CA1 with rAAV2/1:Syn-(ChR2-GFP)Cre or rAAV2/1:Syn-(ArchT-tdTomato)Cre viruses and rAAV2/1:Syn-(GFP)Cre or rAAV2/1:Syn-(tdTomato)Cre as controls, respectively. To simultaneously image CA1 pyramidal cells and manipulate VIP+ INs (Figure\u00a01) we injected mice unilaterally with a 1:1 mixture of rAAV2/1:CaMKII-GCaMP6f and rAAV2/1:Syn-(ArchT-tdTomato)Cre (Figures S2A and S2B) or with a 1:1 mixture of rAAV2/9:EF1\u03b1-(bReaChES-tdTomato)Cre () and rAAV2/1:CaMKII-GCaMP6f virus (Figures 1C and 1D). Consistent with the reported limited specificity of the CaMKII rAAV promoter to label selectively excitatory neurons (, , ), we observed that the CaMKII promoter-driven rAAV led to GCaMP expression in both pyramidal cells and interneurons. Therefore, VIP+ INs were identified based on their Cre-dependent tdTomato expression. Viral injection and imaging window implant procedures are described in details elsewhere (, ). Briefly, viruses were stereotactically injected into the dorsal CA1 (coordinates relative to Bregma: anterio-posterior \u22122.2, medio-lateral 1.6, dorso-ventral: \u22121.2, \u22121.1, \u22121.0) of adult mice using thin glass pipettes (20-30 nL virus at each dorsoventral spot) and Nanoject II injectors (Drummond Scientific). Mice were returned to their home cage for 3\u00a0days before window implantation. After the recovery period mice were surgically implanted with an imaging window (diameter, 3.0\u00a0mm; height, 1.5\u00a0mm) over the left dorso-intermediate hippocampus and with a stainless-steel head-post for head fixation during imaging. Imaging cannulas were constructed by adhering (Norland optical adhesive) a 3-mm glass coverslip (64-0720, Warner) to a cylindrical steel cannula. For head-fixed optogenetic manipulations we used published techniques () for the construction of chronically dwelling optical fibers and patch cables for optogenetic behavioral procedures (Thorlabs). For all experiments, a 200\u00a0\u03bcm core, 0.37 numerical aperture (NA) multimode fiber was used (Thorlabs) for optical stimulation via a patch cable (Thorlabs) connected to either a 100 mw 593.5 or 473\u00a0nm laser diode (CrystaLaser) to activate ArchT or ChR2, respectively (laser power was set to 20 mW measured at the tip of the fiber: \u223c634\u00a0mW/mm2). Adult mice were surgically implanted bilaterally with fiber optic cannulas using published protocols () over the dorsal hippocampal CA1. The positioning of the ferrules and the expression of the opsins were verified post hoc following the end of the recording sessions (Figure\u00a0S5A). All imaging was conducted using a two-photon microscope equipped with an 8 kHz resonant scanner (Bruker). For excitation, we used 50-100 mW laser power under the objective (Chameleon Ultra II, Coherent or Insight X3, Spectra Physics tuned to 920\u00a0nm or 940\u00a0nm, respectively). Red (tdTomato) and green (GCaMP6f) channels were separated by an emission cube set (green, HQ525/70 m-2p; red, HQ607/45 m-2p; 575dcxr, Chroma Technology), and fluorescence signals were collected with photomultiplier tubes (GCaMP fluorescence, GaAsP PMT, Hamamatsu Model 7422P-40). A custom dual stage preamp (1.43105 dB, Bruker) was used to amplify signals prior to digitization. For the consecutive imaging and optogenetic manipulation and Ca2+ recording in Figures 6 and S5C we imaged the mice in the first running session and then we placed a laser (593\u00a0nm) coupled optical fiber above the hippocampal window in the consecutive 7 running sessions. Finally, we imaged the mice again in the last (9th) session without the laser. To image VIP+ INs\u2019 Ca2+ activity and correlate it with LFP, we first injected mice with rAAV2/1:EF1\u03b1-GCaMP6f in the left dorsal hippocampus. We then implanted mice with hippocampal imaging windows over the left injected area and inserted a chronic, 4-site silicon probe (Qtrode, Neuronexus) in the contralateral CA1 at a 45\u00b0 angle (coordinates: antero-posterior: \u22122.3\u00a0mm, mediolateral: 2.75\u00a0mm, dorsoventral: \u22120.975\u00a0mm). We secured the probe in place with dental acrylic and let the mouse recover for 3\u00a0days before the start of training. LFP signals were recorded with a multichannel recording system (Intan Technologies) synchronized with the two-photon microscope. The correct position of the recording electrode was verified by the presence of sharp-wave ripple events in the traces and in some cases with histology. LFP signals were recorded at 25 kHz and down sampled to 1250\u00a0Hz. In order to validate the disinhibitory effect of VIP+ INs on CA1 pyramidal cells (Figure\u00a01C), and to assess the effect of VIP+ IN activation on CA1 place cell dynamics in the absence of reward (Figure\u00a05C) we carried out simultaneous Ca2+ imaging and photostimulation experiments where we used 620\u00a0nm light to excite opsin expressing neurons delivered via an LED coupled to the 2-photon microscope. For optogenetic activation of VIP+ INs, we injected VIP-IRES-Cre mice in dorsal CA1 with a 1:1 mixture of rAAV2/9:EF1\u03b1-(bReaChES-tdTomato)Cre and rAAV2/1:CaMKII-GCaMP6f virus. To inhibit VIP+ INs, we injected VIP-IRES-Cre mice in dorsal CA1 with a 1:1 mixture of rAAV2/1:Syn-(ArchT-tdTomato)Cre and rAAV2/1:CaMKII-GCaMP6f viruses. This labeling strategy resulted in pyramidal cells expressing only GCaMP6f while VIP+ cells expressed both GCaMP6f and the opsin. Control mice groups were injected with a 1:1 mixture of rAAV2/1:Syn-(tdTomato)Cre and rAAV2/1:CaMKII-GCaMP6f viruses. To avoid saturating the PMTs during recording sessions when the opsins were activated, we used a fast response time LED (Prizmatix, 620\u00a0nm) and custom-made electronics to trigger light pulses on the fly back time of the galvanometer when there is no image acquisition. The average power of the LED was 10-20 mW measured under the objective. This approach allowed us to protect our PMTs from the high intensity illumination but still take the advantage of the fast, full frame resonant galvo scanning without losing any frames during photostimulation. Transcardial perfusions, hippocampal microdissections, and sectioning were carried out using ice-cold dissection solution containing 195\u00a0mM sucrose, 10\u00a0mM NaCl, 15\u00a0mM dextrose, 26\u00a0mM NaHCO3, 2.5\u00a0mM KCl, 1.25\u00a0mM NaH2PO4, 1\u00a0mM CaCl2, 2\u00a0mM MgCl2\u00b76H2O. During recordings, slices were continuously perfused at 32\u00b0C with ACSF containing 125\u00a0mM NaCl, 10\u00a0mM dextrose, 26\u00a0mM NaHCO3, 2.5\u00a0mM KCl, 1.25\u00a0mM NaH2PO4, 2\u00a0mM Na-pyruvate, 2\u00a0mM CaCl2, 1\u00a0mM MgCl2\u00b76H2O. Dissection solution and ACSF were carbogenated to saturation at all times and were calibrated to pH 7.3-7.4 and osmolality 310\u00a0\u00b1 5 mOsm. Whole cell current clamp recordings were performed using a K-gluconate-based internal solution (130\u00a0mM K-gluconate, 8\u00a0mM KCl, 10\u00a0mM HEPES, 4\u00a0mM NaCl, 4\u00a0mM Mg2ATP, 0.3\u00a0mM Tris2GTP, 14\u00a0mM (tris-)phosphocreatine) with pH\u00a0= 7.28 and osmolality 295 mOsm. 2-4\u00a0weeks after viral injection of rAAV2/1:EF1\u03b1-(ArchT-tdTomato)Cre in dorsal CA1 of VIP-IRES-Cre mice, (8-10\u00a0week old) animals were transcardially perfused with ice-cold, carbogenated high-sucrose dissection solution under continuous isoflurane anesthesia (3%\u20135% induction, 2% maintenance). Brains were quickly removed and placed in ice-cold dissection solution where hippocampi were dissected out, embedded in 4% agar blocks, and sliced in the same solution using a Leica VT1200S vibratome for 400\u00a0\u03bcm-thick transverse sections. Slices recovered in ACSF at 32\u00b0C for 20-30\u00a0min and were then held at room temperature until used for recording. Whole-cell current clamp recordings were carried out at 32\u00b0C in ACSF using borosilicate glass pipettes. Data were acquired using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier and Digidata 1440A digitizer (Molecular Devices). Data were digitized at 50 kHz and low-pass filtered at 1 kHz. Because measurements were made within-cell, experimental factors such as series resistance and whole cell capacitance were not compensated. While recording pyramidal cells in ArchT-expressing slices, Schaffer collateral fibers were stimulated in stratum radiatum by a glass pipet filled with 1\u00a0mM NaCl. Stimuli were delivered across a range of increasing intensities (7 sweeps per intensity) while a 532\u00a0nm laser (Opto Engine) was triggered on every other sweep to deliver green light through a ferrule submerged in the perfusion chamber. Laser onset preceded electrical stimulation by 50\u00a0ms and lasted for the duration of the pyramidal cell response. Mild positive holding current was sometimes used to hold pyramidal cells between \u221258 and \u221265\u00a0mV to improve visibility of IPSPs. To assess evoked inhibition onto pyramidal cells, the IPSP was bracketed in time and integrated with respect to baseline membrane potential. For each recording, laser effect was measured separately for each stimulation intensity by calculating the mean IPSP integral from three laser-OFF and three laser-ON sweeps. To avoid a systematic bias due to order of testing, analysis alternately began on the first or second of 7 trials for each intensity, i.e., starting the analysis with laser off versus on. Analyses were carried out in MATLAB (Mathworks). Head-fixed mice ran on a 2-m long treadmill belt equipped with a water delivery port and custom made electronics required for recording the mice\u2019s licking and its position on the belt. We started to habituate the mice to the head-fixed condition 3-4\u00a0days after the head-post implant procedure. Water deprived mice were trained to run on a cue-less belt to run and seek reward by licking the lick port. The training period typically lasted for 10-14\u00a0days or until the mice were able to run reliably for at least 10 laps in 10\u00a0min while licking continuously for reward. In imaging experiments for measuring the disinhibitory effect of VIP+ IN activation (Figure\u00a01C), the optogenetics LED was triggered on alternating laps for 40% (80cm) of the lap around a fixed position. For RF, animals ran on the belt and water rewards were delivered randomly (without requiring the animal to lick the lick port to solicit the reward) on either a cued belt (Figures 2, 3, 4, and S5B). Animals performed this task for 3x10\u00a0minute sessions per day for either two days (Figure\u00a02) or 3\u00a0days (Figure\u00a0S5B). For the goal oriented learning task (GOL, Figures 3 and 6), animals learned to seek reward at a fixed location on a cued belt. The cued belt is composed of 3 segments of fabric of different texture and with many tactile cues glued/sewed to the belt at different positions on the belt. The cues have different texture properties and different heights that let the animal sense the cues with their whiskers or their body. The cueless belt was composed of a plain burlap material. For the GOL experiments, the 10\u00a0cm size reward zone was set to be at least 10\u00a0cm away from the closest tactile cue, so that animals did not associate the cue with the reward. All spatial information was presented to the mice via the treadmill belt. In addition, similar to head-fixed multisensory context configurations in our previous publications (, , ), a multisensory context was created using a continuous presentation of a constant odor (e.g., carvone), blinking red LED (e.g., 100-ms duration at 1\u00a0Hz) and an auditory tone (e.g., continuous beeps at 2 kHz, 100-ms duration at 1\u00a0Hz). To assess the effect of the modulation of VIP+ IN activity on learning behavior (Figure\u00a06A) and CA1 pyramidal cell activity (Figures 6B\u20136F), mice that were injected with VIP-ArchT, VIP-ChR2, and VIP-GFP (see above) were trained on the GOL behavior. The laser stimulation was set to a 70\u00a0cm segment of the belt centered around the reward zone. We used a continuous illumination strategy for activating ArchT, while for ChR we used 20Hz activation pattern with 50% duty cycle. We also included a 15\u00a0s long time out window to shut off the light delivery and protect the brain from photo-damage if the mouse spent more than 15\u00a0s in the reward zone. We applied continuous, matching color ambient LED illumination in the behavior rig to prevent mice from cuing on the light emitted by laser illumination. After the last imaging sessions mice were put under deep isoflurane anesthesia and trans-cardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1\u00a0M PBS. After overnight post-fixation in the same solution the brains were transferred to PBS until sectioning. The upper 500\u00a0\u03bcm of the brains were sectioned horizontally into 50\u00a0\u03bcm thick sections with a vibratome. The sections were incubated in a mixture of anti-GFP (1/2000), anti-pro-CCK (1/250 \u2013 1/500) and anti-Calretinin (1/200) antibodies (see Key Resources Table) for several days at 4\u00b0C, and then washed several times in PBS then transferred to the cocktail of secondary antibodies: a-chicken-AlexaFluor488 (1/500), a-rabbit-DyLight405 (1/100) or a-rabbit-AlexaFluor594 (1/200) and a-mouse-DyLight649 (1/200). After overnight incubation the sections were washed, and mounted on slides in the same orientation in the proper dorso-ventral order. The slices were scanned with a confocal microscope (Leica SP5) and then the Z stacks were visually inspected until a match with the recorded two-photon field-of-view was found. The neurochemical characteristics of the cells was determined based on the presence or absence of CCK or CR immuno-signal. Four hemizygous VIP-IRES-cre mice were injected with AAV2/1:Syn-(tdTomato)Cre virus in CA1. Two weeks after the injections the mice were deeply anaesthetized with isoflurane then transcardially perfused with 40\u00a0mL 4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in 0.1\u00a0M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. The brains were dissected out from the skull and kept in the perfusion solution overnight for postfixation. The immunocytochemical reactions were done on free-floating 50\u00a0\u03bcm thick, coronal vibratome slices. First the slices were subjected to an antigen retrieval procedure by incubating in 10\u00a0mM Sodium citrate solution supplemented with 0.05% Tween-20 (pH 6.0) at 95\u00b0C for 45\u00a0minutes. Then the sections were incubated in a cocktail of the following primary antibodies for two days: 1/8000 dilution of a-VIP raised in rabbit and 1/3000 dilution of a-RFP antibody raised in goat. The sections were then washed in PBS for several times. For detecting the VIP immunoreactivity, we applied a biotin-tyramide amplification step according to the instructions of the kit provided by the manufacturer (TSA Kit, Molecular Probes T20921). Finally, we incubated the sections in a cocktail containing avidine conjugated Cy5 (Molecular Probes, 1/400) and AlexaFluor594 conjugated anti-goat secondary antibody (1/300, Jackson ImmunoResearch). The sections were washed in PBS for several times, mounted on slides and coverslipped with Fluoromount-G mounting media. The sections were scanned with Leica SP5 confocal microscope equipped with the appropriate lasers (633\u00a0nm, 543\u00a0nm) and filter sets. We used 3-4 slices from dorsal hippocampus per mice to quantify number of the double labeled cells. Quantification of the double labeled cells were done on maximum Z projected confocal stacks (Figure\u00a01A). The method of trans-synaptic retrograde labeling is described elsewhere (). Briefly, VIP-IRES-Cre mice (n\u00a0= 4) were injected in the left dorsal CA1 with a virus cocktail containing AAV2/1:EF1\u03b1-(TVA-mCherry)Cre and AAV2/1-pAM-CAGGS:H2B-(3XHA-P2A-N2cG)Cre. Two weeks after the priming injection, the mice were injected in the same spot with pseudotyped rabies virus (ENVA-CVS-N2c\u0394G) expressing GFP. Mice were trans-cardially perfused with 4% PFA in 0.1\u00a0M PBS two weeks after the pseudotyped rabies injection. The brains were carefully removed from the skull, post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight and sliced up to 70\u00a0\u03bcm thick sections with a vibratome. GFP expression in all of the sections was enhanced with GFP immuno-staining and the HA tag in the starter cells was detected with rabbit a-HA antibody followed by incubation in donkey anti-rabbit-DyLight649. Sections were mounted, coverslipped, and scanned for the GFP signal with a stereoscope (Nikon SMZ18) equipped with a custom motorized stage (Ludle) and with a high resolution digital camera (Flash Orca, v4.2, 2048x2048 resolution). We used a low magnification objective (Nikon 1x or 1.6x) to capture the images which were opened in ImageJ and the GFP positive cells were counted in each slice with the cell counter tool. The brain areas with GFP labeled cells were identified based on the Paxinos atlas (). Hippocampal slices with the starter cell labeling were scanned with a confocal microscope (Leica SP5) and the starter cells were counted and identified on individual confocal maximum projected Z stacks. The preprocessing steps of the raw fluorescence signal were described elsewhere (, ). Briefly, the acquired frames were motion corrected with the SIMA software package (). In cases where motion artifacts were not adequately corrected, the affected data was discarded from further analysis. VIP+ INs and CA1 pyramidal cells (CA1PC) in FOVs were hand-segmented on time averaged images in ROIBuddy () or ImageJ. For INs, the raw fluorescence signal was calculated from the ROIs using SIMA package across the imaging sessions. In experiments with optogenetic manipulations of VIP+ INs with simultaneous imaging of CA1 pyramidal cells (Figures 1C, 1D, S2A, S2B, and 6D\u20136F) VIP+ interneurons were directly identified based on their tdTomato expression, while other putative interneurons located in the pyramidal layer were identified based on the lack of clear GCaMP- Ca2+ transients in them, morphological criteria, and their higher baseline fluorescence (), and were excluded from further analysis. In order to separate the CA1PC signals from potential neuropil contamination, the fluorescence signals of the CA1PC ROIs were processed using FISSA () with the following parameters: 6 neuropil subregions, \u03b1\u00a0= 0.2, and 7 signal components. We computed the relative fluorescence changes (\u0394F/F) with the baseline calculated using the method adopted from Jia et\u00a0al. () (parameters: t1: smoothing window: 1\u00a0s for PC, 10\u00a0s for INs, t2: baseline size: 15\u00a0s for PCs, 100\u00a0s for INs). Furthermore, for PCs, we detected statistically significant transients as described previously (, , ) to use in place field calculations. Further analyses of the GCaMP-Ca2+ and behavioral data were implemented in Python 2.7 and detailed below. For each statically significant transients of PCs, the AUC of the transient is computed as the sum of the Ca2+ fluorescence signal during the transient duration, normalized by frame rate. The experiments in Figures 1C, 1D, S2A, and S2B had a fixed belt spatial window where the LED is activated on alternating laps (see above). To measure the change in activity of a CA1PC to LED stimulation of VIP+ INs, we compared the mean \u0394F/F and transient AUC in the LED spatial window for LED-on laps to the same spatial window in the LED-off laps, to control for potential spatial activity of CA1PCs. Furthermore, since CA1PC activity is sparse, we restricted our analysis to those CA1PCs that had at least one transient in the LED spatial window during both LED-on laps and LED-off laps. For each Ca2+ trace triggered on an event, the mean of the pre-event activity was subtracted from the mean of the post event activity (mean \u0394F/Fpost-event \u2013 mean \u0394F/Fpre-event) to calculate the response magnitude. The time window for post-event and pre-event was 3 s. For locomotion responses (Figures 2C\u20132E), if a reward delivery event occurred within the pre or post locomotion event window (3\u00a0s pre and post), then that locomotion event was excluded. This was to avoid potentially mixing reward responses with locomotion responses. The exception to this was when we specifically examine the running-stop events that co-occurs with reward delivery (Figure\u00a04), in which case we only included running-stop events where a reward delivery event occurred within the pre and post window (3 s). To determine the changes in Ca2+ activity due to animal locomotion and exclude potential transient responses from running-start and running-stop (Figure\u00a02F), only the activity in rest and running intervals with durations greater or equal to 9\u00a0s was considered. The response of the Ca2+ activity of each cell for each interval was calculated as the mean of the 1\u00a0s Ca2+ activity centered on the middle of the interval. The Ca2+ activity of INs of a recording session and the corresponding velocity of that session were first smoothed with a Gaussian kernel with a s.d. of 0.05 s. For each IN, the Ca2+ activity trace was then cross-correlated with the velocity with a limit that the minimum offset is \u22125\u00a0s (activity leading velocity) and the maximum is\u00a0+10\u00a0s (activity lagging velocity). Since the same IN was cross registered across multiple sessions, the cross correlation curve for that IN was averaged across those sessions for all the days recorded (Figures 2B, 3B, and S3A). The peak and the lag were calculated from the optima of the averaged cross correlation curve for each cell. Cells were classified as either positive velocity modulated (PVM) if the peak of the cross correlation curve is positive, or negatively velocity modulated (NVM) if the peak is negative, regardless of the lag time of the peak. For calculating the day-to-day stability of the grouping identity of an IN (Figure\u00a0S2D), the cross correlation curves of the sessions of each day were averaged, and the classification assigned based on the peak for that day. The classification of each IN was compared for one day to the next (consecutive pairs). The reward modulation of velocity is calculated as mean(velocitypre)rewarded-mean(velocitypre)unrewarded for pre-running-stop and mean(velocitypost)rewarded-mean(velocitypost)unrewarded for post-running stop (Figure\u00a0S3D). The velocity mean is using the mean of 3\u00a0s of velocity pre and post running-stop respectively. To remove the effect of the reward modulation of velocity and animal performance, the least-squares linear regression is calculated between the fraction of licks near the reward and the velocity modulation for both pre-running-stop and post-running-stop. The residual of the fraction of licks is calculated from the least-squares regression. To remove the effect of the reward modulation of velocity and VIP+ IN activity, the residual of the reward modulation of VIP+ INs\u2019 response against the velocity modulation is calculated similarly. The residuals are then correlated with each other. We use a simple linear model to directly link the Ca2+ activity as a linear function of input vectors (i.e., behavioral variables). Fitting the GLM coefficients entails finding the linear combination of behavioral covariates which optimally predicts the Ca2+ signal of a VIP+ IN. The following behavior variables were used: velocity, running-start, running-stop, licking, position, and water (reward). All the variables (except position) were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (\u03c3\u00a0= 0.125 s), and also shifted in time by\u00a0\u00b1 3\u00a0s (Figure\u00a05A) to account for temporal correlations between predictors and the Ca2+ signal. This window was chosen based on our analysis of velocity cross-correlations, which showed a lag of 1-3\u00a0s for most VIP+ INs (Figure\u00a02B). For the position signal, we divided the treadmill into 100 non-overlapping bins, which were represented in the model by 100 corresponding binary variables that were equal to one during times when the animal occupied that spatial bin and zero otherwise (Figure\u00a05A). These behavior variables were fitted to the Ca2+ activity of a VIP+ IN using ridge regression (), to manage potential collinearity of predictors and avoid overfitting. For cross-validation, the Ca2+ activity was first divided into six 100\u00a0s blocks. Each block was further divided into 10\u00a0s intervals. We implemented a 10-fold cross-validation procedure, where we trained the model on nine of ten 10\u00a0s intervals (of all six 100\u00a0s blocks simultaneously), and then tested on the held-out intervals (Figure\u00a05A). The intervals used for testing were then rotated in subsequent folds. We evaluated the model performance and comparisons on each cross-validation fold separately and combined these results to produce final summary statistics on model performance for each cell of each session. The regularization penalty was optimized separately through cross-validation on the training set, before fitting the final model on the full training set and evaluating prediction quality on the test set. To assess fit quality, we calculated the correlation coefficient and the coefficient of determination (r2) between the model\u2019s predicted Ca2+ activity and the actual Ca2+ activity. The covariates that we considered in the model can be correlated, which could produce redundancies in the model. Therefore, to estimate the specific contribution of each category of behavior variables, we also trained a reduced model which contained all variable groups except the category of interest. We then calculated the (base-2) log-likelihood ratio between the full model and the reduced model, normalized by the number of time samples, to estimate the information gained (in bits/sample) for predicting VIP+ IN activity by including the missing variable group. Importantly this measure was also estimated only from the held-out test data in the cross-validation procedure (). To measure the effect of the optogenetics laser on the animal\u2019s motivation to seek reward (Figure\u00a06A), we measured the change in the average velocity and rate of licking before and after the laser turned on. Therefore, we elected to examine how much the licking and velocity changes as we turn on the laser (Figure\u00a0S5B). We performed this comparison only in the first session where the learning performance is comparable and only the laser activation events where there was no reward delivered, to avoid any learning performance related confounds. We took the average of the licking and velocity in a 5\u00a0s pre and 5\u00a0s post window of each event and subtracted the pre from the post to calculate the magnitude of the change for that event. The magnitude of change of the events are averaged by mouse. Detailed methods for determining statistically significant place cells and their place fields, and the enrichment of the place fields around the reward zone are described in (, ). Briefly, for each pyramidal cell, Ca2+ transients whose onsets occurred during running bouts of at least 1\u00a0s in duration were used to calculate the spatial information () of that cell. Transients were then randomly reassigned to different times during the running epochs and the spatial information as recalculated. This random reassignment was done for 1000 iterations to create a null distribution for spatial information, and the cell was considered to be a place cell if its spatial information was above the 95 percentile of the null distribution. The place field of a place cell was calculated from its transient rate map over 100 spatial bins that evenly divide the belt. The rate map was the number of transients in a given spatial bin normalized by the animal\u2019s occupancy in that spatial bin, which was then smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (\u03c3\u00a0= 3 spatial bins). To detect individual place fields, each local maximum of the smoothed rate map was fitted with a Gaussian curve centered at that location. For each smoothed rate map, the place fields where the associated Gaussian was smaller than 50% of the largest Gaussian (by measuring the total area under the curve) were discarded. The remaining Gaussians were considered place fields, and the most active place field (the largest Gaussian by area under the curve) of each cell was used for the enrichment analysis in Figure\u00a06F. For analyzing spatial tuning of VIP+ INs in Figure\u00a0S2G, the \u0394F/F was used to calculate the spatial information of each cell. The \u0394F/F is then circularly randomly shifted in time for 1000 iterations to create a null distribution for spatial information. A cell is considered to have significant spatial information if it is greater than 95% of the null distribution. For the enrichment analysis (Figure\u00a06F), we calculated the relative spatial location to the reward of the most active place field for each CA1PC place cell. If CA1PC place cells uniformly sampled the positions on the belt, then the expected fraction of place cells would be the same as the fraction of the belt measured, e.g., 15% of the cells in 15% of the lap near the reward position. If the place cell population preferentially represented positions near the reward, then the fraction of cells in the 15% of the belt near the reward position would be higher than 15%. For the analysis in Figure\u00a06F, a one-sample t test was used to determine if the fraction of cells in each mouse in the 15% of the belt near the reward position was significantly higher than expected. The change between the fractions of cells near the reward position before and after learning was also calculated per mouse, and a one-sample t test was used to determine if the change was significantly different from zero. For all standard statistical tests (detailed in figure legends), the \u03b1 was chosen to be 0.05 for statistical significance. To correct for multiple comparisons, the \u03b1 was divided by the number of tests according to the Bonferroni procedure. Throughout the figures, p\u00a0values are denoted by \u2217 (p\u00a0< 0.05), \u2217\u2217 (p\u00a0< 0.01), and \u2217\u2217\u2217 (p\u00a0< 0.001). Bootstrap statistical tests are detailed below. For each cell, we pooled together the responses to the resting intervals and the running intervals (see Running modulation calculation above) into the resting pool and the running pool respectively. The two pools were sampled with replacement for 3000 iterations. For each iteration, the magnitude of the running modulation was calculated as the mean response of the sample from the resting pool subtracted from mean response of the sample from the running pool (mean \u0394F/Frunning - mean \u0394F/Frest). The 3000 running modulation magnitudes are then used to construct a two-tailed 99% confidence interval (CI). A cell was considered to have a significant positive running modulation if CI is greater than 0, negative modulation if CI is less than 0, and no modulation if the CI contains 0. To calculate whether a cell reliably changed its activity for an event type (Figures 2C\u20132E, 3C, and 3D), the response magnitudes of the Ca2+ traces (see Responses to behavior events above) for that event type for that cell were pooled together, and then the pool was sampled with replacement for 3000 iterations. For each iteration, the mean response magnitude was calculated. The 3000 mean response magnitudes were then used to construct a two-tailed 99% confidence interval (CI). The cell was determined to have a significantly negative response if the CI was less than 0, a significantly positive response if the CI was greater than 0, and a non-significant response if the CI contained 0. For the analysis in Figure\u00a04, a two-sample bootstrap test was used to calculate whether a VIP+ IN\u2019s response to running-stop events was significantly modulated by reward presentation. For each VIP+ IN, the response of the cell to each of the running-stop event was calculated as in the Responses to behavior events section above. Each event as further classified as rewarded and unrewarded, by the criterion that reward was presented in the 3\u00a0s window pre and post the running stop event. The events of the two classifications were then pooled separately into rewarded and unrewarded pools. The two pools were sampled with replacement for 3000 iterations. For each iteration, the magnitude of the reward modulation was calculated as the mean response of the sample from the unrewarded pool subtracted from mean response of the sample from the rewarded pool (mean responserewarded - mean responseunrewarded). The 3000 reward modulation magnitudes are then used to construct a two-tailed 99% confidence interval (CI). A cell was considered to have a significantly positive reward modulation if CI is greater than 0, a significantly negative modulation if CI is less than 0, and not significant if CI contains 0. For each metric measured, e.g., the predictive information gained from reward variables (Figure\u00a05C), the mean of the metric of the cells were averaged for each session. For correlations of the PVM and NVM groups, only cells in the respective groups were included. The mean of the metric for the sessions were then correlated with the behavior performance (fraction of licks near the reward) for that session. The 99% bootstrap confidence interval of the regression was calculated by resampling the sessions with replacement, and the regression was calculated for each resampling iteration. This is repeated for 3000 iterations. For the analysis in Figure\u00a0S1D, to test whether the fraction of VIP+ INs in each group (e.g., positive velocity modulated, PVM) is significantly different between a category of VIP+ INs (identified by post hoc neurochemical identification, e.g., CCK+) and all of the recorded VIP+ INs, we produced a null distribution from the all of the VIP+ INs. For each iteration, we randomly drew (with replacement) a sample of cells from all of the VIP+ INs, with the size of the drawn sample being equal to the size of the category we are comparing. This was repeated for 10,000 iterations, and the two-tailed 99% confidence interval was constructed for the number of cells in each group (e.g., PVM) in the null distribution. The fraction of a group (e.g., PVM) of VIP+ INs in a category (e.g., CCK+) was considered significantly different from the same group (e.g., PVM) from all of the VIP+ INs if the number of cells in that category was outside of the 99% confidence interval of the null distribution. Data analysis and figures were done using custom made software in Python 2.7.15\u2122 (https://www.python.org/). Data were analyzed statistically using GraphPad Prism 8.0.0. To compare level of enrichment among different groups (learning stage x condition), fractions of place cells were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by paired t test (two-tailed) with Bonferroni\u2019s correction whenever statistical significance was observed. The same procedure was followed to compare mean firing rates among groups (position in the track x condition), but here unpaired t test was used for post hoc comparisons. see STAR Methods.

The ER-shaping protein P180, present in axonal ER tubules, controls axon specification by regulating local MT remodeling. We propose a model in which feedback-driven regulation between the ER and MTs instructs neuronal polarity. Neuronal function relies on the proper formation and maintenance of two highly asymmetric structures, the somatodendritic and axonal domains, which contain different compositions of proteins and organelles. During neuronal development, axon formation\u00a0is the initial step in establishing neuronal polarity, followed by the development of dendrites and polarized cargo sorting\u00a0into neuronal components. Local rearrangement of the cytoskeleton is the major determinant in breaking symmetry, in which reorganization of a stable and uniform pool of parallel microtubule (MT) bundles is required for axon formation and maintenance of neuronal polarity (). Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) have been proposed to be major players in regulating MT remodeling in the axon (). Cumulating evidence indicates that specific membrane proteins, resident in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), have the ability to directly bind MTs and regulate their organization and stability (). In addition, several mutations in ER-resident proteins have been reported to cause the neurological disorder spastic paraplegia, characterized by MT disorganization and severe axonal degeneration (, ), highlighting the relevance of axonal ER organization in neuronal function. However, little is known about the interplay between MTs and the ER in neurons. The ER is one of the largest organelles in mammalian cells and, like the MT cytoskeleton, forms an extensive network filling the entire cell. The ER is organized into two distinct structural and functional interconnected domains determined by the shape of their membranes: ER cisternae and ER tubules. In unpolarized cells, the ER distributes as perinuclear ER cisternae and peripheral ER tubules that interact with each other, forming tubular junctions or more complex dense ER tubular matrices (, ). In mature neurons, the ER distributes along the entire axon as mainly a tubular organization (). Specific ER-resident transmembrane proteins\u00a0control the shape of the ER. For instance, ER-shaping proteins such as CLIMP63, P180 (also known as ribosome binding protein 1 homolog 180-kDa [RRBP1]), and kinectin (KTN1) induce a flattened structure organization of ER cisternae (), whereas proteins such as reticulons (RTNs) and DP1 (also known as REEP5) promote high curvature of ER membranes to form ER tubules (). Although ER membranes in\u00a0vitro can form a reticular network without MTs (), it is generally believed that the interaction between the ER and MTs regulates the shape of the ER. For instance, nocodazole-induced MT depolymerization leads to the retraction of peripheral ER tubules and their interconversion to perinuclear ER cisternae (). The MT plus-end motor KIF5 as well as the MT end-binding\u00a0protein 1 (EB1) regulate ER tubule localization at the cell periphery, whereas the MT minus-end motor dynein transports ER tubules backward to the perinuclear area (, , ). Several ER transmembrane proteins, such as CLIMP63, P180, REEP1, and Sec61\u03b2, have been shown to directly interact with MTs (, , , ). Although the functional relevance of this interactions is not fully understood, MTs may play a role in locally immobilizing the ER to drive efficient protein synthesis\u00a0(, , ). In addition, some of these factors (e.g., P180, Sec61\u03b2, and REEP1) have also been shown to control MT organization (, , ). However, the role of MT-ER interactions in developing neurons is an outstanding question. Here we found that ER tubules localize to the axon at very early stages of neuronal development. The localization of the axonal ER depends on the MT plus-end motor KIF5 and ER tubule-shaping proteins. We also show that the crosstalk between the ER and axonal MTs is decisive for neuronal polarity. Disrupting the MT cytoskeleton alters ER tubule organization, and alterations in the ER disrupt proper MT organization and axon initiation. In unpolarized neurons, recruitment of ER tubules into one neurite initiates axon formation, whereas ER retention in the perinuclear\u00a0area or disruption of ER tubules prevents neuronal polarization. Finally, we demonstrated that ER tubules containing the ER-shaping protein P180 control axon formation by inducing MT stabilization. Our data indicate that the interplay between the ER and MTs is critical for axonal specification and neuronal polarity. To determine how the ER is organized in neurons, we first analyzed the distribution of various endogenous and overexpressed ER-resident proteins in primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons at day in\u00a0vitro 7 (DIV7). Immunofluorescent staining for endogenous RTN4 (a protein enriched in ER tubules) localized to the somatodendritic and axonal domains but was slightly more abundant in the distal region of the axon (Figure\u00a01A). In contrast, staining for endogenous KDEL (a sequence abundant in some ER cisterna-resident proteins) was most concentrated in the soma, present in dendrites, but excluded from the axon (Figure\u00a01A). Next, we analyzed the distribution of low expression levels of several fluorescently tagged ER-resident proteins, which are more abundant in ER tubules (RTN4A, DP1, and ATL1) and ER cisternae (CLIMP63 and KTN1) or present in both ER compartments (Sec61\u03b2) in polarized neurons. Sec61\u03b2, RTN4A, DP1, and ATL1 were all distributed in dendrites and the axon (Figure\u00a01B). However, CLIMP63 and KTN1 were excluded from the axon (Figure\u00a01B). Quantification of the polarity index (PI; [intensity dendrite \u2212 intensity axon] / [intensity dendrite\u00a0+ intensity axon]) of these endogenous and overexpressed ER proteins confirmed the unpolarized distribution of ER tubule proteins (PI, \u22120.2 to 0) and the somatodendritic distribution of ER cisterna proteins (PI, 0.6 to 0.7) in fully polarized neurons at DIV7 (Figure\u00a01C). The slightly more abundant Sec61\u03b2 in dendrites (PI,\u00a0\u223c0.2) was consistent with the presence of both ER tubules and ER cisternae in dendrites (Figures 1B and 1C). To determine whether ER tubules require complete neuronal polarization to access the axon, we studied the distribution of endogenous RTN4 in neurons in early stages of development. DIV1 and DIV4 hippocampal neurons showed axonal distribution of RTN4, as evidenced by its co-distribution with the axonal marker Tau at DIV1 (Figure\u00a01D) and by its presence in axons negative for the somatodendritic marker MAP2 at DIV4 (Figure\u00a01E). Interestingly, quantification of the polarity index for endogenous RTN4 revealed that ER tubules were preferentially targeted to the axon before neurons reached a fully polarized organization (PI: \u223c-0.6 on DIV1, \u223c-0.5 on DIV4, and \u223c-0.2 on DIV7; Figure\u00a01F). In contrast, ER cisternae containing GFP-KTN1 were excluded from the axon in all of these stages (Figures 1G\u20131I). Together, these results show that the different domains of the ER, tubules and cisternae, have a distinct distribution in developing neurons. The MT-driven motor KIF5 and dynein as well as the MT end-binding protein 1 (EB1) have been shown to transport ER tubules between the perinuclear area and the cell periphery in non-neuronal cells (, , ). Here we examined whether these mechanisms also contribute to the axonal distribution of the ER. To address this question, we transfected neurons with plasmids containing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences targeting KIF5 (isoforms A, B, and C), the subunit P150 of the dynein complex, and EB (isoforms 1 and 3) proteins and analyzed the distribution of RTN4A-GFP in DIV7 neurons. Knockdown of KIF5 showed reduced axonal distribution of ER tubules and more abundance of them in the somatodendritic domain (PI, \u223c0.7; Figures 2A and 2B). In contrast, knockdown of P150 caused accumulation of ER tubules in the distal axon (PI, \u223c\u22120.5; Figures 2A and 2B), whereas shRNAs targeting EBs\u00a0reduced only dendritic ER tubule distribution (Figures 2A and 2B). shRNA directed to KIF1A, another MT plus-end-directed motor, did not affect ER tubule distribution (Figure\u00a02B). These results indicate that KIF5 and dynein are the main MT-driven proteins responsible for the antero- and retrograde transport\u00a0of ER\u00a0tubules in the axon, respectively. To determine whether ER cisternae are removed by the axon by active dynein-mediated transport, we knocked down P150 and compared the accumulation of ER tubule, ER cisterna, and general ER markers in the axon tips respective to their controls. RTN4 and Sec61\u03b2 showed an \u223c6- and \u223c3.5-fold increase, respectively, whereas CLIMP63 was not detected in axon tips (Figure\u00a0S1A). This result indicates that only ER tubules can access the axon and that ER cisternae are excluded from the axon more than actively retrograde-transported back to the soma. Next, we investigated whether the balance between ER tubules and ER cisternae could also contribute to the abundance of ERs in the axon. We first analyzed the distribution of the general ER-resident marker GFP-Sec61\u03b2 in neurons expressing low and high levels of the ER cisterna-shaping protein CLIMP63. RFP-CLIMP63 was mainly distributed in the somatodendritic\u00a0domain and excluded from the axon in both low- and high-expressing\u00a0neurons (PI, \u223c0.7 and \u223c0.9, respectively; Figures 2C\u20132E). However, the axonal distribution of GFP-Sec61\u03b2 was disrupted in neurons expressing high levels of CLIMP63, as evidenced\u00a0by its dramatic shift to a restrictive somatodendritic distribution (PI, \u223c0.2 to \u223c0.8), which can be explained by a reduction of axonal ER tubules and an expansion of ER cisternae along the dendrites but not the axon (Figures 2C\u20132E). To study whether ER tubule-shaping proteins also affect the abundance of ERs in the axon, we first designed and confirmed the efficiency of shRNAs targeting RTNs 1\u20134 and DP1 in neurons nucleofected on DIV0 and analyzed on DIV4 by mass spectrometry (Figure\u00a0S3). Then we transfected different combinations of shRNAs for RTNs and DP1 and analyzed the distribution of GFP-Sec61\u03b2 in DIV7 neurons. Knocking down all four RTN isoforms as well as only RTN4 (the most abundant RTN isoform in neurons; Figure\u00a0S3C) caused a shift in Sec61\u03b2 from almost unpolarized to a mainly somatodendritic distribution (PI, \u223c0.2 control to \u223c0.7 shRNAs; Figures 2F and 2G). Similar results were obtained for DP1 knockdown (PI, \u223c0.7), and a more dramatic shift in Sec61\u03b2 distribution was observed in neurons knocked down for both RTN4 and DP1 (PI, \u223c0.8; Figures 2F and 2G). In contrast, knockdown of the ER cisterna-shaping protein CLIMP63 or CLIMP63 plus KTN1 increased the abundance of Sec61\u03b2 in the axon (PI, \u223c\u22120.4 and \u223c\u22120.5, respectively) (Figure\u00a0S1B). To further analyze the dynamics of the axonal ER, we performed-live cell imaging and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of GFP-Sec61\u03b2 in the axons of DIV7 neurons. Anterograde and retrograde movement of ER tubules was observed after photobleaching in control neurons, with \u223c85% recovery of the mean fluorescence intensity within 5\u00a0min (Figures 2H and 2I; Video S1). However, axons from neurons knocked down for KIF5 as well as for RTN4 plus DP1 showed reduced Sec61\u03b2 mean intensity recovery compared with control neurons (Figure\u00a02I). Similar ER movement in control neurons stained with the ER-BODIPY-red tracker was observed (Figure\u00a0S2C). By using the classical ER membrane marker DiOC6, we also confirmed that the reduction of Sec61\u03b2 in axons from neurons knocked down for KIF5 or RTN4 plus DP1 or high expression of CLIMP63 is due to a reduction of the ER tubule membrane itself\u00a0(Figures S2A and S2B). In addition, we evaluated ER distribution in the presence of a KIF5A-rigor mutant that can bind MTs but not walk or dissociate from them (). High expression of the GFP-KIF5A-rigor mutant prevented access of mCh-RTN4A to the axon compared with control neurons in which ER tubules entering the axon were clearly observed after photobleaching (Figures 2J and 2K; Video S2). Similarly, KIF5A-rigor also prevented entrance of the ER-BODIPY-red tracker and mCh-Sec61\u03b2 to the axon (Figure\u00a0S2D). Together, these results indicate that MT-based transport and the shape of the ER control the distribution\u00a0of the ER in the axon. We found that KIF5A-rigor was not only altering the KIF5-based transport of ER tubules to the axon but also blocking the ER-MT interaction and affecting ER shape. KIF5A-rigor caused interconversion of ER tubules to ER cisternae, which were clearly excluded from MT bundles occupied by KIF5A-rigor (Figure\u00a02L; Figure\u00a0S2E; Video S2). Because KIF5A-rigor binds preferentially to stable acetylated MTs in neurons (), we analyzed the co-distribution of the ER and acetylated MTs at different stages of development. A preferential co-distribution of endogenous RTN4 and acetylated \u03b1-tubulin along the axon was observed in DIV1 and DIV4 neurons (Figures 3A and 3B). In the soma of neurons expressing high levels of RTN4A-GFP, we also visualized individual ER tubules colocalizing with stable acetylated MT bundles (Figure\u00a03C). By using the MT-destabilizing and -stabilizing drugs nocodazole and Taxol, respectively, we then studied how the stability of MTs contributes to ER distribution\u00a0and organization. DIV4 neurons exposed to 10\u00a0\u03bcM nocodazole for 4\u00a0h caused a reduction in the density of acetylated MTs along the medium and distal axon together with a drastic reduction in RTN4A-GFP in the axon and its accumulation, mainly in the soma (Figures 3D and 3E). Conversely, 20\u00a0nM Taxol produced an increase in RTN4A-GFP along the dendrites\u00a0after 4\u00a0h of treatment (Figures 3D and 3E). Interestingly, nocodazole also caused the interconversion of ER tubules to ER cisternae in the soma (Figure\u00a03F). The reduction of axonal ER tubules\u00a0by nocodazole was also observed with GFP-Sec61\u03b2 and DiOC6 markers (Figure\u00a0S4A). Then we analyzed the dynamics of ER redistribution in the presence of nocodazole and Taxol. Nocodazole induces time-dependent depolymerization of MTs, affecting first-dynamics MTs and later stable MTs (). Nocodazole induced rapid redistribution and accumulation of RTN4A-GFP to the dendritic tips after 5\u201315\u00a0min to then start moving back to the soma after 30\u2013120\u00a0min (Figures 3G and 3H; Video S3). Axonal RTN4A-GFP as well as GFP-Sec61\u03b2 were still present in the imaged proximal axon after 1\u20132\u00a0h of treatment but drastically redistributed to the soma after 2\u20134\u00a0h (Figure\u00a03G; Figure\u00a0S4B; Video S3). On the other hand, Taxol did not affect the distribution of ER\u00a0tubules in the first 2\u00a0h but started to slightly increase the abundance of them in the soma and dendrites after 3\u20134\u00a0h (Figure\u00a03I; Video S3). These results indicate that MT stability contributes to ER distribution and organization in neurons. Conversely, we wondered whether ER tubules could have a role in MT organization and dynamics. To study this, we developed two strategies to manipulate ER tubule positioning. We induced acute and controlled depletion of ER tubules in the axon and sustained retention of ER tubules in the somatodendritic domain by\u00a0using the FKBP-FRB rapalog-induced system and the Streptavidin-SBP (Streptavidin binding protein) heterodimerization system, respectively (, ). More specifically, we triggered binding of the dynein motor complex to ER tubules by fusing an FRB sequence to a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged BicD2 (a dynein cargo adaptor) and an FKBP sequence to GFP- or mCh-tagged RTN4A (Figure\u00a04A). Only the addition of rapalog to neurons transfected with the above constructs caused removal of most ER tubules containing RTN4A in the axon after 1\u00a0h of treatment compared with neurons treated with just vehicle (Figure\u00a04A). Similarly, adding a Streptavidin sequence to KIFC1 (another minus end-driven motor) and an SBP to RTN4A caused sustained retention of ER tubules in the somatodendritic domain and removal from the axon for several hours (24\u201348 h; Figure\u00a04B). Axonal depletion of membranes containing\u00a0RTN4A corresponded to ER tubules, as shown by the removal of other ER markers such as DiOC6, Sec61\u03b2, DP1, and ATL1 and endogenous RTN4 from the axons of transfected neurons treated with rapalog for 1\u00a0h (Figure\u00a04C; Figures S5A\u2013S5D). By using the FKBP-FRB rapalog-induced system, we first found that the MT-binding and bundle protein TRIM46 (enriched in the proximal axon) () was shifted to the soma and decorated a track of MTs running from the perinuclear area (where ER tubules were mostly re-distributed) to the very proximal axon (Figure\u00a04D). Similar results were obtained with the Streptavidin-SBP system (Figure\u00a04D). In addition, live-cell imaging of RFP-TRIM46 in neurons expressing GFP-FKBP-RTN4A plus HA-BicD-FRB indicated that the shift of TRIM46 to the soma started a few minutes after rapalog incubation, whereas TRIM46 was still immobile in the proximal axon after\u00a01\u00a0h of recording in untreated neurons (Figure\u00a04E; Video S4A). Then we analyzed the distribution of endogenous EB1 and dynamics of GFP-MT+TIP, both markers for dynamic MTs, in neurons expressing the rapalog system. Retraction of ER tubules\u00a0to the perinuclear area caused a drastic increase in the number of the characteristic comets marking MT plus-end tips in regions of the soma that were lacking ER tubules, indicating an increase in MT instability (Figures 4F and 4G; Figure\u00a0S5E; Video S5A). We also studied the distribution of CAMPSAP2, a\u00a0non-centrosomal MT minus end-stabilizing protein that typically decorates MT stretches in the soma and proximal segments\u00a0of dendrites and axons (). ER tubule retraction caused a drastic shift of CAMSAP2 with stretches emanating from the perinuclear area (Figures 4H and 4I; Video S5B). To determine whether removal of ER tubules from the axon altered MT stability in the axon, we analyzed the dynamics of a photo-activatable GFP-\u03b1-tubulin (PA-Tub) construct. Photoactivated patches of PA-Tub in the axon of control neurons display a remarkable stable pool of MTs that last for several hours. However, ER tubule removal from the axon caused a retrograde flow of photoactivated tubulin patches in the axon, indicating that MTs became more dynamic after 1\u00a0h of rapalog treatment (Figure\u00a04J; Video S6). Because shRNAs targeting RTN4 and DP1 also caused a reduction in axonal ER (Figures 2F and 2G), we wondered how PA-Tub behaves in axons from neurons knocked down for these proteins. PA-Tub was slightly displaced in the first hour and became substantially more dynamic after 4\u00a0h of recording in neurons expressing shRNAs for RTN4 plus DP1 compared with control neurons (Figure\u00a04K). Because the role of MTs in the recruitment of axon initial segment (AIS) protein complex to the plasma membrane in the proximal axon (), we also analyzed the distribution and dynamics of AIS proteins in neurons depleted from axonal ER tubules. Ankyrin-G (AnkG), the master AIS organizer, as well as the interacting proteins NF, NaV, and \u03b2IV-Spectrin, were all disassembled from the proximal axon (Figure\u00a0S6; Video S4B). Together, these results reveal a key role for ER tubules in the organization and dynamics of axonal MTs and in the assembly of the AIS. MT stabilization by Taxol induces multiple axons in already polarized neurons (). We analyzed how disruption of ER tubule formation affects the ability of Taxol to induce multiple axons in neurons at DIV7. Control-transfected neurons treated with Taxol for 72\u00a0h caused an \u223c4-fold increase in the number of axons positive for TRIM46 and AnkG markers (Figures 5A and 5B). In contrast, neurons knocked down for RTN4 and DP1 and treated with Taxol did not exhibit multiple axons and were similar to neurons treated with just vehicle (Figures 5A and 5B). Increased MT stability as well as TRIM46 recruitment to a single neurite have been observed even before axon formation in neurons in the transition between stages 2 and 3 (, ). We analyzed the distribution of ER tubules in DIV1 neurons in which a mixed population of unpolarized\u00a0neurons (stage 2) and axon-specified neurons positive for Tau (stage 3) can be observed. Interestingly, we found a population of unpolarized neurons in the transition of stage 2\u20133 that showed preferential distribution of endogenous RTN4 in one minor neurite that coincided with slightly more stable acetylated, detyrosinated MTs and that was also positive for TRIM46 (Figures 5C\u20135E). Moreover, we analyzed the dynamics of recruitment of RTN4A-GFP and RFP-TRIM46 in neurons during axon specification. Increased and persistent RTN4A transport to a minor\u00a0neurite and recruitment of TRIM46 to the same neurite preceded\u00a0axon specification (Figure\u00a05F; Video S7A). TRIM46 was retained in the proximal part of the axon, but RTN4A continued to slide along the entire axon during axon elongation (Figure\u00a05G; Video S7B). To corroborate these results, we also treated neurons at stage 3 with Taxol to induce multiple axons and evaluate the recruitment of RTN4A-GFP and RFP-TRIM46 to the new axons in formation by live-cell imaging. Before adding Taxol to neurons, RTN4A and TRIM46 were mostly distributed in the formed axon, but after hours of treatment, both proteins were also targeted to other neurites prior to their elongation and specification of the new axons (Figure\u00a05H; Video S7C). Importantly, we analyzed whether the recruitment of ER tubules\u00a0to a minor neurite was required for the specification of the axon. We utilized the Streptavidin-SBP system (Figure\u00a04B) to produce immediate and sustained retention of ER tubules\u00a0at the soma. Neurons were nucleofected in suspension prior plating on DIV0, and the percentages of neurons in stages 2 and 3 were quantified at DIV2 based on positive staining for endogenous TRIM46 and Tau and axon length (Figure\u00a05I). ER tubule retention caused a reduction of neurons in stage 3, as determined by an increased population of neurons negative for TRIM46 and Tau staining as well as an increased number of neurons with only short minor neurites (Figure\u00a05I; Figure\u00a0S7A). Disruption of ER tubule formation by expressing shRNAs for RTN4 and DP1 produced similar results (Figure\u00a05I; Figure\u00a0S7B). We also examined whether ER tubules play a role during neuron polarization and migration in situ. Mouse brains were electroporated ex\u00a0vivo at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) with control\u00a0and RTN4 plus DP1 shRNAs together with GFP to visualize neuronal morphology. After 4\u00a0days, control neurons efficiently migrated to the upper layers of the cortical plate and developed a typical bipolar morphology with a trailing edge (future axon) and leading process (future apical dendrite). In contrast, ER tubule-depleted neurons failed to migrate properly and accumulated in the ventricular and subventricular zones (Figures S7D and S7E). Thus, the distribution of ER tubules in\u00a0neurites is required for the specification of the axon and neuron migration. We next investigated the mechanism by which ER tubules control ER-MT co-stabilization and neuronal polarity. Among all of the ER-shaping proteins described, only CLIMP63, P180, and REEP1 have been shown to directly interact with and bundle MTs in non-neuronal cells (, , ). In neurons, CLIMP63 distributed in the somatodendritic domain, REEP1 has been shown previously to distribute mainly in axonal branches and axonal tips (), and P180 localization has not yet been studied. Mass spectrometry analysis indicated that P180 was expressed in our primary culture of neurons (Figure\u00a0S3C). Therefore, we analyzed and compared the distribution of P180 in COS-7 cells and cultured neurons. In COS-7 cells, GFP-tagged P180 was distributed in perinuclear ER cisternae (Figures 6A and 6I), as reported previously (). Interestingly, in neurons, the distribution was slightly different. GFP-P180 was localized in ER cisternae at the soma but also present in ER tubule-like structures distributed mainly in the axon and\u00a0excluded from dendrites (PI, \u223c\u22120.9; Figures 6B\u20136D). P180 was particularly abundant in the more proximal segment of the axon (Figure\u00a06E). Knockdown of the ER tubule-shaping proteins RTN4 and DP1 as well as overexpression of CLIMP63 caused exclusion of GFP-P180 from the axon and its main distribution in the soma as ER cisternae, which confirmed the nature of these axonal ER membranes containing P180 as ER tubules (Figures 6F and 6G). P180 contains a short luminal and single-transmembrane domain followed by a long cytosolic tail featuring the presence of a basic decapeptide repeat and an acidic coiled-coil (CC) domain. To identify the domains responsible for the distribution of P180 within the ER, we generated various P180 deletion constructs (Figure\u00a06H) and analyzed their distribution in COS-7 cells and in neurons. P180-\u0394cytosolic tail was distributed along all the ER, including ER tubules and ER cisternae in both types of cells, suggesting that the cytosolic tail is required for the preferential distribution of P180 in specific ER domains (Figure\u00a06I). COS-7 cells and neurons expressing P180-\u0394repeats or P180-\u0394CC showed an ER cisterna and ER tubule distribution, respectively (Figures 6J and 6K). We also evaluated how the two domains of P180 contribute to the organization of the ER. Overexpression of P180-\u0394repeats caused an expansion of ER cisternae and the disappearance of peripheral ER tubules in COS-7 cells, as evidenced by mCh-Sec61\u03b2 distribution with respect to control cells expressing low levels of P180-full length (FL) (Figure\u00a06J). Similar results were observed in neurons in which P180-\u0394repeats and mCh-Sec61\u03b2 were redistributed as ER cisternae in the somatodendritic domain (Figure\u00a06K). On the other hand, expression of P180-\u0394CC induced its co-distribution with mCh-Sec61\u03b2 in highly\u00a0curved ER structures in COS-7 cells, which were more abundant in the axon than in the somatodendritic domain of neurons\u00a0(Figures 6J and 6K). These results indicate that two distinct regions of the cytosolic tail of P180 contribute to its distribution within the ER and confer to P180 the ability to regulate ER organization. Next, we analyzed how P180 contributes to MT stabilization. COS-7 cells expressing P180-\u0394CC showed much higher levels of acetylated and bundled MTs than untransfected adjacent cells, which were aligned with the curved ER (Figures 7A\u20137C). The stabilization of MTs induced by P180-\u0394CC was not observed by P180-\u0394repeats and only slightly increased by P180-FL expression (Figure\u00a07A). Accordingly, staining for EB1 showed a decrease in the number of comets in cells expressing P180-\u0394CC, indicating less dynamics MTs (Figures 7D and 7E). To determine the contribution of P180 to axonal MT stability, we analyzed the levels of acetylated \u03b1-tubulin in the axon. Neurons transfected with an shRNA targeting P180 showed a decrease in acetylated MTs compared with control neurons (Figure\u00a07F). Moreover, analysis of photoactivated patches of PA-Tub in the axon of neurons knocked down for P180 showed more dynamic\u00a0MTs compared with the static distribution of stable MTs 4\u00a0h after photoactivation (Figure\u00a07G). To investigate the link between MT stabilization mediated by P180 and axon specification, we used the Taxol treatment assay to induce multiple axons. P180 knockdown prevented Taxol-induced formation of multiple axons (Figure\u00a07H). In contrast, we found that untreated neurons expressing just high levels of P180\u0394CC induced the formation of multiple axons positive for TRIM46, which showed co-distribution of P180\u0394CC with stabilized MTs (Figures 7I\u20137K). Finally, we analyzed the effect of P180 on axon specification. We nucleofected neurons in suspension with shRNA targeting P180 and stained for TRIM46 and Tau at DIV2. Knockdown of P180 decreased the percentage of neurons in stage 3 (Figure\u00a07L; Figure\u00a0S6C). Co-expression of a GFP-P180 shRNA-resistant construct was sufficient to rescue neuronal polarization (Figure\u00a07L; Figure\u00a0S7C). These results indicate\u00a0that P180-induced MT stabilization facilitates axon specification. Here we propose a feedback-driven model in which local interplay between the ER and MTs instructs neuronal polarity. MTs are required for the stabilization of ER tubules and their transport along the axon, and, concurrently, ER tubules are critically important for organizing axonal MTs. In unpolarized neurons, the formation of stable parallel MTs and the recruitment of ER tubules\u00a0is essential to initiate axon formation. Our data suggest that the ER-shaping protein P180 acts as a positive regulator between\u00a0the ER and MT cytoskeleton to control axon specification and neuronal polarity. ER membranes can form and maintain a stable reticular network by ER intrinsic mechanisms. A balance between ER cisterna- and ER tubule-shaping proteins as well as fusion between ER membranes regulates ER organization (, ). In this study, we found that the two different ER shapes, tubules and cisternae, are asymmetrically distributed in the axon and somatodendritic domain. Moreover, we found that overexpression of ER cisterna-shaping proteins as well knockdown of ER tubule shaping proteins caused a drastic reduction in axonal ER distribution. In the axon, long ER tubules interconnect with each other but do not show as much complexity as the reticular ER network observed in the somatodendritic domain (). The thin diameter of the axon could be physically obstructing the formation of a wider ER network. However, the precise mechanism responsible for the distinct localization of ER tubules and ER cisternae remains unclear. The AIS has been implicated in selective filtering of\u00a0axonal and somatodendritic organelles (). However,\u00a0in developing neurons, ER cisternae were found in the somatodendritic domain but excluded from the axon before AIS establishment. Alternatively, association of ER tubule proteins with stable MTs may induce their stabilization and selective axonal transport, leaving ER cisternae behind in the somatodendritic compartment. On the other hand, other MAPs may retain ER cisternae in the somatodendritic domain. The polarized segregation of the two ER shapes in neurons is consistent with the distribution and organization of the biosynthetic pathway, where the rough ER (conformed by mainly ER cisterna membrane shape) produces and delivers transmembrane and secretion\u00a0proteins to the Golgi complex, which is also located in the somatodendritic domain, to then sort these proteins into different set of vesicles for their polarized transport (, ). Identifying the mechanism by which ER cisternae are excluded from the axon will be an important\u00a0future research goal. ER tubules extend to the cell periphery by a tip attachment complex (TAC) mechanism in which ER tubules attach to growing plus ends of dynamic MTs through EBs (). Alternatively, sliding mechanisms have been reported, where ER tubules are transported along stable MTs (, ). In this study, we show that axonal ER tubules are transported by MT-based motors. We found that knockdown of KIF5 and dynein motors disrupted anterograde and retrograde ER tubule trafficking along the axon. The preferential association of KIF5 with stable axonal MTs may specify ER transport into the axon. Knockdown of EBs did not affect axonal ER but reduced ER in dendrites. It is possible that a sliding mechanism is required for axonal ER trafficking\u00a0and that a TAC-based mechanism contributes to dendritic\u00a0ER transport. Although ER-resident proteins involved in the sliding mechanism have not been identified, some studies suggest that the ER cisterna-shaping protein KTN1 could act as a receptor for KIF5 (, ). Because of its exclusion from the axon, it is unlikely that KTN1 facilitates the sliding of ER tubules along axonal MTs. However, the ER-shaping protein P180 contains a KTN1 homologous region that can also bind KIF5 (). We found P180 distributed in both ER cisternae in the soma and ER tubules in the axon. Besides a KIF5 binding site, P180 contains two MT\u00a0binding domains that are absent in KTN1 () and may help to stabilize ER tubules\u00a0for proper KIF5-mediated axonal ER trafficking. MT remodeling plays a critical role during neuronal polarization (). The presence of stable and parallel MT arrays () and the axonal distribution of ER tubules during the early steps of neuronal polarization\u00a0led us to hypothesize that the interplay between ER and MTs induces changes in the cellular shape required for axon formation. Indeed, we found that local recruitment of ER tubules\u00a0to a minor neurite preceded axon formation. On the other hand, axon outgrowth was inhibited by retention of ER tubules in the perinuclear area and disruption of ER tubules. Moreover, blocking ER tubule formation prevented the formation of multiple axons induced by Taxol. We propose a model in which the ER tubule-MT interplay drives neuronal polarity. This process starts with the formation of stable parallel MT arrays by specific axonal MAPs such as TRIM46. Concurrently, interaction between MTs and the newly formed ER tubule in one minor neurite may further stabilize this MT organization required for axon elongation. ER proteins that interact with MTs, such as P180, may act as crosslinkers between the ER and axonal MTs to co-stabilize and reinforce\u00a0the ER tubule-MT interaction. Our data showed that pulling ER tubules to the perinuclear area induced the relocation of stable axonal MT bundles. Moreover, pulling ER tubules to the perinuclear area, ER tubule disruption, as well as P180 knockdown all caused axonal MT instability. Other ER tubule proteins may be involved in additional MT remodeling processes during later stages of axon outgrowth. For instance, the interaction of REEP1, ATL1, and the MT-severing protein spastin has been suggested to contribute to MT dynamics at axonal branchpoints and growth cones (). The presence of ER tubules in the newly formed axon may provide a local source of lipid and/or control local calcium homeostasis. Both ER-related processes\u00a0have been shown to be required for axon outgrowth and guidance (, ). It will be important to investigate the precise role of ER tubules in axon formation and outgrowth in future studies. In summary, our data demonstrate that the interplay between the ER and MT cytoskeleton is critical for axonal specification and neuronal polarity. We found that the interaction between ER-shaping proteins and axonal MTs is required for maintaining proper axonal architecture. Alterations in ER function and MT organization have been described in several neurodegenerative diseases (, , ). For instance, mutations in ER-resident proteins such ATL1 (SPG3A), REEP1 (SPG31), and RTN2 (SPG12) and MT-remodeling factors such as spastin (SPG4) cause spastic paraplegia, a syndrome characterized by progressive weakness and spasticity (stiffness) mainly caused by motor-sensory axon degeneration (), and loss of these hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) proteins lead to partial loss of the ER from distal axons as well as fewer but enlarged and occasionally discontinuous ER tubules in Drosophila larval peripheral nerve axons (). In addition, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked mutations in the ER protein VAPB have been shown to disrupt ER organization (), and RTN4A overexpression prevents axon degeneration in another ALS mutant mouse model (). Our current findings provide new molecular insights into how imbalance in ER-MT interactions could contribute to neurodegenerative diseases.

All experiments were approved by the DEC Dutch Animal Experiments Committee (Dier Experimenten Commissie), performed in line with institutional guidelines of University Utrecht, and conducted in agreement with Dutch law (Wet op de Dierproeven, 1996) and European regulations (Directive 2010/63/EU). Female pregnant Wistar rats were obtained from Janvier, and embryos (both genders) at E18 stage of development were used for primary cultures of hippocampal and cortical neuron. Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were obtained\u00a0from Janvier, and embryos (both genders) at E14.5 stage of development were used for ex-vivo electroporation and organotypic\u00a0brain slice cultures. Primary hippocampal and cortical neurons cultures were prepared from embryonic day 18 rat brains. Cells were plated on coverslips coated with poly-L-lysine (37.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) and laminin (1.25\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) at a density of 100,000/well or 50,000/well (12-well plates). Neurons were cultured in Neurobasal medium (NB) supplemented with 1% B27 (GIBCO), 0.5\u00a0mM glutamine (GIBCO), 15.6\u00a0\u03bcM glutamate (Sigma), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (GIBCO) and maintained in an incubator under controlled temperature and CO2 conditions (37\u00b0C, 5% CO2). In most experiments, hippocampal neurons were transfected with different plasmid constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Briefly, DNA (0.05-2\u00a0\u03bcg/well) was mixed with 1.2\u00a0\u03bcL of Lipofectamine 2000 in 200\u00a0\u03bcL Opti-MEM, incubated for 20\u00a0min at room temperature, and then added to the neurons in NB at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 1 h. Next, neurons were washed with NB and transferred to their original medium and maintained at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 until imaging of fixation. Alternatively, hippocampal (200,000 cells; 12 well plates) and cortical neurons (1,300,000 cells for Mass-Spectrometry experiments; 6-well plates) were nucleofected in suspension at DIV0 with different plasmid constructs using the Amaxa Rat Neuron Nucleofector kit (Lonza) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Embryonic mice brains were electroporated with 1.5\u03bcl DNA mixture containing a MARCKS-GFP vector plus shRNAs directed to RTN4 and DP1 or pSuper empty vector (control). DNA was dissolved in MQ with 0.05% FastGreen FCF Dye (Sigma). The mix was injected in the lateral ventricles of the embryonic brains using borosilicate glass micro-pipettes (World Precision Instruments) and a PLI-100A Picoliter Microinjector (Warner Instruments). Brain motor cortex were electroporated with platinum plated electrodes (Nepagene) using an ECM 830 Electro Square Porator (Harvard Apparatus) set to 3 unipolar pulses of 100ms at 30V with 100ms intervals.\u00a0Embryonic heads were then isolated and collected in ice-cold cHBSS, embedded in 3% SeaPlaque GTG Agarose (Lonza) in cHBSS and sectioned coronally into 300\u00a0\u03bcm thick slices using a VT1000\u00a0S Vibratome (Leica). Slices were collected on poly-L-lysine and laminin-coated culture membrane inserts (Falcon), placed on top of slice culture medium (% v/v Basal Eagle Medium, 26% v/v cHBSS, 20mM D-glucose, 1mM L-glutamine, 0.1\u00a0mg/mL penicillin/streptomycin) and cultured 4\u00a0days prior to fixation. African Green Monkey SV40-transformed kidney fibroblast (COS-7) cells from ATCC were cultured in DMEM/Ham\u2019s F10 (50%/50%) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Cell lines were not authenticated by authors after purchase. The cell lines were routinely checked for mycoplasma contamination using LT07-518 Mycoalert assay (Lonza). Cells were plated in 18mm glass coverslips and transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol.

For the Strep/SBP heterodimerization system, Strep-KIFC1-HA and GFP- or mCh-SBP-RTN4A were generated. The region encoding amino acids 126-673 of KIFC1 was PCR amplified from KIFC1 cDNA (Clone I.M.A.G.E: 40117894) and the Streptavidin sequence was PCR amplified from mCh-KIF5A-MD-Strep (). Both cDNAs were cloned into pmCherry-N1 between XhoI and SalI sites by GIBSON assembly. The mCherry sequence was removed and replaced by a 3x HA sequence, generated by oligos annealing and inserted between AgeI and BsrGI sites. A 3x(glycine-serine) linker was introduced between the Strep and KIFC1 sequences to allow freedom of movement between domains. The SBP sequence (DEKTTGWRGGHVVEGLAGELEQLRARLEHHPQGQREP), generated by oligo synthesis, was cloned into pEGFP(A206K)-C1 and pmCherry-N1 vectors, between XhoI and HindIII\u00a0sites, to obtain the GFP-SBP and mCh-SBP plasmids. Then, RTN4A was PCR amplified from RTN4A-GFP (; Addgene plasmid # 61807) and cloned into GFP-SBP or mCh-SBP plasmids between SalI and BamH1 sites. A 3x(glycine-serine) linker was introduced between SBP and RTN4A sequences. For the induced FRB/FKBP heterodimerization system, HA-BicD2-MD-FRB has been already described (). To generate GFP-FKBP-RTN4 and mCh-FKBP-RTN4A, a 2x FKBP sequence was PCR amplified from PEX3-mRFP-FKBP () and RTN4A was PCR amplified from RTN4A-GFP (; Addgene plasmid # 61807).

All P180 deletion constructs were PCR amplified from P180 cDNA (; Addgene #92150). P180\u0394cytosolic tail containing the luminal and transmembrane domain and the first 5 amino acids from the cytosolic tail followed by a 3x(glycine-serine) linker, were PCR amplified and cloned into pEGFP(A206K)-N1 vector between XhoI and BamH1 sites. The primers used to generate P180\u0394cytosolic tail plasmid are: 5\u2032-agcgctaccggactcagatctcgagcaccatggatatttacgacactc-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-caccatggtggcgaccggtggatccgggctaccgctgccgctacccatggagaaagtcgacac-3\u2032. P180\u0394CC containing all the luminal, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains (which lacks the coiled-coil region) followed by a 3x(glycine-serine) linker were PCR amplified and cloned into pEGFP(A206K)-N1 vector between XhoI and BamH1 sites. The primers used to generate the P180\u0394CC plasmid are: 5\u2032-agcgctaccggactcagatctcgagcaccatggatatttacgacactcaaac-3\u2032 and 5\u2032- caccatggtggcgaccggtggatccgggctaccgctgccgctaccagaagctgactctgtctttttac-3\u2032. P180\u0394repeats containing all the luminal, transmembrane, and cytosolic domain (lacking the decapeptide repeats region) were obtained by amplifying two\u00a0PCR fragments, which were cloned into pEGFP(A206K)-N1 vector between XhoI and BamH1 sites by GIBSON assembly. One\u00a03x(glycine-serine) linker was added between the two fragments and other between the coiled-coiled domain and GFP.

Other reagents used in this study were taxol (paclitaxel; Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# T7402), nocodazole (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# 1404), rapalog (Takara, Cat# 635057), NeutrAvidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#31000), Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Cat#1639722), DiOC6(3) (3,3\u2032-Dihexyloxacarbocyanine Iodide; Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Cat# D273), ER-Tracker Red (BODIPY TR Glibenclamide;\u00a0Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Cat# E34250); Mix-n-Stain CF640R (Biotium, Cat# 92245), and FastGreen FCF Dye (Sigma, Cat# F7252). Nocodazole was used at 10\u00a0\u03bcM for 1h (Figure\u00a03G) or 4h (Figures 3D, 3F, and 3H and Figure\u00a0S4), taxol was used at 20nM for 4h (Figures 3D and 3I) or 16h (Figure\u00a05H) or 72h for multiple axon formation experiments (Figures 5A and 7H). For induced FKBP/FRB heterodimerization assay, rapalog was used at 100\u00a0nM for 1h (Figures 4A and 4C\u20134J and Figures S5A\u2013S5E). For the Strep-SBP heterodimerization system, NeutrAvidin (0.3\u00a0mg/mL) was added just after transfection to prevent Strep-SBP dissociation by the presence of biotin in the neuronal medium (Figures 4B and 4D and 5I). DMSO (0.001%) and ethanol (0.1%) were used as vehicle control treatments. Untransfected, pSuper-transfected and shRNAs-transfected (RTNs; DP1) cortical neurons (DIV5) were washed 3 times with PBS and lysed with lysis buffer (8\u00a0M Urea, 50\u00a0mM triethylammonium bicarbonate, plus EDTA-free protease inhibitor Cocktail). 50ug of proteins from each condition were reduced (5\u00a0mM DTT, 55\u00b0C, 30\u00a0min), alkylated (10\u00a0mM Iodoacetamide, 30\u00a0min in the dark) and sequentially digested by LysC (Protein-enzyme ratio 1:50, 37\u00b0C, 4 h) and trypsin (Protein-enzyme ratio 1:50, 37\u00b0C, overnight). Resulting peptides were then desalted using C18 solid phase extraction cartridges (Waters) and subjected to stable isotope TMT-6plex labeling according to manufacturer\u2019s instruction (Thermo Scientific). For labeling the following scheme was used: untransfected\u00a0= TMT-126; pSuper\u00a0= TMT-127; shRNAs for RTNs\u00a0= TMT-128; shRNA for DP1\u00a0= TMT-131. Differentially labeled peptides were mixed in a 1:1:1:1 ratio based on LC-MS/MS base peak intensity of the separate channels, dried in a vacuum concentrator and reconstituted in 10% formic acid for subsequent fractionation. Peptides were fractionated using offline high pH (basic) reversed-phase chromatography prior to MS analysis. Samples collected after fractionation were analyzed on a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) coupled online to an Agilent UPLC 1290 system (Agilent Technologies). Peptides were loaded onto a trap column (Reprosil C18, 3\u00a0\u03bcm, 2\u00a0cm \u00d7 100\u00a0\u03bcm; Dr. Maisch) with solvent A (0.1% formic acid) and separated on an analytical column (Poroshell 120 EC C18, Agilent Technologies, 50\u00a0\u03bcm x 50\u00a0cm, 2.7\u00a0\u03bcm) using a 120\u00a0min linear gradient from 7%\u201330% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). For data analysis, raw files were processed using Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (version 1.4.1.14, Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Database search was performed using the Uniprot rat database and Mascot (version 2.5.1, Matrix Science, UK) as search engine. Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was set as a fixed modification. Oxidation of methionine and TMT-6plex of lysine residues and peptide N terminus, were set as variable modifications. Trypsin was set as cleavage specificity, allowing a maximum of 2 missed cleavages. Data filtering was performed using percolator, resulting in 1% false discovery rate (FDR). Additional filters were search engine rank 1 and mascot ion score > 20. Unique peptides or total peptides were used for quantification and the obtained ratios were normalized to the median. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD012264. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde plus 4% sucrose in PBS for 20\u00a0min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15\u00a0min, blocked with 0.2% porcine gelatin for 30\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C, and stained with primary antibodies for 30\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C, followed by secondary antibodies for 30\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C. Cells were washed 3 times for 5\u00a0min in PBS after incubation with primary and secondary antibodies. For EB1 and CAMSAP2 staining, neurons were fixed with methanol (100%) containing 1mM EGTA for 10\u00a0min at \u221220\u00b0C followed by 4% paraformaldehyde plus 4% sucrose for 5\u00a0min. All fluorescence images were obtained using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM700, Zeiss) equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63x NA 1.40 oil DIC, EC Plan-Neofluar 40x NA1.30 Oil DIC and a Plan-Apochromat\u00a020x NA 0.8 objectives. For fluorescence intensity comparison, settings were kept the same for all conditions. Organotypic\u00a0culture of brain slices were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and then permeabilized and blocked in 10% normal goat serum/0.2% Triton X-100/PBS. Staining were performed by incubation with a rabbit anti-GFP antibody (MBL International) overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by anti-rabbit conjugated with Alexa488 antibody plus DAPI overnight at 4\u00b0C. Slices were washed 4 times for 15\u00a0min in PBS after incubation with primary and secondary antibodies. Then, slices were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium\u00a0(Vector Laboratories). Imaging of the whole neocortical region was performed in a LSM700 (Zeiss) confocal microscope equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 20x NA 0.8 objective with a 0.5x magnification. A total of 50-100 images (for each of the \u223c300\u00a0\u03bcm thick slices) were acquired, and maximum intensity projections were generated for analysis. All live-cell imaging experiments were performed in an inverted microscope Nikon Eclipse Ti-E (Nikon), equipped with a Plan Apo VC 100x NA 1.40 oil and a Plan Apo VC 60x NA 1.40 oil objective (Nikon), a Yokogawa CSU-X1-A1 spinning disk confocal unit (Roper Scientific), a Photometrics Evolve 512 EMCCD camera (Roper Scientific) and an incubation chamber (Tokai Hit) mounted on a motorized\u00a0XYZ stage (Applied Scientific Instrumentation) which were all controlled using MetaMorph (Molecular Devices) software. Coverslips were mounted in metal rings and imaged using an incubation chamber that maintains temperature and CO2 optimal for the cells (37\u00b0C and 5% CO2). Imaging was performed in the original full conditioned medium from neurons in culture.\u00a0For single-color videos, a laser channel used to visualize a specific fluorescently tagged protein was exposed for 100\u2013200\u00a0ms. For dual-color videos, different laser channels used to visualize fluorescently tagged proteins were sequentially exposed for 100\u2013200\u00a0ms. Total time and intervals of imaging acquisition for each experiment are indicated in each legend for Figure\u00a0and/or legend for Movie. To identify the axon, neurons were stained live with a CF640R-conjugated antibody to the AIS protein neurofascin (). For GFP-Sec61\u03b2, RTN4A-GFP and ER-BODIPY red tracker photobleaching, the experiments were performed using the ILas2 system (Roper Scientific). Different regions of the neuron (indicated in each figure legend) were bleached with high laser power after 5\u00a0s of\u00a0recording, and fluorescence recovery was analyzed for a period of 5\u00a0min with imaging acquisition every 1 s. Photoactivation of PA-GFP-\u03b1-Tubulin was performed on the FRAP setup and achieved by scanning the desired region 3 times at 6%\u201310% laser power with a Vortran Stradus 405\u00a0nm (100 mW) laser. Photoactivation was performed \u223c1\u00a0min before imaging acquisition every 1\u00a0min for 1 or 4 h, as indicated in figure legends. The forced coupling of cargoes to MT-driven motors has been described previously (, ). Briefly, hippocampal neurons were transfected with HA-KIFC1-MD-Strep plus GFP-SBP-RTN4A at DIV6 and imaged at DIV7 (Figure\u00a04B). Alternatively, hippocampal neurons were nucleofected in suspension at DIV0 and imaged at DIV2 (Figure\u00a05I). Strep-SBP uncoupling was prevented by adding NeutrAvidin to the cell medium after 1h of transfection. The inducible cargo trafficking assay was performed as describe previously (). Briefly, hippocampal neurons were transfected with HA-BicD-MD-FRB plus GFP or mCh-tagged FKBP-RTN4A at DIV4-5 and imaged at DIV6-7. To induce specific binding\u00a0of FRB and FKBP constructs, rapalog was added to a final concentration of 100nM for 1h. The heterodimerization system\u00a0was co-transfected with GFP-Sec61\u03b2, GFP-ATL1 or GFP-DP1 plus fill (Figure\u00a04C and Figure\u00a0S5A-D), RFP-TRIM46 (Figure\u00a04E), BFP-TRIM46 (Figure\u00a0S6B-E) or BFP-TRIM46 plus AnkG480-GFP (Figure\u00a0S6F), GFP-MT+TIP (Figure\u00a04G), GFP-CAMSAP2 (Figure\u00a04I), or PA-GFP-Tub (Figure\u00a04J). For live cell imaging, neurons were incubated with rapalog and immediately recorded every 1-2min for 1h. A stock solution of 0.5mg DiOC6(3) (3,3\u2032-Dihexyloxacarbocyanine Iodide) in ethanol was prepared, aliquoted, and keep it at \u221220\u00b0C. Fixed neurons were immediately incubated for 10\u00a0s at room temperature with fresh dilution of 2.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL DiOC6(3) (3,3\u2032-Dihexyloxacarbocyanine Iodide) in PBS, and then cells were washed 4 times with PBS before imaging (Figures S2A, S2B, S4A, and S5A). A\u00a0stock solution of 1mM ER-Tracker Red (BODIPY TR Glibenclamide) in DMSO was prepared, aliquoted, and keep it at \u221220\u00b0C.\u00a0Live neurons were washed twice with HBSS/calcium/magnesium, immediately incubated with 1\u03bcM ER-Tracker Red in HBSS/calcium/magnesium\u00a0for 30\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C, and then washed 3 times before imaging live in HBSS/calcium/magnesium medium (Figures S2C\u2013S2E). Data were collected and analyzed from 3-5 independent experiments. No specific strategy for randomization and/or stratification was employed. The studies were blind in data analysis. The distribution of different proteins was analyzed by using ImageJ. Plot profiles were generated from segmented lines traced along the transitional zone from the soma to the axon (Figures 2D, 3C, and 4C), or from proximal axon to medium-distal axon (Figures 3A, 3B, and 6E), or from initial to distal part of neurites of neurons at stage 2-3 (Figure\u00a05E). A segmented line was also traced from the periphery to the perinuclear region of a COS7 cell to generate the plot profile shown in Figure\u00a07B. Representative images and their corresponding plots are shown in each figure. Several segmented lines were traced along three dendrites and one portion of the axon captured in each image. Mean intensities in these regions were calculated using ImageJ. The mean intensities from the three dendrites were averaged and used to calculate the polarity index (PI). The following formula was used:, where Id is the mean dendrite intensity and Ia is the mean axonal intensity. Non-polarized proteins present a PI\u00a0= 0 (Id\u00a0= Ia), whereas PI > 0 or PI\u00a0< 0 indicates polarization toward dendrites or axons, respectively. Kymograph from live cell imaging were generated using ImageJ, as previously described (). Briefly, segmented lines of several thickness and length were traced from the soma to the axon (Figures 2K and 4E), along dendrite (Figures 3G and\u00a05H), along axon (Figures 3G, 3H, and 4J), or along neurite during axon formation and elongation (Figures 5F and 5G). Kymographs were generated from straightened lines by re-slicing stacks followed by z projection. All tracks were orientated so that anterograde movement occurred from left to right. Length of segmented line, as well as time of recording are shown in each kymograph. The shift in the distribution of RFP-TRIM46, GFP-CAMSAP2 and PA-GFP-Tub in neurons expressing the rapalog system imaged live\u00a0for 1h, were analyzed by kymographs. Segmented lines were traced from the soma to the axon (Figure\u00a04E), from the soma to the proximal segment of all neurites (Figure\u00a04I), or within the proximal axon (Figure\u00a04J) to measure the displacement per neuron and to calculate the mean shift between 0\u00a0min and 60\u00a0min of rapalog treatment. All of these proteins are remarkable stable in normal conditions,\u00a0and their displacement is observed only in the presence of rapalog. The mean intensity of the bleached area was obtained and corrected with background values, as well as the bleaching that occurred during image acquisition. Data were normalized with control fluorescence averaged over 5 initial frames before bleaching and stated as 100% intensity. Average curves from several neurons were obtained and represented. The mean intensity of the photoactivated area was obtained and corrected with background values. The mean intensity obtained from the first frame after photoactivation was stated as 1. Average curves from several neurons were obtained and represented. All images were taken at the same settings for light and exposure with parameters adjusted so that the pixel intensities were below saturation. To determine intensities from endogenous staining of CAMSAP2 and acetylated tubulin in neurons or COS7 cells, a ROI was manually drawn around the neuronal soma for CAMSAP2 staining (Figure\u00a04H), along the first 150\u00a0\u03bcm of axon (Figure\u00a07F) or around individual COS7 cells (Figure\u00a07C) for acetylated tubulin staining, and the mean intensity in the selected area was measured using ImageJ.\u00a0Intensities were averaged over multiple cells and normalized to intensities in control cells. Several segmented lines were traced along three dendrites and one portion of the axon and a ROI was drawn around the soma for each image. Mean intensities in these regions were calculated using ImageJ. The sum of three regions (axon\u00a0+ dendrite\u00a0+ soma mean intensities) was expressed as value 1 (Figures 3E and S3A). For axon tip / soma intensity ratios, 4-8 ROIs were drawn around axonal tips and then averaged, and 1 ROI was drawn around the soma for each image. Value 1 correspond to average axon tip / soma intensity\u00a0ratio in control condition (Figure\u00a0S1A). ImageJ plugin ComDet (https://github.com/ekatrukha/ComDet) was used to quantify the number of EB1 or MT+TIP -comets in the soma of neurons (Figures 4F and 4G, respectively), or number of EB1 comets in individual COS7 cells (Figure\u00a07D). Numbers were normalized to the corresponding area and averaged over multiple cells. The degree of neuronal migration was quantified by measuring the positions of the cell bodies of GFP-positive neurons within the cortex, using the Analyze Particle plugin from ImageJ. The relative position of neurons in the regions of interest was recorded in terms of distance between the ventricle and the pial surface. The position information, including neurons across the entire Z series in the entire electroporated neocortial region together with the top (pial surface) and bottom (ventricle) boundaries, were imported to Excel. Based on the relative position of each neuron and the total numbers of neurons counted, the radial cell distribution along the radial axis was obtained by further data processing using an Excel macro and expressed as percentage of migration. All statistical details of experiments, including the definitions and exact values of n, and statistical tests performed, are shown in Figures\u00a0and Figure\u00a0Legends. n represent the number of analyzed cells from at least three independent experiments. Data processing and statistical analysis were done in Excel and GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Sofware). Significance was defined as: ns-not significant, \u2217p\u00a0< 0.05, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.01, and \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.001. Statistical analysis includes: unpaired t test, pared t test, one-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett\u2019s\u00a0multiple comparison test, Kruskal\u2013Wallis test followed by a Dunn\u2019s multiple comparison Test, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The assumption of normality was checked using D\u2019Agostino-Pearson omnibus test. We thank Dr. Juan Bonifacino for sharing the GFP-KIF5A-rigor construct.

Our findings reveal the controlled dynamic of the neurogenic niche ontogeny and identify the Geminin family members as key regulators of the initial pool of adult neural stem cells. Neurons and glial cells are continuously produced throughout life. In the adult, a subpopulation of astrocytes (type B1) located in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) region of the lateral ventricles (LVs) retain stem cell properties; i.e., self-renewal and multilineage differentiation (). These cells have a multipolar shape, contact both the LV and the blood vessels, and are surrounded by multiciliated ependymal cells (, , ). The coordinated beating of ependymal cilia contributes to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics, which is crucial for the exposure of type B1 cells to trophic and metabolic signals and to clear toxins and waste from the brain (). Proper functioning of adult neurogenesis thus depends on the production and positioning of the controlled number of ependymal cells and type B1 astrocytes composing the neurogenic niche. Type B1 astrocytes and ependymal cells are both derived from radial glial cells (RGCs) between embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) and E15.5 and progressively acquire identical phenotypic markers (Sox2, Sox9, Nestin, and CD133) (, , ). However, in the adult, these cells have very different morphologies and fulfill different functions: e.g., although B1 astrocytes are reactivable quiescent neuronal progenitors, multiciliated ependymal cells are postmitotic throughout life (, , , ). It is totally unknown how these cells are allocated to the neurogenic niche and how they acquire their common characteristics and distinct identities and functions. Recent studies have demonstrated that GemC1 and Mcidas are early regulators of multiciliogenesis in different organs (, , , , , , ). Interestingly, these coiled-coil proteins, together with their antagonist Geminin, are part of the Geminin superfamily, which was initially characterized for its role in DNA replication control (, , ). More recently, Geminin was found to regulate neural cell fate and to be highly expressed in cycling type B1 cells in the adult SVZ (, ). Here we exploited high-resolution lineage-tracing techniques\u2014multi-addressable genome-integrative color (MAGIC) markers () and mosaic analysis with double markers (MADM) strategies ()\u2014in the mouse brain to show that type B1 astrocytes and ependymal cells share a common RGC progenitor. These RGCs first produce type B1 astrocytes through both symmetric and asymmetric divisions. Ultimately, ependymal cells are produced through terminal symmetric division. We also examined the role of antagonist regulators of DNA replication (GemC1 and Geminin) in lineage progression. We show that GemC1 promotes premature symmetric division of RGCs producing ependymal cells at the expense of astrocytes, whereas Geminin favors symmetric divisions producing type B1 astrocytes. Altogether, we show that ependymal cells and type B1 astrocytes share a common lineage in which type B1 cells are produced first, followed by a majority of ependymal cells. This dynamic can be modulated by the Geminin family members. Multiciliated ependymal cells are generated from RGCs around E15 (). To determine how these cells develop, we performed a single injection of 5-ethynyl-2\u2019-deoxyuridine (EdU) at E15.5 and studied the relative positions of EdU+ ependymal cells on the ventricular walls at post-natal day 15 (P15). EdU+ ependymal cells were often juxtaposed or close to each other (Figures S1A\u2013S1C). To quantitatively assess their spatial distribution, we performed a nearest neighbor distance (NND) analysis on the datasets. The NNDs among EdU+ ependymal cells were significantly shorter than in simulated random datasets, suggesting that ependymal cells born at the same time remain in the same area (Figure\u00a0S1D). To further test this possibility, we employed a genetic fate-tracing strategy. We crossed the Ai14 transgenic mouse line, which expresses tdTomato after\u00a0Cre-dependent excision of a \u201cfloxed stop\u201d cassette (), with Emx1-Cre, Gsh2-Cre, or Nkx2.1-Cre transgenic mice, which express Cre recombinase in the dorsal-medial, lateral, and ventral regions of the LVs, respectively (Figures 1A\u20131C). At P10, almost all ependymal cells were tdT+ in Cre-expressing ventricular walls (Figures 1D\u20131F), whereas they were tdT\u2212 in Cre-negative regions (Figures 1G\u20131I), showing that ependymal cells do not migrate out of their site of origin during maturation (Figures 1J\u20131M). We observed similar results in all caudo-rostral regions examined. Together, these results show that ependymal cells are produced locally and do not migrate long distances from their site of origin. Given that ependymal cells develop locally from RGCs, we labeled their progenitors at E14.5 in the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) by in utero electroporation and traced their lineage at later stages. We first verified that cells targeted by in utero electroporation (IUE) are cycling by injecting EdU at E13.5 or E14.5. The next day, 78%\u00a0\u00b1 2% of electroporated cells were indeed EdU+ (Figure\u00a0S2), confirming that cycling cells are preferentially transfected by IUE and that progenitor fate can be traced by this technique, as shown previously (, ). We then characterized the progeny of cells electroporated at\u00a0E14.5 with the H2B-GFP plasmid by immunostaining the V-SVZ at P10\u2013P15 with FoxJ1 and Sox9 antibodies to distinguish ependymal cells (FoxJ1+Sox9+) from other glial cells (FoxJ1\u2212Sox9+) (; Figures 2A and 2B). We observed that around two-thirds of GFP+ cells were ependymal cells, whereas most of the remaining FoxJ1\u2212 cells were Sox9+ astrocytes (Figure\u00a02C). We also performed FGFR1OP (FOP) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining to distinguish ependymal cells (multiple FOP+ basal bodies and GFAP\u2212) from astrocytes (FOP+ centrosome and GFAP+). Most electroporated cells close to the ventricular surface were either GFAP\u2212 ependymal cells containing multiple FOP+ basal bodies or GFAP+ astrocytes with one FOP+ centrosome (Figure\u00a02D). A ventricular contact emitting a primary cilium was also observed on GFP+ astrocytes (). The GFP+ astrocytes often had an unusual nuclear morphology with envelope invaginations, as reported recently (). Noteworthy, neuroblasts with their typical migratory morphology were observed deeper in the tissue and at a distance from the electroporated area in the direction of the olfactory bulb (data not shown). To further test whether some of the astrocytes originating from the electroporated RGCs could act as adult neural stem cells (type B1 astrocytes), we permanently labeled RGCs and their progeny by IUE of a transposable Nucbow vector at E14.5 (nuclear MAGIC markers; ) and administered EdU through the animals\u2019 drinking water for 14\u00a0days starting at P21 (Figure\u00a02E). One week after the end of EdU administration, EdU+Nucbow+ neurons were observed on each olfactory bulb section, showing that cells derived from electroporated RGCs at E14.5 are adult neural stem cells that give rise to olfactory bulb neurons (Figure\u00a02F and 2G). These results show that electroporation of RGCs at E14.5 labels multiciliated ependymal cells and adult neural stem cells (type B1 astrocytes) that are retained in the V-SVZ at adult stages. We then took advantage of the large panel of distinct colors produced by the MAGIC markers approach to trace and analyze\u00a0the lineage of ependymal cells. The V-SVZ of P15\u2013P20 brains electroporated with the Nucbow vector at E14.5 were immunostained with the ependymal marker FoxJ1 in far red, and colors were automatically analyzed to avoid any eye bias (Figures 3A\u20133C). Briefly, FoxJ1 staining was first used as a reference for the ventricular surface, and 25-\u03bcm-thick 3D image stacks of the ventricular whole-mounts were segmented as described previously (). Nucbow+ cells were then sorted as FoxJ1+ or FoxJ1\u2212 (Figure\u00a0S3; Figure\u00a03D). To define the criteria that identify two cells as sister cells, 2 independent researchers manually picked 49 pairs of cells with similar Nucbow colors (Figure\u00a0S4A). Both their color content (saturation, value, and hue in the RGB tridimensional space) and their 3D spatial distances were computed (Figure\u00a03E; Figures S4B and S4C). The maximum difference found for each of these parameters was chosen as a threshold for automatic analysis of all Nucbow+ cells in each brain (Figures S4D\u2013S4G). This automatic analysis of all cells from 6 electroporated brains (corresponding to a total of 7,668 Nucbow+ cells and 418 clones of 2 cells or more) showed that more than 80% of clones (with at least one Nucbow+FoxJ1+ cell) contained 8 or less cells, suggesting that most ependymal cells were derived from 3 or less cell divisions (Figures 3F and 3G; Figures S5A\u2013S5F). We excluded the largest clones (9 to 32 cells) because we noted that they were often labeled with the most frequent labels in the dataset (corresponding to the primary colors red, green, and blue), suggesting that merging of juxtaposed clones expressing the same label had occurred (Figure\u00a0S5G). Among the 349 clones with 8 or less cells, around half contained only 2 cells, suggesting that, at E14.5, most clones were generated from one terminal cell division of RGCs (n\u00a0= 6 mice; Figure\u00a03H). These 2-cell clones were composed of 1 or 2 FoxJ1+ cells in a 1:1 ratio, showing that the terminal division could be either symmetric or asymmetric (Figure\u00a03I). Interestingly, the 3D distance between cells was higher in mixed clones (clones composed of ependymal and non-ependymal cells) compared with pure ependymal clones (Figure\u00a03J), showing that FoxJ1\u2212 cells were deeper in the SVZ compared with FoxJ1+ cells in the VZ. Clones containing 3 to 8 cells were generated through 2 or 3 cell divisions, the last of which was either only symmetric (clones containing FoxJ1+ cells only) or both symmetric and asymmetric (clones containing FoxJ1+ and FoxJ1\u2212 cells). Interestingly, a majority of these clones contained more FoxJ1\u2212 cells than FoxJ1+ cells, suggesting that symmetric divisions giving rise to 2 FoxJ1\u2212 cells might have occurred in these clones (Figure\u00a03K). Lineage tracing experiments of RGCs using the MAGIC markers strategy thus show that ependymal cells originate from either one terminal symmetric division giving rise to 2 ependymal cells or 1 asymmetric division giving rise to 1 ependymal and 1 FoxJ1\u2212 cell. Most importantly, this analysis of a large number of clones distributed along the caudo-rostral and ventro-dorsal axis of the lateral wall of the LV of 6 different electroporated brains did not reveal any regional differences. This observation suggests that the ontogeny of the neurogenic niche can be determined by analyzing individual cells along the LV. To obtain more insight into the cellular mechanisms and the sequence of symmetric versus asymmetric divisions producing each clone, we used the MADM system coupled with IUE of Cre recombinase at E13.5 or E14.5 (Figure\u00a04A; ). In electroporated cells, Cre recombinase mediates interchromosomal recombination, which reconstitutes cytoplasmic enhanced GFP (EGFP, green) or tandem dimer Tomato (tdTomato, red). If recombination occurs in G2 phase of the cell cycle, and each red or green chromosome segregates in separate daughter cells (X segregation), then the two descendent lineages will be permanently labeled green or red by MADM events (Figure\u00a04B). Analysis of cell number and identity will thus allow direct assessment of the division pattern (symmetric versus asymmetric) and cell fate decision of the original dividing progenitors. Otherwise, if recombination occurs in G0/G1, or if both red and green chromosomes segregate in the same cell (Z segregation), then recombined cells appear yellow and will be excluded from the analysis (Figure\u00a04B). We thus induced Cre activity through IUE in MADM pregnant mothers at E13.5 or E14.5 and analyzed the V-SVZ at P15\u2013P20 after immunolabeling of centrioles combined with MADM cytoplasmic staining to identify the cell types composing each clone (Figure\u00a04C). This approach allowed a clonal study of green-red clones because the efficiency of recombination leading to green-red clones was low in these mice (mean number of clones per animal, 5), and most recombined cells were double-labeled (yellow) (Figure\u00a04C). Cells were considered a clone when their spatial distance was less than 100\u00a0\u03bcm, as defined previously by the Nucbow lineage-tracing experiments. Red or green cells located in the electroporated region of the V-SVZ were either multiciliated ependymal (E) cells, characterized by a few short processes and multiple FOP+ basal bodies in their cytoplasm associated with long cilia, or astrocytes (type B1), whose cell body and multiple long processes were deeper in the SVZ. These astrocytes contained 2 centrosomal centrioles that occasionally contacted the ventricular surface and extended a primary cilium. These cells were thus easily discriminated from multiciliated ependymal cells (identified by multiple centrioles and long cilia) or even neuroblasts, which displayed typical migrating morphologies in the direction of the olfactory bulb and were located deeper in the tissue at larger distances from the clone. When the cells of a clone were in close proximity, their cell body or processes often contacted each other, suggesting that they might maintain communication at the adult stage (Figures 4C\u20134G; Videos S1 and S2). We observed very few red or green cells alone (clone of 1 cell in Figure\u00a04H) or larger monochrome clones, if any, in the V-SVZ, suggesting that asymmetric divisions giving rise to one ventricular and one non-ventricular cell were rare in these experiments. In contrast, we found that, among the 44 clones of 2\u20136 cells, 48% of them contained 2 cells (21 clones), and 52% of them contained 3\u20136 cells (23 clones), which is in line with our findings above showing that half of the RGCs at E14.5 divided once to produce glial cells in the V-SVZ. At E13.5, RGCs also produced V-SVZ cells, but the majority divided twice or more because 90% of clones contained 3 or more cells (Figure\u00a04H). The distance between cells in a clone was higher at E13.5 compared with E14.5, showing that cells disperse as cell divisions proceed (Figure\u00a04I). Both the proportion of mixed clones (containing both ependymal and B1 cells; Figure\u00a04J) and the number of type B1 astrocytes (Figure\u00a04K) in the clones decreased at E14.5 compared with E13.5, suggesting that fewer type B1 astrocytes are produced compared with ependymal cells. Alternatively, type B1 astrocytes might be produced at earlier stages compared with ependymal cells. Noteworthy is that the distribution of astrocytes (B1) and ependymal cells in each clone revealed that astrocytes were produced at a lower rate than ependymal cells and that symmetric divisions producing 2 astrocytes (B1-B1) occurred more frequently at E13.5 than at E14.5 (Figure\u00a04L; Table S1). Together, these results show that ependymal cells and astrocytes are sister cells produced through symmetric (B1-B1 or E-E) and asymmetric (E-B1) divisions of RGCs at mid-gestation in the mouse forebrain. To gain more insight into the molecular regulation of RGC differentiation into type B1 astrocytes or ependymal cells, we perturbed these divisions with members of the Geminin superfamily, initially described as regulators of DNA replication (, ). Two members of this family (Mcidas and GemC1) were recently identified as master regulators of multiciliated ependymal cell fate (), whereas the other member, Geminin, was found to regulate neural cell fate and to be highly expressed in cycling type B1 cells in the adult SVZ (, ). We also confirmed that GemC1 and Geminin genes are expressed along the LV at E14.5, in the choroid plexus and the ventricular zone, respectively (Figure\u00a0S6). Moreover, ependymal cell differentiation was totally absent in cultured cells from the GemC1 full mutant, whereas it was slightly (although not significantly) increased in cultured cells from the Geminin conditional mutant (Figures S7B\u2013S7E). Overexpression of GemC1 through IUE at E13.5 or E14.5 dramatically increased ependymal cell differentiation at the expense of SVZ cells, as shown previously (Figures S7G\u2013S7I; ). Interestingly, because B1 cells were absent, pinwheels were not observed in densely GemC1-electroporated regions (Figures S7J and S7K) compared with neighboring areas in which GemC1 electroporation was sparse (Figure\u00a0S7L). Overexpression of GemC1 together with induction of Cre activity through IUE in MADM embryos at E14.5 did not change the size of the clones compared with controls, suggesting that most RGCs were already undergoing their last division at that stage (Figure\u00a05C). In contrast, when IUE was performed at E13.5, the clones were smaller compared with controls, suggesting that GemC1 induced premature exit from the cell cycle at that stage (Figure\u00a05C). Consistently, the average distance between cells in the GemC1 clones at E13.5 was smaller than in controls (compare Figures 4I and 5D; Mann-Whitney test, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0\u2264 0.01) and similar to E14.5 GemC1 (Figure\u00a05D). Furthermore, overexpression of GemC1 at E13.5 or E14.5 promoted the ependymal fate because the numbers of both pure ependymal clones and ependymal cells in the clones were dramatically increased compared with controls (two-proportion Z test between controls and GemC1: \u2217\u2217\u2217p \u2264 0.001; compare Figures 4J and 4K and 5E and 5F). Notably, although astrocytes were occasionally produced through symmetric divisions in controls, they were exclusively generated through asymmetric divisions with ependymal cells after GemC1 overexpression at E13.5 or E14.5. Indeed, no pairs of astrocytes were detected after GemC1 overexpression (Figure\u00a06F; Table S2). Geminin physically interacts with GemC1 and Mcidas (, ), but its role during ependymal cell generation is still unknown. We thus tested the influence of Geminin overexpression on the fate of RGCs through IUE with Cre in MADM pregnant mothers at E13.5 or E14.5 (Figures 6A and 6B). Notably, a majority of the clones contained type B1 astrocytes, characterized by an apical contact with a primary cilium and cytoplasmic extensions contacting blood vessels (Figure\u00a06B; Video S3; Table S3). The size of the clones was slightly increased both in E13.5 and E14.5 Geminin-overexpressing clones but similar to that of controls, suggesting that Geminin does not act on the rate of cell division in RGCs (Figure\u00a06C). Interestingly, the proportion of mixed clones and the number of type B1 astrocytes were not significantly increased after Geminin overexpression (two-proportion Z test between controls and Geminin: not significant, p > 0.05; compare Figures 4J and 4K and 6D and 6E; Figure\u00a06F). However, Geminin overexpression led to significant formation of clones containing only B1 cells, which was never observed in controls (two-proportion Z test between E14.5 control and E14.5 Geminin for the B1-only population: \u2217p \u2264 0.05; compare Figures 4 and 6D). Consistently, the number of symmetric divisions producing 2 astrocytes (B1-B1) increased significantly after Geminin overexpression at E14.5 compared with controls (Figure\u00a06F; Table S3). Altogether, these results show that ependymal cells and astrocytes are sister cells produced through symmetric or asymmetric divisions, the balance of which is modulated by the level of expression of Geminin family genes. Using a Cre-lox fate mapping technique and complementary MAGIC markers- and MADM-based clonal analysis, our study revealed how glial cells are produced in the V-SVZ during development. First, our results proved that ependymal cells are derived from RGCs all along the embryonic neuroepithelium (pallium and lateral and medial ganglionic eminences) and differentiate locally; ependymal progenitors born in a specific area of the VZ do not migrate long distances to colonize other areas of the neuroepithelium (Figure\u00a01). We then showed that ependymal cells and B1-type astrocytes appear at the end of neurogenesis, mainly through E-B1 asymmetric or E-E symmetric divisions of RGCs. B1-B1 symmetric divisions were less frequent and always combined with E-E or E-B1 divisions (Figure\u00a07). These glial cells have a low migratory capacity and often contact each other, even at the adult stage. Our study thus demonstrates that multiciliated ependymal cells and adult neural stem cells, ultimately forming the adult neurogenic niche, are sister cells that share a common origin. We also provide evidence that these cells are sequentially produced, with the bulk of B1 astrocytes being produced just before the bulk of ependymal cells. Interestingly, their respective numbers are precisely regulated by the Geminin family members. Overexpression of Geminin, a gene expressed more in cycling compared with quiescent neural stem cells () and in the ventricular zone at E14.5 (Figure\u00a0S6), favors B1-B1 symmetric divisions (Figure\u00a06F). On the contrary, overexpression of its antagonist, GemC1, at E14.5 induces premature terminal E-E divisions and leads to a sharp decrease in the final number of B1 cells (Figures 5E and 5F). Given that GemC1 expression is only detected in the choroid plexus at that stage (Figure\u00a0S6; ), one can hypothesize that it is expressed at very low and/or undetectable levels in these progenitors. Alternatively, GemC1 might be expressed at later stages of development because ependymal differentiation starts postnatally in controls (). Both possibilities should be tested further, but they might already explain why GemC1 expression at high levels and/or before its normal expression in progenitors leads to premature ependymal differentiation. The sequential expression of Geminin family members could thus be responsible for the temporal differences in glia production. The 2-fold presence of ependymal cells with respect to B1 cells () could result from the balance between the levels of expression of these genes. These findings raise the question of the fate decision mechanisms driving RGCs toward symmetric or asymmetric cell division. An analogous question was addressed by others concerning neuronal versus glial cell generation. Interestingly, it has been shown that the number of neurons produced by RG is predictable and that around one in 6 RGCs perform a gliogenic division only when they have exhausted their capacity to proliferate (). At early stages of corticogenesis, RGCs would thus divide asymmetrically to produce neurons and glial progenitors, which would then generate type B1 astrocytes and ependymal cells. Similarly, we found that RGCs generate more mixed clones and more astrocytes when they are electroporated at E13.5 than at E14.5 (Figures 4J and 4K). This suggests that astrocytes are produced earlier than ependymal cells. One might hypothesize that RGCs first give rise to astrocytes until they exhaust their proliferative capacity and yield two ependymal cells through symmetric cell division at later developmental stages. Further lineage studies would be required to identify whether/which neuronal subtypes are lineally related to V-SVZ glial cells (type B1 astrocytes and ependymal cells). Importantly, although ependymal cells become post-mitotic (), most V-SVZ astrocytes can be reactivated in the adult (). Altogether, this suggests that RGCs first produce quiescent daughter cells with the potential to enter the cell cycle again (type B1 astrocytes) and then post-mitotic ependymal cells. Interestingly, the description of distinct pathways of glial production via symmetric or asymmetric division unveils the existence of two separate fate decision mechanisms that occur subsequent to the last division of RGCs. This indicates that ependymal versus astrocyte specification might be dependent on the correct segregation of organelles (i.e., centrioles or mitochondria), which have been shown to influence neural stem cell self-renewal and fate decisions (, ). Noteworthy is that Geminin superfamily members were initially described as regulators of DNA replication. It would thus be of interest to determine whether fate decisions in RGCs are driven by DNA replication events following re-entry into the cell cycle. Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Nathalie Spassky (spassky@biologie.ens.fr). Mice were bred and the experiments were performed in conformity with French and European Union regulations and the recommendations of the local ethics committee (Comit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9thique en experimentation animale n\u00b0005). The date of the vaginal plug was recorded as embryonic day (E) 0.5 and the date of birth as postnatal day (P) 0. Healthy, immunocompetent animals were kept in a 12\u00a0h light /12\u00a0h dark cycle at 22\u00b0C and fed ad libitum. All the individuals used in our study were not previously subject to any unrelated experimental procedures. Pregnant females were used for IUE (see below), but their littermates and any other mice of both sexes\u00a0were randomly used for all experiments in this study. Emx1-Cre+/\u2212 (B6.129S2-Emx1tm1(cre)Krj/J, JAX stock #005628, ), Gsh2-Cre+/\u2212 (B6;CBA-Tg(Gsx2-icre)1Kess/J, a gift from the laboratory of N. Kessaris, ) and Nkx2.1-Cre+/\u2212 (C57BL/6J-Tg(Nkx2-1-cre)2Sand/J, JAX stock #008661, ) transgenic animals were crossed with R26:tdTomatomT/mT homozygous animals, also called Ai14 (B6;129S6-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze/J, ). The presence of the Cre transgene was assessed at birth by observing the neonatal brain (when the fluorescence is still visible through the skin with no fur) under the fluorescent stereo microscope. MADMGT/+ and MADMTG/+ transgenic animals were a gift from the laboratory of S. Hippenmeyer (). Heterozygous mice were crossed to obtain homozygous MADMGT/GT and MADMTG/TG animals. These homozygous mice were then mated to obtain MADMGT/TG embryos. Expression of the Cre Recombinase in MADMGT/TG embryos was achieved by IUE of pcX-Cre plasmid (1\u03bcg/\u03bcl, ) at E13.5 or E14.5. All transgenic mice lines were kept as B6D2F1/J or C57/Bl6 background. For all other experiments involving IUE, RjORL:SWISS pregnant females were used due to their fertility and their maternal instinct. RjORL:SWISS embryos were also used for the in situ hybridization experiment at E14.5 and cell culture. GemC1KO/KO homozygous animals were incrossed to obtain GemC1-deficient cell cultures. Gemininflox/KO mice and NestinCre \u00b1 were crossed in order to have Geminin-deficient glial progenitors in our culture system. All animals analyzed in this study were sacrificed at P15-P20, except for the adult mice sacrificed at P42 to assess the neurogenic potential of SVZ astrocytes, the embryos (and consequently, the mother, at E14.5-E15.5) used for the in situ hybridization studies or EdU-mediated assessment of cell cycle stage of electroporated cells, and newborn pups (P0-P2) used for the cell culture. In utero electroporation of mouse embryos was performed at E13.5 or E14.5. Pregnant females were injected subcutaneously with buprenorphine (0.1\u00a0mg/kg) 15\u00a0minutes prior to surgery. They were subsequently anaesthetized by isoflurane inhalation, the abdominal cavity opened and the uterine horns exposed. With a thin glass capillary (Harvard Apparatus), 1\u03bcl of plasmid in filtered PBS was injected together with FastGreen (0.025%, Sigma) into the LVs of the embryo. The final concentrations of plasmids were 1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcl PBCAG-Nucbow, 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcl CAG-hypBase, 0.1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcl CAG-seCre (), 1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcl CAG-H2B-GFP (a gift from the laboratory of X. Morin, ), 1\u03bcg/\u03bcl pCAGGS-Cre (a gift from the laboratory of X. Morin, ), or 1\u03bcg/\u03bcl pCAGGS-GemC1 or pCAGGS-Geminin (gifts from the laboratory of S. Taraviras, ). Immediately after injection, four pulses of 50\u00a0ms and 35\u00a0V were applied to the embryos\u2019 telencephalon at 950\u00a0ms intervals with an electroporator (CUY21 EDIT, Nepagene). Finally, the embryos were carefully placed back into the abdominal cavity and left to develop before sacrifice. To determine the spatial disposition of newborn ependymal cells and the cell cycle stage at the time of electroporation, 50\u00a0mg/kg body weight (8\u00a0mg/ml stock, dissolved in filtered PBS) of EdU (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was administered to pregnant mice by intraperitoneal injection. In the first case, a single injection was administered at E15.5. In the second one two injections were performed; the first one 2 hours before and the second one 2 hours after IUE. To assess the neurogenic potential of SVZ astrocytes, EdU was administered for 14\u00a0days through the drinking water (1\u00a0mg/ml) of P21 electroporated litters. EdU incorporation was detected using the Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor imaging kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific for Alexa Fluor 488, 594 or 647 staining), according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Briefly, V-SVZ wholemounts or fixed coronal sections of the forebrain or olfactory bulbs were permeabilized in blocking solution with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 1h. After washing with PBS, sections were incubated for 1 hour with the Click-iT reaction cocktail, protected from light. The sections were washed again and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the primary antibodies. After incubation with the secondary antibody for 2 hours and Hoechst staining, slices were mounted with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, 0100-01) mounting medium. Primary culture of ependymal cells was done like previously described (, ). Briefly, newborn mice (P0\u2013P2) were sacrificed by decapitation. Their brains were dissected in Hank\u2019s solution (10% HBSS, 5% HEPES, 5% sodium bicarbonate, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) in pure water) and the extracted ventricular walls were cut manually into small pieces, followed by enzymatic digestion (DMEM glutamax, 33% papain (Worthington 3126), 17% DNase at 10\u00a0mg/ml, 42% cysteine at 12\u00a0mg/ml, using 1\u00a0mL of the enzymatic digestion solution per brain) for 45\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Digestion\u00a0was stopped by addition of a solution of trypsin inhibitors (Leibovitz Medium L15, 10% ovomucoid at 1\u00a0mg/ml, 2% DNase at 10\u00a0mg/ml, using 1\u00a0mL of enzyme inhibiting solution per brain). The cells were then washed in L15 and resuspended in 1\u00a0mL per brain dissected of DMEM glutamax supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% P/S. Cells were then seeded in a Poly-L-lysine (PLL)-coated flask (1\u00a0mL per 75\u00a0cm2 flask), containing 5\u00a0mL of the same medium in which cells were resuspended. Ependymal progenitors proliferated for 5\u00a0days until confluence followed by shaking (250rpm) overnight at room temperature. Pure confluent astroglial monolayers were replated at a density of 7\u00a0\u00d7 104 cells per cm2 in DMEM glutamax, 10% FBS, 1% P/S on PLL-coated coverslides for immunocytochemistry experiments and maintained overnight. The medium was then replaced by serum-free DMEM glutamax 1% P/S, to trigger ependymal differentiation gradually in\u00a0vitro (DIV 0). When the immunostaining was performed on coronal sections of postnatal animals, these were previously anesthetized with a mixture of 100\u00a0mg of ketamine and 10\u00a0mg of xylazine per kg of body weight, and then were perfused transcardially with 4% PFA. Adult animals used for EdU-retaining olfactory bulb neuron analyses were not perfused, since no immunohistochemistry procedure was performed on them. After overnight fixation of the dissected brain in 4% PFA at 4\u00b0C, of either perfused or non-perfused postnatal mice or embryos, 80\u00a0\u03bcm-thick floating sections were cut on a vibratome. Wholemounts of the lateral walls of the LVs were dissected () from animals sacrificed by cervical dislocation and fixed for 15\u00a0minutes in 4% PFA at room temperature. Primary cultures of ependymal cells were fixed for 10\u00a0minutes in 4% PFA at room temperature. For in situ hybridization, an E14.5 pregnant female was sacrificed by cervical dislocation, the embryos were retrieved and their whole brains fixed for 3\u00a0days in 4% PFA at 4\u00b0C. The sectioning of the tissue was done like described above. Tissue samples and primary ependymal cell cultures were incubated for 1h in blocking solution (1X PBS with 0.1%\u20130.2% Triton X-100 and 10% fetal bovine serum) at room temperature. All these were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in the primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution. The primary antibodies used targeted CD24 (1:200, BD PharMingen), FoxJ1 (1:500, Thermo Fischer Scientific), GFP (1:1600, Aves Labs), Dsred (1:400, Clontech Laboratories), Sox9 (1:1200, Millipore), FOP (1:600, Abnova Corporation), GFAP (1:400, Millipore) ZO1 (1:100, Thermo Fischer Scientific), Gamma-tubulin (1:500, Sigma-Aldrich) and Acetylated-tubulin (1:400, Sigma-Aldrich). The following day, they were stained with species-specific AlexaFluor fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:400, Thermo Fischer Scientific or Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs, see Key Resources Table). Nuclei were counterstained with a 1:1500 Hoechst solution (from a 20\u00a0mg/ml stock, Sigma-Aldrich), containing the secondary antibodies for 2h at room temperature. Finally, the wholemounts were redissected to keep only the thin lateral walls of the LV () which were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Sigma, H-1000), for Nucbow samples, or Fluoromount-G mounting medium (Southern Biotech, 0100-01), for other stainings. Fluoromount-mounted slides were stored at 4\u00b0C, whereas Vectashield-mounted wholemounts were stored at \u221220\u00b0C to avoid color fading. Cell culture coverslides were mounted with Fluoromount-G. The GemC1 cDNA sequence was subcloned into a pBlueScriptKS plasmid by removing the former from the same pCAGGS-GemC1 plasmid used for GemC1 overexpression (see In Utero Electroporation, ). Both plasmids were doubly digested with XbaI and XhoI. Then the DNA fragment corresponding to the GemC1 cDNA size was isolated from an agarose gel and ligated to the pBlueScriptKS backbone, upstream of the T3 promoter sequence. The pBlueScriptKS-Geminin plasmid was a gift from the laboratory of S. Taraviras (). Briefly, in this study, the open reading frame of Geminin was cloned between the EcoRI/BamHI sites of the pBlueScriptKS plasmid, upstream of the T7 promoter sequence. pBlueScriptKS-GemC1 and pBlueScriptKS-Geminin were linearized with XbaI and EcoRI restriction enzymes. Using the T3 and T7 RNA polymerases (Sigma-Aldrich), respectively, DIG-labeled ribonucleotide mix (Sigma-Aldrich) and a Ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega), a DIG-labeled gene-specific RNA probe was generated, according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA probes were subsequently treated with a Deoxyribonuclease (Promega) for 20\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C. Once synthesized, the RNA probes were purified in a ProbeQuant G-50 Micro Column (Sigma-Aldrich). The in situ hybridization was performed as previously described (). Unless stated otherwise, washing steps were performed thrice for 5\u00a0min. Floating sections of E14.5 embryos were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature (RT) in the dark in 2% H2O2 in PBS-0.1% Tween-20 (PBT). After washing in PBT, sections were treated with Proteinase K (10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml in PBT) for 3-4\u00a0min at RT and then the reaction was stopped in a 2mg/ml glycine solution in PBT for 5\u00a0min at RT. After washes in PBT, samples were postfixed in 0.2% glutaraldehyde in 4% PFA for 30\u00a0min at RT. The tissue was washed again in PBT and then incubated for 1 hour at 60\u00b0C in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5X SSC, 1% SDS, 50\u00a0\u03bcg/ml heparin and 50\u00a0\u03bcg/ml yeast tRNA, in water). RNA probes were diluted at 5-10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml in hybridization buffer and incubated with the samples at 60\u00b0C overnight. The next day, sections were washed twice in a 50% formamide, 5X SSC, 1% SDS solution, for 30\u00a0min at 60\u00b0C. They were washed again twice in a 50% formamide, 2X SSC, 0,5% SDS solution, for 30\u00a0min at 60\u00b0C. Washing at RT in TBST (0.08% NaCl, 0.002%KCl, 2.5mM Tris, from a 1M Tris pH\u00a0= 7.5 stock, 0.01% Tween-20) followed and blocking in 10% FBS in TBST for 1h 30\u00a0min at RT. An anti-DIG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) was diluted in blocking solution (1:2000) and incubated with the samples overnight at 4\u00b0C. The next day, at least 8 washes in TBST and 3 in NTMT (100\u00a0mM NaCl, 100\u00a0mM Tris, from a 1M Tris pH\u00a0= 9.5 stock, 50\u00a0mM MgCl2, 0.01% Tween-20) for 10\u00a0min were done. Finally, color developing was performed in a 0.35% vol/vol BCIP (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.34% vol/vol NBT (Sigma-Aldrich) solution, from a 50 and 100\u00a0mg/ml stock dilution in dimethylformamide, respectivelty, in NTMT. Fixed slices or LV wholemounts were examined with an upright Zeiss Axio Observer.ZI epifluorescence microscope, using an apochromat 63\u00a0\u00d7 1.4 NA objective and a Zeiss Apotome with an H/D grid. Confocal image stacks were collected with a 40\u00a0\u00d7 1.3 NA water objective on Olympus FV1000 and FV1200 microscopes, or with a 40\u00a0\u00d7 1.4 NA oil objective or a 63\u00a0\u00d7 1.4 NA oil objective on an inverted LSM 880 Airyscan Zeiss microscope with 440, 515 and 560 laser lines to excite, independently, Cerulean, mEYFP and mCherry, or Alexa 488, 594 and 633/Cy5. Finally, images of the in situ hybridization sections were taken with a Leica MZ16\u00a0F Fluorescence Stereo Microscope (Leica Microsystems), equipped with a plan-apochromatic objective 1.0x (Leica, 10447157) and a Nikon DS-Ri1 High Resolution Color Camera (Nikon), with the assistance of the NIS-Element F Ver5.502 Imaging Software (Nikon). For clarity, mCherry, EYFP and Cerulean Nucbow signals are represented as red, green and blue (RGB) values. 1) Local apical layer extraction: to maintain consistency among datasets, only cells within 25\u00a0\u03bcm of the apical surface were considered using the SME projection tool on the FoxJ1-stained cell nuclei (). 2) Segmentation of ependymal cells stained with FoxJ1: the 3D volume occupied by each cell nucleus was delineated using FoxJ1 far red staining. RGB information was extracted from the segmented mask using the following steps implemented as a Fiji macro: Noise was reduced in a preprocessing step using 3D Gaussian filtering, where the sigma values of the Gaussian kernel was set to 1/3rd of the estimated mean nuclear radius in 3D. This was followed by Log3D filtering () to select objects corresponding to nuclear size; the local 3D maximum was then detected to determine the center of each cell nucleus. 3D-seeded watershed segmentation was performed from these maxima to accurately detect the nuclear border in 3D. This 3D segmentation mask was used to compute the volume and the mean color of each nucleus. 3) Segmentation of non-ependymal cells: After elimination of FoxJ1-positive ependymal cells, only FoxJ1-negative non-ependymal cells remained in the 25\u03bcm apical layer. Since there is no specific marker for these cells, they were characterized by their color information as follows: Projection: projection of the Nucbow color channels was maximized to obtain a 2D representation of all labeled non-ependymal cells. Color gradient extraction: In order to accentuate nuclear borders, the image gradient was computed from the sum of the intensities of the three RGB channels. The gradient image was further filtered with adaptive Gaussian filtering to improve the signal to noise ratio. The adaptive filter augments smoothing where the image gradient is weak and decreases smoothing where the gradient is high, in order to preserve nuclear edges. Watershed segmentation: Local maxima were extracted from the inverted smoothed gradient response to retrieve one maximum per nucleus. The seeded watershed transform was then used () to detect cells in 2D. 4) Color normalization: RGB channels were rescaled linearly from 0 and the 99th percentile of their intensity distribution to ensure alignment of their relative intensity (1% of the most saturated cells were therefore excluded from the analysis of each sample). 5) Determination of clonal lineage: To identify the cell lineage, each cell was characterized by the median R G B values and their spatial location in 3D X, Y, Z. RGB values were converted to their equivalent in the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space as described in . This conversion was performed in MATLAB with the HEXCONE model proposed by . Quantification, image and statistical analyses were performed with Fiji (), MATLAB (Mathworks, USA), Excel, and GraphPad Prism software. Quantifications throughout the study are represented as the mean value, with the exception of the clone size representation, which indicates the clone size frequency distribution (only Figure\u00a04H), as well as the Gaussian non-linear regression curve fitting the frequency of clones of variable sizes (from 1 to 8 cells per clone, Figure\u00a04H, 5C, 6C). Error bars indicate the Standard Error of the Mean (SEM), except for Figure\u00a0S1C, in which the Standard Deviation (SD) is depicted. P values in this manuscript present the following star code: ns: p > 0.05 (non-significant), \u2217p \u2264 0.05, \u2217\u2217p \u2264 0.01, \u2217\u2217\u2217p \u2264 0.001. In order to characterize the spatial origin of ependymal cells and the presence or absence of ependymal progenitor cell migration, we considered two areas along the ventricular wall in the Cre-expressing animals; a Cre-positive area, or the anatomical part of the ventricle directly derived from the embryonic Cre-expressing area (Dorsal and Dorsal Medial Walls in the Emx1Cre mice, the Lateral Wall in the Gsh2Cre mice and the ventral-most region of the wall in the Nkx2.1Cre animals), and a Cre-negative area, or the anatomical part of the ventricle that is not derived from the embryonic Cre-expressing area, according to the literature. In the Emx1-cre; Ai14 group, 14 images from n\u00a0= 6 animals were analyzed, with 1615 counted cells in the Cre-positive area and 1723 cells in the Cre-negative area. For the Gsh2-cre; Ai14 individuals, 15 images from n\u00a0= 4 animals were used for quantification, with 383 and 895 cells counted on the Cre-positive and Cre-negative anatomical areas, respectively. Finally, 16 images from n\u00a0= 5 Nkx2.1-cre; Ai14 animals were used, with a total of 496 and 2367 cells analyzed in the Cre-positive and negative areas, respectively. To determine whether the differences between the Cre-positive and negative areas were significant, we performed a Mann-Whitney\u00a0test. 19 images containing 441 V-SVZ electroporated (H2B-GFP positive) cells were analyzed in n\u00a0= 3 different animals. The differences between cell types (astrocytes or FoxJ1-Sox9+, ependymal or FoxJ1+Sox9+, and unknown cell type or FoxJ1-Sox9-) were determined in pairs via the Mann-Whitney test. We assessed n\u00a0= 6 V-SVZ wholemounts electroporated with the MAGIC markers (Nucbow). The automated analysis of such samples yielded 7668 Nucbow+ cells, which could be regrouped in clones of cells, i.e., cells with a common progenitor, based on their color characteristics (see Method Details). 1142 Nucbow+ cells that belonged to 163 clones with 2 cells (326 cells) or 186 clones with 3 to 8 cells (816 cells) and that contained at least one FoxJ1+ cell were taken into account. These 349 clones represented the 83% of all 418 clones found by the automated analysis with at least one FoxJ1+ cell. The 17% remaining clones had 9 to 32 cells and they were excluded from the analysis. Clones of 2 cells (163 of the 349 total clones) were categorized in clones formed by 2 ependymal cells (only FoxJ1+) or 1 ependymal and 1 non-ependymal cells (FoxJ1+\u00a0= FoxJ1-). Clones of 3 to 8 cells (186 of the 349 total clones) were subdivided in clones formed by exclusively ependymal cells (only FoxJ1+), clones with as many or more ependymal cells as non-ependymal cells (FoxJ1+ \u2265 FoxJ1-), or clones with less ependymal than non-ependymal cells (FoxJ1+\u00a0< FoxJ1-). The difference between the frequency of clones with 2 or 3 to 8 cells, as well as the difference between the percentage of types of clones (only FoxJ1+, FoxJ1+\u00a0= FoxJ1-, FoxJ1+ \u2265 FoxJ1-, FoxJ1+\u00a0< FoxJ1-), were determined in two-by-two comparisons with the Mann-Whitney test. The 3D-distance between cells in pure ependymal clones and between cells in mixed clones (with at least one FoxJ1- cell) was calculated automatically and the p value was assessed using the Mann-Whitney test, as well. In all, 314 clones of 2 or more cells were analyzed (29 E13Ctrl, 20 E13GemC1, 73 E13Geminin, 44 E14Ctrl, 41 E14GemC1 and 107 E14 Geminin), which counted for 1069 cells (117 E13Ctrl, 56 E13GemC1, 317 E13Geminin, 134 E14Ctrl, 110 E14GemC1 and 335 E14Geminin), obtained from 52 electroporated embryos (6 E13Ctrl, 4 E13GemC1, 8 E13Geminin, 16 E14Ctrl, 9 E14GemC1 and 13 E14Geminin). To assess the percentage of types of clones (Ependymal only versus Mixed and versus B1 astrocytic only), and cells (Ependymal versus B1 astrocytes), all clones were grouped, independently of animals, since the efficiency of the IUE technique and the Cre recombination in MADM mice are highly variable. This resulted in the problem of having animals with a very small number of clones (one or two) and animals with a very large number (up to 26) and, hence, not having the same weight in the statistical analysis. In order to study the difference of clone types and cell proportion among the different categories, a two-proportion Z-test was performed in each case. The differences in cell division type (Ependymal symmetric, E-E, B1 astrocytic symmetric, B1-B1, or asymmetric, E-B1) were assessed with the Mann-Whitney test. Finally, the clone size distribution (number of cells per clone) for each category was represented as a Gaussian non-linear regression curve, fitting the frequency of clones with several sizes (from 1 to 8 cells per clone). The differences in the clone size distribution were determined via a Chi2 test for trend. The distance between cells in a clone was determined by assessing the mean distance between pairs of cells in a clone, when they\u00a0possessed more than 2 cells, or the only distance between the unique pair of cells in clones with 2 cells. The significance of the difference in such distance was calculated using the Mann-Whitney test. 17 and 12 coronal sections of electroporated brains with stained EdU were analyzed for the E13.5 and E14.5 brains (n\u00a0= 3 for each category). In these, the percentage of EdU retaining cells was assessed. The p value was calculated using the Mann-Whitney test. 41 and 15 coronal sections were analyzed for the H2B-GFP and GemC1/H2B-GFP-electroporated brains, respectively. A total of 4434 and 1953 H2B-GFP+ ependymal (multi-FOP stained) and non-ependymal cells (two-dot FOP stained) were counted in the V-SVZ of 3 control and 3 GemC1 brains. Even though the number of animals was the same, the difference in analyzed sections and counted cells is due to the variability of the electroporation, which causes that some brains are electroporated over a wide area, whereas others are targeted by the electroporation in a restrained zone. The difference between the percentage of electroporated ependymal cells (over the total electroporated cells) in both categories was determined with a Mann-Whitney test. n\u00a0= 4 cultures for WT, n\u00a0= 2 for GemC1KO/KO and n\u00a0= 4 for GemininFL/KO;NestinCre \u00b1 were quantified. In all 1015, 637 and 1638 cells were counted for each one of the genotypes, respectively. The percentage of differentiation in each condition was normalized to the WT (control). The differences between genotypes were determined in pairs using the Mann-Whitney test. Several macros were created using the MATLAB software to use for the automatic analysis of MAGIC markers.

These results reveal a dedicated retina-vLGN/IGL-LHb circuit that regulates depressive-like behaviors and provide a potential mechanistic explanation for light treatment of depression.  Light signals transmitted by the retina are a powerful modulator of mood-related behaviors (). Clinical evidence supports an antidepressive effect of light therapy (, , , , , , , ), while light deprivation can increase depressive-like behaviors across species (, , , ). Unveiling the structure and function of neural circuits related to the retina is crucial for understanding how light exerts its influence on depressive-like behaviors. The lateral habenula (LHb), part of the epithalamus, is a highly conserved nucleus across species, and it regulates the flow of information from the limbic system to the midbrain monoaminergic centers (). Aversive stimuli (AS) can activate the LHb and lead to increases in depressive-like behaviors (, , , , ), whereas inhibition of the LHb ameliorates depressive symptoms (). Recent studies conducted in rodents have suggested that light can influence neuronal activity in the LHb, accompanied by changes in depressive-like behaviors (, ). However, the visual circuits related to the LHb that regulate depressive-like behaviors remain incompletely understood. Here, by combining conventional neurotracer and transneuronal virus tracing techniques, we identified a disynaptic visual circuit connecting the retina and LHb in the mouse. In the retina, a subset of M4-type retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) innervate GABA neurons in the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus and intergeniculate leaflet (vLGN/IGL), which in turn inhibit the neural activity of the LHb. The role of the retina-vLGN/IGL-LHb pathway in the regulation of depressive-like behaviors was investigated using an array of brain circuit interrogation tools, including fiber photometry, c-Fos brain mapping, and chemogenetics. We demonstrate that the activation of the retina-vLGN/IGL-LHb pathway is required for the antidepressive effects of bright light therapy. Results derived from the mouse mesoscale connectome suggest that GABA neurons in the vLGN/IGL project to the LHb (). To further determine the distribution pattern and identity of LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons, we first delivered a Cre-dependent virus encoding a red fluorescent protein, mCherry (AAV2/9-DIO-mCherry), into the vLGN/IGL of vGAT-Cre mice to selectively infect GABA neurons, after which we injected the LHb with green fluorescent latex microspheres (retrobeads) to retrogradely label LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons (Figure\u00a0S1A). We found that LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons labeled with retrobeads were mainly distributed in the external part of the vLGN and IGL, in which \u223c93.88% of retrobead-labeled LHb-projecting neurons were co-labeled with mCherry (Figure\u00a0S1A). It is well established that most LHb neurons are excitatory (). To determine whether vLGN/IGL neurons specifically target LHb excitatory neurons, we delivered the monosynaptic anterograde transport virus AAV2/1-Cre () into the vLGN/IGL and a Cre-dependent virus encoding the yellow fluorescent protein EYFP (AAV2/9-DIO-EYFP) into the LHb of C57BL/6 mice (Figure\u00a0S1B). Approximately 99.33% of the LHb postsynaptic neurons expressing EYFP were immunoreactive for CaMKII\u03b1 (Figure\u00a0S1B), indicating the excitatory nature of these cells. To identify the projection targets of the LHb postsynaptic neurons, we first labeled axons and presynaptic terminals of LHb postsynaptic neurons by injecting AAV2/1-Cre into the vLGN/IGL and AAV2/9-DIO-tdTomato-T2A-synaptophysin-EGFP into the LHb (Figure\u00a0S2A). We found that LHb neurons receiving direct vLGN/IGL input could innervate midbrain monoaminergic centers, including the dorsal raphe nuclei (DRN) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) (Figures S2B\u2013S2D). Next, we infected LHb postsynaptic neurons with AAV2/9-DIO-EYFP and retrogradely labeled DRN-projecting LHb neurons and VTA-projecting LHb neurons by injecting red retrobeads into the DRN and VTA, respectively (Figures S2E and S2I). We found that \u223c39.9% of LHb postsynaptic neurons expressing EYFP projected to the DRN, while 45.6% of LHb postsynaptic neurons expressing EYFP projected to the VTA (Figures S2E\u2013S2L). These results provide direct evidence that a subgroup of vLGN/IGL GABA neurons synapse onto LHb excitatory neurons, which could further project to the DRN and VTA. To explore the functional contribution of vLGN/IGL-LHb projections, we delivered the monosynaptic retrograde transport virus rAAV2/2-Retro-Cre () into the LHb of C57BL/6 mice and a Cre-dependent virus encoding channelrhodopsin-2 and EYFP (AAV2/9-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP) into the vLGN/IGL (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1C). Next, we optogenetically activated vLGN/IGL-LHb projections and recorded postsynaptic currents from LHb CaMKII\u03b1 neurons (Figure\u00a01C). Blue light evoked exclusively inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in 43.8% of recorded neurons, but both IPSCs and excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in 39.6% of recorded neurons, in which the amplitude of IPSCs is higher than that of EPSCs (Figures 1C and 1D). Furthermore, we found that the inhibitory effects of vLGN/IGL-LHb projections could be blocked by the GABAA receptor antagonist SR95531, while the excitatory effects could be blocked by the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist CNQX (Figure\u00a01E). Finally, we tested the effects of stimulation of vLGN/IGL-LHb projections on the neuronal activity of LHb neurons. Optogenetic activation of ChR2-positive axon terminals inhibited both spontaneous firing and current-evoked action potentials in LHb neurons, and these effects were blocked by the application of SR95531 (Figures 1F and 1G). These results indicate that vLGN/IGL neurons transmit predominantly inhibitory input to LHb CaMKII\u03b1 neurons. Recent evidence suggests that LHb excitatory neurons encode AS (, , , ). We postulated that after animals were exposed to AS, the subsequent activation of LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons could attenuate the activation of LHb excitatory neurons. To test this hypothesis, we first injected rAAV2/2-Retro-Cre into the LHb and infected LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons with a Cre-dependent virus encoding the neuronal activator DREADD hM3D (AAV2/9-DIO-hM3D-mCherry) (Figures 2A and 2B). Next, we used fiber photometry (, ) to quantitatively measure AS (foot shock, air puff, fox urine, or physical restraint)-induced changes in Ca2+ signals in LHb CaMKII\u03b1 neurons expressing the Ca2+ indicator GCaMP6m (Figures 2C and 2D). We observed that AS reliably evoked robust activation of LHb CaMKII\u03b1 neurons, whereas chemogenetic activation of LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons significantly decreased the excitatory effects of AS (Figures 2E and S3). Together, we demonstrate that neuronal activity of LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons attenuates the activation of LHb excitatory neurons induced by AS. Recent studies imply that increased aberrant LHb neuronal activity (e.g., hyperexcitability and increases in burst firing) induced by long-term exposure to AS leads to an increase in depressive-like behaviors (, , , , ). This prompted us to explore the influence of LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons on the depressive-like behaviors and aberrant activity of LHb neurons induced by long-term exposure to AS. We delivered rAAV2/2-Retro-Cre into the bilateral LHb and infected LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons with AAV2/9-DIO-hM3D-mCherry or AAV2/9-DIO-mCherry (Figures 3A and 3B). After 28\u00a0days of exposure to AS (foot shock, 20 times/day; air puff, 20 times/day; fox urine, 30\u00a0min/day; physical restraint, 1 h/day), mice were subjected to a battery of depression- and anxiety-related behavioral tests (Figure\u00a03A). Long-term exposure to AS significantly increased depressive-like behaviors tested in the sucrose preference test (SPT), forced swimming test (FST), and shuttle box test (SBT) (Figure\u00a03C) and anxiety-like behaviors tested in the open field test (OFT), elevated plus maze test (EPM), and novelty-suppressed feeding test (NSF) (Figure\u00a0S4A). By contrast, the locomotor activities of these mice were not significantly different (Figure\u00a0S4A), which indicated that the increased depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors were not due to motor defects. Moreover, depressive-like behaviors were reversed by antidepressant treatment (fluoxetine, injected intraperitoneally [i.p.] at 10\u00a0mg/kg daily for 14\u00a0days) (Figure\u00a03C). Furthermore, we found that LHb neurons from mice with long-term exposure to AS exhibited a higher number of action potentials in response to current injections, an elevated spontaneous firing rate, and increased burst firing (Figures 3D, 3E, and S4B), indicating that long-term exposure to AS increased the excitability and burst firing of LHb neurons. We next investigated the influence of the activation of LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons on depressive-/anxiety-like behaviors and the aberrant activity of LHb neurons. During the last 14\u00a0days of exposure to AS, LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons infected with hM3D-mCherry were activated daily via i.p. injection of clozapine N-oxide (CNO) (2\u00a0mg/kg) (Figure\u00a03A). Activation of LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons significantly decreased depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors, and this decrease was accompanied by significantly reduced excitability and burst firing in the LHb (Figures 3C\u20133E, S4A, and S4B). In addition to the LHb, vLGN/IGL GABA neurons can also project to other mood-related nuclei, including the suprachiasmatic nucleus and superior colliculus (). The antidepressive and anxiolytic effects of chemogenetic activation of LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons might be due to altered functions in related brain regions other than the LHb. To determine whether the specific activation of the vLGN/IGL-LHb pathway is sufficient to decrease depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors, we next injected AAV2/1-Cre into the bilateral vLGN/IGL and infected LHb postsynaptic neurons with a Cre-dependent virus encoding the neuronal inhibitor DREADD hM4D (AAV2/9-DIO-hM4D-mCherry) (Figure\u00a03F). During the last 14\u00a0days of exposure to AS, LHb neurons expressing hM4D-mCherry were inhibited daily via i.p. injection of CNO (Figures 3A and S4C). We found that specific inhibition of LHb postsynaptic neurons also significantly decreased depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors, accompanied by reduced excitability and burst firing of LHb neurons (Figures 3G\u20133I, S4D, and S4E). Thus, activation of the vLGN/IGL-LHb pathway is sufficient to ameliorate depressive and anxiety-like symptoms induced by long-term exposure to AS. Given that activation of the vLGN/IGL-LHb pathway during the last 14\u00a0days of exposure to AS corresponds to a prevention protocol rather than a treatment protocol for depression, we next tested whether activation of the vLGN/IGL-LHb pathway could reverse depressive symptoms after the induction of depression by AS. We used a 38-day protocol in which 10\u00a0days of daily chemogenetic activation of the LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons expressing hM3D-mCherry or inhibition of the LHb postsynaptic neurons expressing hM4D-mCherry was conducted after exposing the mice to 28\u00a0days of AS (Figure\u00a0S5A). We found that both the activation of LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons and the inhibition of LHb postsynaptic neurons reversed the depressive and anxiety-like symptoms induced by long-term exposure to AS (Figures S5B and S5C). It is widely accepted that exposure to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) could increase depressive-like behaviors in mice (, ), and a recent study found that social attack intensively activated the LHb (). Next, we further examined the antidepressive and anxiolytic effects of the vLGN/IGL-LHb pathway in a CSDS mouse model. To determine whether the activation of the vLGN/IGL-LHb pathway could prevent the behavioral deficits induced by exposure to CSDS, we exposed the mice to 10\u00a0days of SDS and daily activated LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons expressing hM3D-mCherry or inhibited LHb postsynaptic neurons expressing hM4D-mCherry via i.p. injection of CNO (Figure\u00a0S6A). Both the activation of LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons and the inhibition of LHb postsynaptic neurons significantly decreased depressive-like behaviors tested in the social interaction test (SI) and SPT, as well as anxiety-like behaviors tested in the EPM and NSF, and these changes were accompanied by reduced excitability and burst firing in the LHb (Figures S6B\u2013S6G). To determine whether the activation of the vLGN/IGL-LHb pathway could reverse the behavioral deficits induced by exposure to CSDS, we used a 20-day protocol in which 10\u00a0days of daily chemogenetic activation of LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons or inhibition of LHb postsynaptic neurons was conducted after exposing the mice to 10\u00a0days of SDS (Figure\u00a0S7A). We found that both the activation of LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons and the inhibition of LHb postsynaptic neurons reversed depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors (Figures S7B and S7C). Together, these observations indicate that activation of the vLGN/IGL-LHb pathway is also able to alleviate the depressive- and anxiety-like symptoms induced by exposure to CSDS. It is well established that RGCs project to the vLGN/IGL (). To determine whether LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons receive direct innervation from RGCs, we used a transsynaptic tracing method based on a modified rabies virus (, ). vLGN/IGL neurons were infected with AAV expressing the rabies glycoprotein and histone-tagged GFP (Helper) (Figures 4A and 4B), which is required for the replication of rabies virus (). Next, we injected SAD-\u0394G-DsRed (EnvA) into the LHb to infect Helper+ LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons via their presynaptic terminals (Figures 4A and 4B). The double-infected rabies-DsRed+/glyco-EGFP+ vLGN/IGL relay neurons (starter cells) produced infectious \u0394G-rabies-DsRed that propagated transneuronally to infect the RGCs that form synapses with them (Figure\u00a04B). We observed that starter cells were mainly distributed in the external part of the vLGN and IGL (Figures 4C and S8A). In\u00a0the retina, \u223c146\u00a0\u00b1 31 RGCs were labeled with rabies virus (n\u00a0= 6 retinas; Figures 4C, S8A, and S8B). Most of the rabies-virus-labeled RGCs were immunopositive for SMI-32 (92.97%) and exhibited morphological features similar to M4-type melanopsin-expressing RGCs (mRGCs) (), including large perikarya (20\u00a0\u00b1 2\u00a0\u03bcm, n\u00a0= 106 cells), trunk-like axons, and radially oriented dendritic processes that stratify in the ON sublamina of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) (Figures 4C\u20134E). Visual response properties of rabies-virus-labeled RGCs were tested in 21 cells. All cells responded at light onset with action potentials (Figure\u00a04D). To further determine whether the rabies-virus-labeled RGCs belong to M4-type mRGCs, we conducted disynaptic tracing in Opn4-Cre mice, in which mRGCs (including M4-type mRGCs) express Cre recombinase (, ). We observed that \u223c76.4% of rabies-virus-labeled RGCs were co-labeled with mRGCs expressing EYFP (Figure\u00a04F), suggesting that M4-type mRGCs can form disynaptic connections with the LHb through the vLGN/IGL. Given that axon terminals of RGCs release the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate (), and in view of our finding that activation of the vLGN/IGL-LHb pathway decreased depressive-like behaviors, we tested the effects of specific activation of the vLGN/IGL-projecting RGCs in a depressive-like mouse model induced by long-term exposure to AS. To determine whether the activation of the vLGN/IGL-projecting RGCs could prevent AS-induced depressive symptoms, we chemogenetically activated the vLGN/IGL-projecting RGCs expressing hM3D-mCherry during the last 14\u00a0days of exposure to AS (Figures 5A\u20135C). We found that specific activation of vLGN/IGL-projecting RGCs prevented the development of depressive symptoms (Figure\u00a05C). To test whether activation of vLGN/IGL-projecting RGCs could reverse AS-induced depressive symptoms, we conducted 10\u00a0days of daily chemogenetic activation of the vLGN/IGL-projecting RGCs expressing hM3D-mCherry after exposing the mice to 28\u00a0days of AS (Figure\u00a05D). Chemogenetic activation of the vLGN/IGL-projecting RGCs also reversed depressive-like behaviors (Figure\u00a05D). The above observations demonstrate that LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons received M4-type mRGC input and that their activity inhibited LHb and suppressed depressive-like behaviors. We hypothesized that increased light detected by vLGN/IGL-projecting RGCs could inhibit neural activity in the LHb and ameliorate depressive symptoms through LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons. To test this hypothesis, we first tested whether exposure to bright light attenuates the activation of LHb excitatory neurons through recording the Ca2+ signals in LHb CaMKII\u03b1 neurons expressing GCaMP6m with fiber photometry. We found that exposure to bright light (3,000 lux) impaired AS-induced activation of LHb excitatory neurons (Figures 6A and S9A), indicating that LHb neurons encoding AS can be inhibited by visual light stimulation. Next, we evaluated the efficacy of bright light therapy in a depressive-like mouse model induced by exposure to 28\u00a0days of AS. During the last 14\u00a0days of exposure to AS, animals received 2\u00a0h of daily light therapy of various intensities (70 lux, 600 lux, 2,000 lux, 3,000 lux, or 5,000 lux) (Figure\u00a06B). We found that light therapy prevented the development of depressive symptoms and reduced the excitability and burst firing of LHb neurons in an intensity-dependent manner (Figures 6C\u20136E and S9B). Furthermore, light therapy (3,000 lux, 2 h/day) also reversed depressive symptoms induced by long-term exposure to AS or CSDS (Figures S10A and S10B). In contrast, light therapy did not decrease anxiety-like behaviors induced by long-term exposure to AS or CSDS (Figures S9CS10A, and S10B), probably due to the excitatory effects of light exposure on anxiety-related brain regions, such as the amygdala (Figures S10C and S10D) (). To evaluate the role of the vLGN/IGL-LHb pathway in light therapy, we expressed Cre recombinase in LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons by injection of rAAV2/2-Retro-Cre into the bilateral LHb and infected LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons with AAV2/9-DIO-hM4D-mCherry (Figure\u00a07B). LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons were chemogenetically inhibited during light therapy (3,000 lux, 2 h/day) (Figures 7A, S11A, and S12A). Inhibition of LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons abolished the antidepressive effects of light therapy in mice that received long-term exposure to AS or CSDS (Figures 7C, S11A, and S12B). To further determine whether the vLGN/IGL-LHb pathway is required for light treatment of depressive symptoms, we injected AAV2/1-Cre into the bilateral vLGN/IGL and infected postsynaptic LHb neurons with AAV2/9-DIO-hM3D-mCherry (Figure\u00a07D). LHb postsynaptic neurons were chemogenetically activated during light therapy (Figures 7A, S11B, and S12A). We found that chemogenetic activation of LHb postsynaptic neurons also abolished the antidepressive effects of light therapy (Figures 7E, S11B, and S12C). Finally, we asked whether vLGN/IGL-projecting RGCs were required for light treatment of depressive symptoms by inhibiting vLGN/IGL-projecting RGCs during light therapy. To specifically inhibit vLGN/IGL-projecting RGCs, we delivered rAAV2/2-Retro-Cre into the bilateral vLGN/IGL and infected vLGN/IGL-projecting RGCs with AAV2/9-DIO-hM4D-mCherry through intraocular injection (Figure\u00a07F). vLGN/IGL-projecting RGCs were chemogenetically inhibited during light therapy (Figures 7A, S11C, and S12A). Inhibition of vLGN/IGL-projecting RGCs eliminated the antidepressive effects of light therapy (Figures 7G, S11C, and S12D). Thus, activation of vLGN/IGL-projecting RGCs and of the vLGN/IGL-LHb pathway is required for bright light treatment of depressive symptoms evoked by long-term exposure to AS or CSDS. Light therapy represents a cost-effective treatment for a variety of depressive conditions. Although a growing body of research supports the efficacy of light therapy for individuals with both seasonal and nonseasonal depression (, , , , , , , ), there remain many unresolved questions regarding how light therapy produces its beneficial effects. The present study offers several lines of evidence demonstrating that the retina, vLGN/IGL and LHb are crucial elements of the neural circuitry for the antidepressive effects of light therapy. The visual thalamus to habenula projection has been proposed in numerous species, including lizard, frog, mouse, rat, rabbit, and human (, , , , , , , ). With a combination of retrograde and anterograde viral transsynaptic labeling techniques, we provide direct evidence that a subset of mouse vLGN/IGL GABA neurons can directly innervate LHb CaMKIIa neurons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that selective activation of LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons inhibits LHb neurons and impairs the excitatory effects of AS on the LHb. It is well documented that LHb aberrant hyperactivity is associated with an increase in depressive-like behaviors (, , , , ). It is therefore reasonable to postulate that activation of the vLGN/IGL-LHb pathway would decrease depressive-like behaviors. This prediction was borne out by our experiments using chemogenetic methods to activate LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons or inhibit LHb postsynaptic neurons in two independent depressive-like mouse models: long-term activation of LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons or inhibition of LHb postsynaptic neurons significantly decreased depressive-like behaviors and reduced aberrant hyperactivity of LHb neurons induced by exposure to AS or CSDS. Recent studies found that increased bursting of LHb neurons caused by hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potentials drives depression, which can be induced by elevated level of astrocytic Kir4.1 in the LHb (, ). Consistent with these findings, we found that burst firing of LHb neurons was significantly increased in our depressive-like mice model, which was reduced by activation of the vLGN/IGL-LHb pathway through chemogenetic methods or light therapy. Given that most of the LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons are GABAergic, our results suggest that enhanced GABAergic synaptic inputs can reduce burst firing in the LHb. This is consistent with previous finding that burst generation in the LHb can be modulated by network synaptic inputs (). Although LHb neurons may produce rebound bursts from inhibition (, ), we did not observe increased depressive-like behaviors in animals that received light therapy and no exposure to AS (Figures 7C, 7E, and 7G). Combining this result with our finding that chemogenetic activation of the vLGN/IGL-LHb pathway or light therapy significantly decreased depressive-like behaviors and reduced burst firing in the LHb, it is highly possible that even if chemogenetic activation of the vLGN/IGL-LHb pathway or light therapy generated rebound bursts in the LHb, the depression-inducing effects evoked by rebound bursts were weak and could be overridden by the antidepressive effects caused by the reduction of overall burst firing in the LHb. Our virus-tracing data indicate that LHb postsynaptic neurons project to the DRN and VTA, which are implicated in the regulation of a broad range of mood-related behaviors, including reward-related behaviors, despair-like behaviors, and anxiety-like behaviors (, , , ). This suggests that the manipulation of the vLGN/IGL-LHb pathway can produce effects on not only depressive-like behaviors but also other mood-related behaviors. Our data support this proposal, revealing that activation of the vLGN/IGL-LHb pathway also decreased anxiety-like behaviors induced by long-term exposure to AS or CSDS. These results are strongly consistent with previous findings that optogenetic inhibition or lesion of the LHb blocked the typical anxiety-like behaviors induced by exposure to inescapable tail shock or chronic stress (, ). It is well established that mRGCs play a crucial role in the modulation of non-image-forming visual functions such as cognition, circadian rhythms, and affective behaviors (). Six (M1\u2013M6) and four (M1\u2013M4) subtypes of mRGCs have been identified in rodents and humans, respectively (, , , ). Here, we found that M4-type mRGCs can directly innervate LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons. As axon terminals of RGCs release the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate (), it is plausible that information about increased light transmitted by vLGN/IGL-projecting RGCs could alleviate depressive-like behaviors through the activation of the vLGN/IGL-LHb pathway. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrate that either the inhibition of LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons or the activation of LHb postsynaptic neurons abolishes the antidepressive effects of light therapy. A recent study found that a subset of mRGCs (predominantly M1) in mice directly innervates the perihabenular nucleus (pHb), a previously unrecognized structure of the dorsal thalamus, which unlike the LHb of the epithalamus can be activated by dark-light transitions, but not by exposure to AS (). The authors further demonstrated that chronic activation of the pHb by exposure to an ultradian light:dark cycle (T7 cycle; alternating 3.5-h periods of light and darkness) increased depressive-like behaviors (). In view of our finding that light therapy decreased the depressive-like behaviors induced by exposure to AS or CSDS through the inhibition of LHb, it appears that even if both vLGN/IGL-projecting M4-type mRGCs and pHb-projecting mRGCs were activated during daily light therapy in our depressive-like mice model, the depression-inducing effects caused by the activation of the retina-pHb pathway were negated by the antidepressive effects induced by the activation of the retina-vLGN/IGL-LHb pathway. It is also important to note that the LHb was not activated by the dark-light transition (Figures S10C and S10D). It is therefore plausible that even if both the pHb-projecting mRGCs and M4-type mRGCs were activated during the T7 cycle, the antidepressive effects induced by activation of the retina-vLGN/IGL-LHb pathway were overridden by the depression-inducing effects caused by the chronic or repeated activation of the retina-pHb pathway. In contrast to chemogenetic activation of the vLGN/IGL-LHb pathway, light therapy decreased only depressive-like behaviors and tended to increase anxiety-like behaviors, which are accompanied by the activation of the amygdala (Figures S9C and S10\u2013S12). These results are similar to a recent finding that short-term activation of mRGCs (including M4-type and non-M4-type mRGCs) tended to decrease depressive-like behaviors but increased anxiety-like behaviors and c-Fos expression in the amygdala (). The authors further demonstrated that short-term exposure to bright light also increased anxiety-like behaviors, and the anxiogenic effect of exposure to bright light was absent in mice lacking melanopsin (). Since M4-type mRGCs express melanopsin at very low levels and exhibit a weak intrinsic light response (), it is plausible that the anxiogenic effects of exposure to bright light were mainly mediated by non-M4-type mRGCs. Combined with our data that activation of the vLGN/IGL-LHb pathway decreases anxiety-like behaviors, it appears that both M4-type and non-M4-type mRGCs are activated during light therapy and that the anxiolytic effects induced by the activation of M4-type mRGCs are suppressed by the anxiogenic effects induced by the activation of non-M4-type mRGCs. Taken together, our results provide compelling evidence that light therapy can alleviate depressive-like behaviors through a dedicated subcortical neural circuit between the retina and LHb. Given the high conservation of mRGCs and visual thalamus to habenula projection in rodents and humans, these novel results may shed light on our current understanding of the mechanisms of light therapy.

All experiments were approved by the Jinan University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Adult (6-8\u00a0weeks old) male C57BL/6 mice, vGAT-Cre [STOCK Tg(Slc32a1-cre)2.1Hzo/FrkJ] mice and Opn4-Cre mice () were used in this study. Animals were housed under a 12 h:12\u00a0h light-dark cycle (lights on at 7 AM) with food and water provided ad libitum. Animals were randomly allocated to experimental and control groups. Experimenters were blind to the experimental group, and the order of testing was counterbalanced during behavioral experiments. Mice were anaesthetized (Avertin, 13\u00a0\u03bcl/g, i.p.) and placed in a stereotaxic instrument. Erythromycin eye ointment was applied to prevent corneal drying and a heat pad was used to hold body temperature at 37\u00b0C. A small craniotomy hole was made using a dental\u00a0drill (OmniDrill35, WPI, Sarasota, FL), and injections were performed via a micropipette connected to a Nanoliter Injector (NANOLITER 2010, WPI, Sarasota, FL) and its controller (Micro4, WPI, Sarasota, FL). To specifically infect vLGN/IGL GABA neurons with mCherry, AAV2/9-hSyn-DIO-mCherry was injected into the vLGN/IGL of vGAT-Cre mice (virus titers: 3-5\u00a0\u00d7 1012 particles/ml, 0.2\u00a0\u03bcl/injection; AP: \u22122.2\u00a0mm; ML:\u00a0\u00b1 2.5\u00a0mm; DV: \u22123.2\u00a0mm). To retrogradely label LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons with retrobeads, green retrobeads (Lumafluor, US, 0.05\u00a0\u03bcl/injection) was injected into the LHb of vGAT-Cre mice. To specifically infect LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons with ChR2-eYFP, mCherry, hM3D-mCherry or hM4D-mCherry, rAAV2/2-hSyn-Retro-Cre was injected into the LHb of C57BL/6 mice (virus titers: 2-4\u00a0\u00d7 1012 particles/ml; 0.1\u00a0\u03bcl/injection; AP: \u22121.6\u00a0mm; ML:\u00a0\u00b1 0.3\u00a0mm; DV: \u22123.05\u00a0mm), AAV2/9-Ef1\u03b1-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP, AAV2/9-hSyn-DIO-mCherry, AAV2/9-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry or AAV2/9-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry was injected into the vLGN/IGL (virus titers: 3-5\u00a0\u00d7 1012 particles/ml, 0.2\u00a0\u03bcl/injection). To specifically infect postsynaptic LHb neurons with eYFP, tdTomato-T2A-Synaptophysin-eGFP, mCherry, hM3D-mCherry or hM4D-mCherry, AAV2/1-hSyn-Cre (virus titers: 3-5\u00a0\u00d7 1012 particles/ml; 0.15\u00a0\u03bcl/injection) and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated Cholera Toxin Subunit B (CTB-647, 0.02\u00a0\u03bcl/injection, Invitrogen Inc., Grand Island, NY) were injected into the vLGN/IGL, and AAV2/9-Ef1\u03b1-DIO-eYFP, AAV2/9-hSyn-DIO-tdTomato-T2A-Synaptophysin-eGFP, AAV2/9-hSyn-DIO-mCherry, AAV2/9-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry or AAV2/9-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry was injected into the LHb (0.1\u00a0\u03bcl/injection). To retrogradely label DRN-projecting LHb neurons and VTA-projecting LHb neurons with retrobeads, red retrobeads was injected into the DRN and the VTA, respectively (Lumafluor, US, 0.1\u00a0\u03bcl/injection). To infect LHb CaMKII\u03b1 neurons with GCaMP6m, AAV2/5-CaMKII\u03b1-GCaMP6m was injected into the LHb (virus titers: 4.35\u00a0\u00d7 1012 particles/ml, 0.1\u00a0\u03bcl/injection). To specifically infect vLGN/IGL-projecting RGCs with mCherry, hM3D-mCherry or hM4D-mCherry, rAAV2/2-hSyn-Retro-Cre was injected into the bilateral vLGN/IGL of C57BL/6 mice (0.1\u00a0\u03bcl/injection), AAV2/9-hSyn-DIO-mCherry, AAV2/9-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry or AAV2/9-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry was injected intraocularly (1.5\u00a0\u03bcl/eye). For di-synaptic tracing of the retina\u2192vLGN/IGL\u2192LHb pathway, 0.2\u00a0\u03bcL Helper virus (AAV2/9-hSyn-EGFP-2a-TVA-2a-RVG-WPREs-pA) (virus titers: 2\u00a0\u00d7 108 particles/ml) was injected into the vLGN/IGL (10 C57BL/6 mice and 11 Opn4-Cre mice). The pipette was held in place for 10\u00a0min, and then withdrawn slowly. Twenty-one days later, 0.1\u00a0\u03bcL of SAD-\u0394G-DsRed (EnvA) (virus titers: 2\u00a0\u00d7 108 particles/ml) was injected into the LHb. To specifically infect mRGCs of Opn4-Cre mice with eYFP, AAV2/9-Ef1\u03b1-DIO-eYFP was injected intraocularly (1.5\u00a0\u03bcl/eye). Following injection, the wound was sutured, antibiotics (bacitracin and neomycin) were applied to the surgical wound and ketoprofen (5\u00a0mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously; animals were allowed to recover from anesthesia under a heat lamp. After transcardial perfusion with 0.9% saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1\u00a0M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the brain was removed and post-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4\u00b0C, and then transferred into 30% sucrose until sectioning with a cryostat (CM1900, Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL). A series of 40\u00a0\u03bcm sections was collected for verification of injection sites. Tissue sections were examined under epifluorescence using a Zeiss Axioimager Z2 microscope. For brain slice preparation, mice were deeply anaesthetized with isoflurane and coronal sections (250\u00a0\u03bcm thick) across the LHb were cut under ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF, in mM: 119 NaCl; 2.5 KCl, 1 NaH2PO4, 11 glucose, 26.2 NaHCO3, 2.5 CaCl2, and 1.3 MgCl2, at pH 7.4, 290 mOsm) using a vibratome (VT1200S; Leica Microsystems). The brain slices were recovered for \u223c1\u2009h at room temperature in ACSF. After recovery, slices were placed in the recording chamber and continuously perfused with ACSF. Evoked postsynaptic currents were elicited by 1\u00a0ms blue light stimulation of axon terminals of LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons infected with ChR2. Blue-light-evoked postsynaptic currents were recorded with Cs+-based peptide solution (in mM: 130 CsMeSO4, 10 NaCl, 10 EGTA, 4 MgATP, 0.3 Na3GTP, 10 HEPES, 290 mOsm, adjust to 7.4 with CsOH). EPSCs and IPSCs were recorded when the membrane potential was holding at \u221270\u00a0mV and 0\u00a0mV, respectively. To test whether the recorded IPSCs were mediated by GABAA receptors, 100\u00a0\u03bcM SR95531 was added to the ACSF. To test whether the recorded EPSCs were mediated by AMPA/kainate receptors, 10\u00a0\u03bcM CNQX was added to the ACSF. To test whether the postsynaptic currents recorded in LHb neurons were elicited by direct synaptic connections, 1\u00a0\u03bcM tetrodotoxin (TTX) and 100\u00a0\u03bcM 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) were added to the ACSF. The recorded cells were intracellularly filled with biocytin for morphological evaluation. To measure the excitability of LHb neurons, electrodes were filled with a K+-based solution containing (in mM) 135 KMeSO4, 10\u00a0KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 Na2-phosphocreatine, 4 MgATP, 0.3 Na3GTP, 290 mOsm, adjust to 7.4 with KOH. Depolarizing currents were applied (1\u00a0s for 50\u00a0pA and 0.15\u00a0s for 100\u00a0pA) from a membrane potential of \u221270\u2009mV. Spontaneous firing was recorded with ACSF in the electrodes. To determine the firing pattern of LHb neurons, the spontaneous neuronal activity was recorded under current-clamp at resting conditions (I\u00a0= 0\u00a0pA). LHb neurons were classified as silent, tonic or burst based on spontaneous patterns of firing (). All recordings were performed using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Traces were low-pass filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz. For light stimulation, light pulses were delivered through digital commands from the Digidata 1550A and Digital stimulator (PG4000a, Cygnus Technology). The pipette resistance was ranged from 4 to 6 M\u03a9. When stable whole-cell recordings were achieved with an access resistance below 25 M\u03a9, basic electrophysiological properties were recorded. Offline data analysis was performed using Clampfit 10.0 software (Molecular Devices). A fiber photometry system was used for recording Ca2+ signals from LHb CaMKII\u03b1 neurons. Briefly, one week after AAV2/5-CaMKII\u03b1-GCaMP6m virus injection, an optical fiber [O.D.\u00a0= 230\u00a0mm, numerical aperture (NA)\u00a0= 0.37] was placed in a ceramic ferrule and inserted toward the LHb through the craniotomy (coordinates: AP: \u22121.6\u00a0mm; ML:\u00a0\u00b1 0.35\u00a0mm; DV: \u22122.6\u00a0mm). The ceramic ferrule was supported with a skull-penetrating M1 screw and dental acrylic. Mice were individually housed and allowed to recover for at least one week. To record fluorescence signals, the laser beam from a 488-nm laser (OBIS 488LS; Coherent) was reflected by a dichroic mirror (MD498; Thorlabs), focused by a 10 x objective lens (NA\u00a0= 0.3; Olympus) and then coupled to an optical commutator (Doric Lenses). An optical fiber (O.D.\u00a0= 230\u00a0mm, NA\u00a0= 0.37, 2\u00a0m long) guided the light between the commutator and the implanted optical fiber. The laser power was adjusted at the tip of the optical fiber to a low level of 0.01 - 0.02 mW in order to minimize bleaching. The GCaMP6m fluorescence was bandpass filtered (MF525-39, Thorlabs) and collected with a photomultiplier tube (R3896, Hamamatsu). An amplifier (C7319, Hamamatsu) was used to convert the photomultiplier tube current output to voltage signals, which were further filtered through a low-pass filter (40\u00a0Hz cut-off; Brownlee 440). The analog voltage signals were digitized at 500\u00a0Hz and recorded with a Power 1401 digitizer and Spike2 software (CED, Cambridge, UK). During the recording of Ca2+ signals in mice that received the LHb injections of rAAV2/2-hSyn-Retro-Cre and vLGN/IGL injections of AAV2/9-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry, CNO and saline recordings were performed in the same animals. Specifically, 24 mice\u00a0were divided into 4 groups: foot shock (n\u00a0= 6 animals), air puff (n\u00a0= 6 animals), fox urine (n\u00a0= 6 animals), and physical restraint (n\u00a0= 6 animals). The mice in each group received an i.p. injection of CNO, followed by saline 24\u00a0h later. To test whether exposure to bright light attenuates the activation of LHb excitatory neurons, we used fiber photometry to record the AS (foot shock, air puff, fox urine, physical restraint) evoked Ca2+ signals in LHb CaMKII\u03b1 neurons expressing GCaMP6m with/without exposure to bright light (3000 Lux). With and without exposure to bright light recordings were performed in the same animals. Specifically, AS-evoked Ca2+ signals were first recorded under bright light conditions (3000 lux). Twenty-four hours later, AS-evoked Ca2+ signals were recorded again under room light conditions (120 lux). All animals were anaesthetized (Avertin, 13\u00a0\u03bcl/g, i.p.) and perfused intracardially with 0.9% saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains and eyes were removed. For CaMKII\u03b1 labeling, cryostat sections containing the LHb were placed in 0.1\u00a0M PBS containing 10% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and 0.3% Triton X-100 (T8787, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) for 1\u00a0h before incubation in primary antibody against CaMKII\u03b1 (rabbit, 1:500; ab5683, Abcam) (36\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C). Sections were then incubated with the corresponding secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:400 for 6\u00a0h at room temperature: (DyLight 594) goat-anti-rabbit IgG (DI-1594, Vector Laboratories). For detection of biocytin-filled LHb neurons, cryostat sections containing the LHb were placed in 0.1\u00a0M PBS containing 10% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and 0.3% Triton X-100 (T8787, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) for 1\u00a0h before incubation in Streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 647 (1:100, S21374, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 48\u00a0h at 4\u00b0C. For c-Fos labeling, procedures used in CaMKII\u03b1 labeling were adopted except that the primary antibody was replaced with antibody against c-Fos (rabbit, 1:500, 2250, Cell Signaling Technology), and the secondary antibody was replaced with goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (1:400, 111-545-003, Jackson ImmunoResearch). For detection of SMI-32-immunoreactive RGCs, retinas were isolated and washed in 0.1\u00a0M PBS 3 times (10\u00a0min each) before incubation in 0.1\u00a0M PBS containing 10% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and 0.3% Triton X-100 (T8787, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) for 1 h. Then retinas were incubated for 3\u00a0days at 4\u00b0C with a mouse anti-SMI-32 antibody (1:1000, 801703, Biolegend). This was followed by 6 rinses in 0.1\u00a0M PBS and then incubation with a secondary (DyLight 594) goat-anti-mouse\u00a0IgG (1:400, 35510, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 6\u00a0h at room temperature. Finally, all sections and retinas were rinsed in 0.1\u00a0M PBS and coverslipped in anti-fading aqueous mounting medium with DAPI (EMS, Hatfield, PA). Retinas and sections were imaged with a Zeiss 700 confocal microscope with 5x or 20x objectives or a 40x oil immersion objective. For three-dimensional reconstruction of injected or virus-labeled cells, optical sections were collected at 0.2\u00a0\u03bcm intervals. Each stack of optical sections covered a retinal area of 325.75\u00a0\u00d7 325.75\u00a0mm2 (1024\u00a0\u00d7 1024 pixels). Using ImageJ and Photoshop CS5 (Adobe Corp., San Jose, California, USA), each stack of optical sections was montaged and projected to a 0\u00b0 X-Y plane and a 90\u00b0 Y-Z plane to obtain a three-dimensional reconstruction of the cell. Contrast and brightness were adjusted, and the red-green images were converted to magenta-green. For each rabies virus-labeled RGC, the total sizes of the soma and dendritic field were analyzed. Dendritic field area was calculated by drawing a convex polygon linking the dendritic terminals. The dendritic field area was then calculated, and the diameter was calculated as that of a circle having an equal area. All behavioral tests were conducted during the light phase (7 AM \u2013 7 PM). Operators were blinded to the experimental group during the scoring. Mice were placed into an acrylic box (25\u00a0cm \u00d7 25\u00a0cm \u00d7 40\u00a0cm) equipped with a metal grid floor. To record foot shock evoked Ca2+ signals in LHb CaMKII\u03b1 neurons, foot shocks (1 mA, 500\u00a0ms) were delivered with inter-trial intervals of 15 s. Shock delivery onset was used as the trigger event for data alignment. To establish a depressive-like mouse model, foot shocks (20 times/day, 1 mA, 500\u00a0ms) were randomly delivered with inter-trial intervals of 15, 20 or 30 s. For the control group, mice were placed in the same acrylic box but did not receive foot shock stimulation. To record air puff-evoked Ca2+ signals in LHb CaMKII\u03b1 neurons, the body of the mouse was inserted into an acrylic \u2018body tube\u2019, with the mouse`s head extending out. A brief air puff was delivered to the face of the mouse by pressing a hand-pump air compressor (13\u00a0\u00d7 5\u00a0cm) attached to a PVC tube with its opening positioned \u223c5\u00a0cm away from the mouse`s nostril. One press of the hand pump generates a \u223c2 s-long gentle air puff. Air puffs were delivered with inter-trial intervals of \u223c15 s. Onset of air puff delivery was used as the trigger event for data alignment. To establish a depressive-like mouse model, mice were placed in their home cages, and air puffs (20 times/day) were randomly delivered to the faces of the mice with inter-trial intervals of 10-15 s. To record fox urine-evoked Ca2+ signals in LHb CaMKII\u03b1 neurons, the body of the mouse was inserted into an acrylic \u2018body tube\u2019, with the head extending out. A cotton ball soaked with red fox urine (2\u00a0mL of Red fox P; Timk\u2019s, Safariland Hunting Corp., Trappe, MA) was placed \u223c1\u00a0cm away from the nostril of the mouse. To establish a depressive-like mouse model, mice were kept in a transparent plastic container (25\u00a0cm \u00d7 10\u00a0cm \u00d7 10\u00a0cm, with holes) containing 4 cotton balls soaked with red fox urine\u2014for 30\u00a0min/day. For the control group, instead of fox urine, we added 2\u00a0mL of water. To record physical restraint-evoked Ca2+ signals in LHb CaMKII\u03b1 neurons, a well-trained experimenter restrained the mouse for \u223c5\u00a0s by placing gentle pressure on the mouse body with the left hand and immobilizing the tail with the right hand. To establish a depressive-like mouse model, the mice were restrained for 1 h/day in a plastic restrainer. After restraint treatment, the mice were returned to their own cages. This experiment was started 1\u00a0h after the onset of the light phase and continued for 2\u00a0h (8 AM-10 AM). Mice were kept in their home cages which were placed in a custom-designed light therapy cabinet (30 cages/cabinet). Full spectrum bright light was supplied by cool LED lights (UV-free) and the intensity was determined by averaging the measurements from the top and the four sides of the cage. Following 14\u00a0days/10\u00a0days of treatment all animals underwent behavioral tests as detailed below. Mice were tested for preference for a 2% sucrose solution (Sucrose, Sigma-Aldrich) using a two-bottle choice procedure. Each animal was housed individually during the 2-day test period. Animals were given two bottles, one of sucrose and one of tap water. Every 24 h, the amounts of sucrose and water consumed were recorded. To prevent potential location preference for drinking, the positions of the bottles were changed every 24 h. Food and water were available ad libitum prior to the SPT. The preference for the sucrose solution was determined as the percentage of sucrose solution ingested relative to the total intake. Mice were placed in a cylinder of water (temperature of 23 \u2013 25\u00b0C; 20\u00a0cm in diameter, 27\u00a0cm in height for mice) for 6\u00a0min. The depth of water was set to prevent animals from touching the bottom with their hind limbs. Animal behavior was video-tracked from the side. The time each animal spent immobile during the test was counted online by two independent observers in a blinded manner. Immobility was defined as no active movement except that needed to keep the animal from drowning. Mice were placed into a shuttle box (15\u00a0cm length \u00d7 24\u00a0cm width \u00d7 20\u00a0cm height) equipped with a metal grid floor and a door separating the two compartments. During the test, mice were administered 30 0.1-0.3 mA foot shocks for 10\u00a0s (30\u00a0s inter-trial interval). The foot shock terminated any time that the mice fled into the other compartment. Failure is defined as the absence of fleeing into the other compartment within the 10\u00a0s foot shock delivery. Motor activity was measured in an open field test box (50\u00a0cm length \u00d7 50\u00a0cm width \u00d7 40\u00a0cm height). Mice were placed in the center of a plastic box in a room with dim light and were allowed to explore the arena for 15\u00a0min. All animal activity was recorded with an infrared camera placed above the box. Locomotion and time spent in the center during the last 10\u00a0min was measured (Ethovision XT software). The box was wiped clean with a paper towel soaked in 50% ethanol and dried thoroughly after each test session. The apparatus for the EPM consisted of two opposing open arms (44\u00a0cm length \u00d7 12\u00a0cm width) and two closed arms (44\u00a0cm length \u00d7 12\u00a0cm width), which were connected by a central zone (12\u00a0cm length \u00d7 12\u00a0cm width). The whole apparatus was elevated 50\u00a0cm above the floor. The mouse was placed in the center zone facing toward one open arm and was allowed to freely explore the arena during a 6\u00a0min test session. Time spent in the open arm during the last 4\u00a0min was measured (Ethovision XT software). The box was wiped clean with a paper towel soaked in 50% ethanol and dried thoroughly after each test session. Food pellets were removed from the home cage for 24\u00a0h before testing (with ad libitum access to water). For testing, mice were placed in a corner of an unfamiliar white Plexiglas arena (50\u00a0cm length \u00d7 50\u00a0cm width \u00d7 40\u00a0cm height) with the floor covered in corn cob bedding under bright light conditions (\u223c550 lux). A single food pellet placed on white filter paper (9\u00a0cm diameter) was prepositioned in the middle of the arena. The latency to eat was measured with a stopwatch and defined based on the first bite of the food pellet. The maximum time allowed was set at 10\u00a0min. Retired male breeder CD-1 mice were screened for aggressive behavior for 3 consecutive days and housed in the social defeat cage (26\u00a0cm width \u00d7 45\u00a0cm depth \u00d7 16\u00a0cm height) 24\u00a0h before the start of defeats on one side of a clear perforated Plexiglas divider (0.5\u00a0cm width \u00d7 43\u00a0cm depth \u00d7 16\u00a0cm height). C57BL/6 mice were subjected to physical interactions with an unfamiliar, aggressive CD-1 mouse for 10\u00a0min/day over 10 consecutive days. After interactions, C57BL/6 mice were removed and housed on the opposite side of the divider over the subsequent 24\u00a0h period. In the control group, C57BL/6 mice were housed two per cage on either side of a perforated divider and rotated daily in a similar manner without being exposed to the CD-1 mice. Experimental mice were singly housed after the last bout of physical interaction and the social interaction test was conducted 24\u00a0h later. Mice were first placed in an open arena (42\u00a0cm length \u00d7 42\u00a0cm width \u00d7 40\u00a0cm height) with an empty half-cylindrical metal cage (bottom diameter: 10\u00a0cm, height: 16\u00a0cm). Movements were recorded automatically for 2.5\u00a0min with a tracking system (Ethovision XT). Time spent in the area surrounding the cage (interaction zone, 8\u00a0cm region flanking cage) and in the area along the wall opposite to the cage (opposing zone, 9\u00a0cm region along wall opposing cage) was measured. Mice were then returned to the home cage for 30 s. Finally, a novel, aggressive CD1 mouse was placed in the cage and the same metrics were measured. The SI ratio was calculated by dividing the time spent in the interaction zone with CD1 mice divided by the time spent in the interaction zone without CD1 mice. The designer drug CNO (2\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.; C0832, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) was administrated 30\u00a0min before exposure to aversive stimuli (Figures 2E, 3A, and 5C) or social defeat stress (Figure\u00a0S6A) or light therapy (7:30 AM, Figures 7A and S12A). For Figures 5D, S5A, S7A, CNO (2\u00a0mg/kg, i.p) was administrated between 10 AM \u2013 10:30 AM. Fiber photometry recording data were exported as MATLAB. Mat files from Spike2 software for further analysis. All raw data were smoothed with a moving average filter (20\u00a0ms span) and then segmented and aligned according to the onset of behavioral events within individual trials or bouts. The fluorescence change (\u0394F/F) values were calculated as (F\u2212F0)/F0, where F0 is the baseline fluorescence signal averaged over a 1.5 s-long control time window (typically set 0.5 s) prior to a trigger event. \u0394F/F values are presented as heatmaps or as average plots with a shaded area indicating the SEM. A multivariate permutation test was used to analyze the statistical significance of the event-related fluorescence change (ERF). Then, 1,000 permutations for an a-level of 0.05 were used to compare the values of \u0394F/F at each time point with the ERF baseline values. To quantify the percentage of RV-DsRed-labeled RGCs co-labeled with SMI-32 (Figure\u00a04E), 4 C57BL/6 mice received vLGN/IGL injection of helper virus and LHb injection of SAD-\u0394G-DsRed (EnvA) were used. In each mouse, the numbers of RV-DsRed-labeled RGCs and RV-DsRed/SMI-32 double-labeled RGCs were counted in the contralateral retina. The percentage of RV-DsRed/SMI-32 double-labeled RGCs was calculated as the percentage of the total number of RV-DsRed/SMI-32 double-labeled RGCs counted in 4 mice within the total number of RV-DsRed-labeled RGCs counted in 4 mice. To quantify the percentage of RV-DsRed-labeled RGCs co-labeled with eYFP (Figure\u00a04F), 3 Opn4-Cre mice received vLGN/IGL injection of helper virus, LHb injection of SAD-\u0394G-DsRed (EnvA), and intraocular injection of AAV2/9-Ef1\u03b1-DIO-eYFP were used. In each mouse, the numbers of RV-DsRed-labeled RGCs and RV-DsRed/eYFP double-labeled RGCs were counted in the contralateral retina. The percentage of RV-DsRed/eYFP double-labeled RGCs was calculated as the percentage of the total number of RV-DsRed/eYFP double-labeled RGCs counted in 3 mice within the total number of RV-DsRed-labeled RGCs counted in 3 mice. To quantify the percentage of LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons co-labeled with retrobeads and mCherry (Figure\u00a0S1A), 3 vGAT-Cre mice received vLGN/IGL injection of AAV2/9-hSyn-DIO-mCherry and LHb injection of green retrobeads were used. In each mouse, the numbers of retrobeads-labeled neurons and retrobeads/mCherry double-labeled neurons were counted in 4 consecutive brain sections (40\u00a0\u03bcm/section) across the vLGN/IGL. The percentage of retrobeads/mCherry double-labeled neurons was calculated as the percentage of the total number of retrobeads/mCherry double-labeled neurons counted in 3 mice within the total number of retrobeads-labeled neurons counted in 3 mice. To quantify the percentage of LHb postsynaptic neurons co-labeled with eYFP and CaMKII\u03b1 (Figure\u00a0S1B), 4 C57BL/6 mice received vLGN/IGL injection of AAV2/1-hSyn-Cre and LHb injection of AAV2/9-Ef1\u03b1-DIO-eYFP were used. In each mouse, the numbers of eYFP-labeled neurons and eYFP/CaMKII\u03b1 double-labeled neurons were counted in 4 consecutive brain sections (40\u00a0\u03bcm/section) across the LHb. The percentage of eYFP/CaMKII\u03b1 double-labeled neurons was calculated as the percentage of the total number of eYFP/CaMKII\u03b1 double-labeled neurons counted in 4 mice within the total number of eYFP-labeled neurons counted in 4 mice. To quantify the percentage of LHb postsynaptic neurons co-labeled with eYFP and red retrobeads (Figures S2H and S2L), 6 C57BL/6 mice received vLGN/IGL injection of AAV2/1-hSyn-Cre, LHb injection of AAV2/9-Ef1\u03b1-DIO-eYFP, and DRN (n\u00a0= 3 mice) or VTA (n\u00a0= 3 mice) injection of red retrobeads were used. In each mouse, the numbers of eYFP-labeled neurons and eYFP/retrobeads double-labeled neurons were counted in 4 consecutive brain sections (40\u00a0\u03bcm/section) across the LHb. The percentage of eYFP/retrobeads double-labeled neurons was calculated as the percentage of the total number of eYFP/retrobeads double-labeled neurons counted in 3 mice within the total number of eYFP-labeled neurons counted in 3 mice. To quantify the numbers of starter cells in the vLGN/IGL and RV-DsRed-labeled presynaptic RGCs in the retina (Figure\u00a0S8B), 6 C57BL/6 mice received vLGN/IGL injection of helper virus and LHb injection of SAD-\u0394G-DsRed (EnvA) were used. In each mouse, the numbers of helper virus/RV-DsRed double-labeled starter cells from 4 consecutive brain sections (40\u00a0\u03bcm/section) across the vLGN/IGL, and RV-DsRed-labeled RGCs from the contralateral retina were counted. The average number of starter cells in the vLGN/IGL and RV-DsRed-labeled presynaptic RGCs in the retina was calculated as the total number of starter cells and presynaptic RGCs counted in 6 animals divided by the number of animals. To quantify the influence of chemogenetic activation of LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons on c-Fos expression (Figure\u00a02B), 12 C57BL/6 mice that received LHb injection of rAAV2/2-hSyn-Retro-Cre and vLGN/IGL injection of AAV2/9-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry were divided into 2 groups: 1) Saline, 6 mice received i.p. injection of saline, followed by a 30\u00a0min interval and then received light deprivation (2 h); 2) CNO, 6 mice received i.p. injection of CNO, followed by a 30\u00a0min interval and then received light deprivation (2\u00a0h). All animals were anaesthetized and perfused. Brain slices across the vLGN/IGL were subjected to immunostaining for c-Fos. In\u00a0each mouse, the numbers of hM3D-labeled neurons and c-Fos/hM3D double-labeled neurons were counted from 4 consecutive brain sections (40\u00a0\u03bcm/section) across the vLGN/IGL. The percentage of c-Fos/hM3D double-labeled neurons in each group was calculated as the percentage of the total number of c-Fos/hM3D double-labeled neurons counted in 6 mice within the total number of hM3D-labeled neurons counted in 6 mice. To quantify the influence of chemogenetic activation of vLGN/IGL-projecting RGCs on c-Fos expression (Figure\u00a05B), 10 C57BL/6 mice that received vLGN/IGL injection of rAAV2/2-hSyn-Retro-Cre and intraocular injection of AAV2/9-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry were divided into 2 groups: 1) Saline, 5 mice received i.p. injection of saline, followed by a 30\u00a0min interval and then received light deprivation (2 h); 2) CNO, 5 mice received i.p. injection of CNO, followed by a 30\u00a0min interval and then received light deprivation (2\u00a0h). All animals were anaesthetized and perfused. Retinas were subjected to immunostaining for c-Fos. In each mouse, the numbers of hM3D-labeled RGCs and c-Fos/hM3D double-labeled RGCs were counted. The percentage of c-Fos/hM3D double-labeled RGCs in each group was calculated as the percentage of the total number of c-Fos/hM3D double-labeled RGCs counted in 5 mice within the total number of hM3D-labeled RGCs counted in 5 mice. To quantify the influence of chemogenetic inhibition of LHb postsynaptic neurons on c-Fos expression (Figure\u00a0S4C), 12 C57BL/6 mice that received vLGN/IGL injection of AAV2/1-hSyn-Cre and LHb injection of AAV2/9-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry were divided into 2 groups: 1) Saline-AS, 6 mice received i.p. injection of saline, followed by a 30\u00a0min interval and then exposure to foot shock (1\u00a0mA, 500\u00a0ms); 2) CNO-AS, 6 mice received i.p. injection of CNO, followed by a 30\u00a0min interval and then exposure to foot shock (1 mA, 500\u00a0ms). After a 2\u00a0h interval, all animals were anaesthetized and perfused. Brain slices across the LHb were subjected to immunostaining for c-Fos. In each mouse, the numbers of hM4D-labeled neurons and c-Fos/hM4D double-labeled neurons were counted from 4 consecutive brain sections (40\u00a0\u03bcm/section) across the LHb. The percentage of c-Fos/hM4D double-labeled neurons in each group was calculated as the percentage of the total number of c-Fos/hM4D double-labeled neurons counted in 6 mice within the total number of hM4D-labeled neurons counted in 6 mice. To quantify the influence of acute light exposure on c-Fos expression in the vLGN/IGL, LHb, periaqueductal gray (PAG) and amygdala (Figures S10C and S10D), 16 C57BL/6 mice were divided into 4 groups: 1) RL, 4 mice exposed to room light (7 AM \u2013 11 AM, 120\u00a0lux); 2) RL+LT, 4 mice that first exposed to room light (7 AM \u2013 9 AM) and then exposed to light therapy (9 AM \u2013 11 AM, 3000\u00a0lux); 3) Dark, 4 mice received light deprivation (7 AM \u2013 11 AM); 4) Dark+LT, 4 mice that first received light deprivation (7\u00a0AM\u00a0\u2013 9 AM) and then exposed to light therapy (9 AM \u2013 11 AM, 3000 lux). All animals were anaesthetized and perfused. Brain slices across the vLGN/IGL, LHb, PAG and amygdala were subjected to immunostaining for c-Fos. In each mouse, the numbers of c-Fos+ cells were counted from 4 consecutive brain sections (40\u00a0\u03bcm/section) across the vLGN/IGL, LHb, PAG and amygdala, respectively. The average number of c-Fos+ cells in the vLGN/IGL, LHb, PAG and amygdala (basolateral amygdala and central amygdala) was calculated as the total number of c-Fos+ cells counted in 4 animals divided by the number of animals. To quantify the influence of chemogenetic inhibiton of LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons on c-Fos expression (Figure\u00a0S11A), 18 C57BL/6 mice that received LHb injection of rAAV2/2-hSyn-Retro-Cre and vLGN/IGL injection of AAV2/9-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry were divided into 3 groups: 1) D-Saline, 6 mice received i.p. injection of saline and light deprivation (2 h); 2) LT-Saline, 6 mice received i.p. injection of saline and light therapy (3000 lux, 2 h); 3) LT-CNO, 6 mice received i.p. injection of CNO and light therapy (3000 lux, 2 h). All animals were anaesthetized and perfused. Brain slices across the vLGN/IGL were subjected to immunostaining for c-Fos. In each mouse, the numbers of hM4D-labeled neurons and c-Fos/hM4D double-labeled neurons were counted from 4 consecutive brain sections (40\u00a0\u03bcm/section) across the vLGN/IGL. The percentage of c-Fos/hM4D double-labeled neurons in each group was calculated as the percentage of the total number of c-Fos/hM4D double-labeled neurons counted in 6 mice within the total number of hM4D-labeled neurons counted in 6 mice. To quantify the influence of chemogenetic activation of LHb postsynaptic neurons on c-Fos expression (Figure\u00a0S11B), 18 C57BL/6 mice that received vLGN/IGL injection of AAV2/1-hSyn-Cre and LHb injection of AAV2/9-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry were divided into 3 groups: 1) D-Saline, 6 mice received i.p. injection of saline and light deprivation (2 h); 2) D-CNO, 6 mice received i.p. injection of CNO and light deprivation (2 h); 3) LT-CNO, 6 mice received i.p. injection of CNO and light therapy (3000 lux, 2 h). All animals were anaesthetized and perfused. Brain slices across the LHb were subjected to immunostaining for c-Fos. In each mouse, the number of hM3D-labeled neurons and c-Fos/hM3D double-labeled neurons were counted from 4 consecutive brain sections (40\u00a0\u03bcm/section) across the LHb. The percentage of c-Fos/hM3D double-labeled neurons in each group was calculated as the percentage of the total number of c-Fos/hM3D double-labeled neurons counted in 6 mice within the total number of hM3D-labeled neurons counted in 6 mice. To quantify the influence of chemogenetic inhibition of vLGN/IGL-projecting RGCs on c-Fos expression (Figure\u00a0S11C), 18 C57BL/6 mice that received vLGN/IGL injection of rAAV2/2-hSyn-Retro-Cre and intraocular injection of AAV2/9-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry were divided into 3 groups: 1) D-Saline, 6 mice received i.p. injection of saline and light deprivation (2 h); 2) LT-Saline, 6 mice received i.p. injection of saline and light therapy (3000 lux, 2 h); 3) LT-CNO, 6 mice received i.p. injection of CNO and light therapy (3000 lux, 2\u00a0h). All animals were anaesthetized and perfused. Retinas were subjected to immunostaining for c-Fos. In each mouse, the numbers of hM4D-labeled RGCs and c-Fos/hM4D double-labeled RGCs were counted. The percentage of c-Fos/hM4D double-labeled RGCs in each group was calculated as the percentage of the total number of c-Fos/hM4D double-labeled RGCs counted in 6 mice within the total number of hM4D-labeled RGCs counted in 6 mice. All statistics were calculated using GraphPad Prism 7 software. Data analysis was performed by experimenters blind to experimental conditions.

This commonality suggests that SF inactivation is an ancient process arising from the shared VGIC pore architecture.  Voltage-gated calcium channels (CaVs) are multisubunit, macromolecular complexes that control cellular calcium entry in response to membrane potential changes in the brain, nervous system, and heart (, ). Due to the central role of calcium in cellular signaling () and the importance of CaVs as sources of Ca2+ influx that impact synaptic transmission, hormone release, vascular tone, muscle contraction, and gene expression (, , ), a multifaceted set of activity-dependent feedback regulation mechanisms shape CaV function. Chief among these is calcium-dependent inactivation (CDI), a process by which Ca2+ influx through CaV1 and CaV2 channels causes a cessation of ion conduction (, , , ). Perturbations in CDI are involved in autism (), blindness (), and cardiac arrhythmias (, , , , , , , ), demonstrating that CDI is an important factor in diseases linked to CaV dysfunction. The CaV pore-forming CaV\u03b11 subunit is a 24 transmembrane segment protein comprising four repeats (DI\u2013DIV) that are each made from six transmembrane helices that form the voltage sensor domain (SI\u2013S4) and the pore domain (S5\u2013S6) (, , ). CaV\u03b11 shares the overall architecture found throughout the voltage-gated ion channel (VGIC) superfamily but requires auxiliary subunits for proper function (, ). Complexes with two intracellular components that bind to the cytosolic I-II loop and C-terminal tail, the CaV\u03b2 subunit (, , ) and calmodulin (CaM) (, , , , ), respectively, are particularly important for activity-dependent feedback modulation by the two principal CaV inactivation mechanisms, voltage-dependent inactivation (VDI) (, ) and CDI (, , , ). The molecular origins of CDI have been extensively investigated, especially from the vantage point of the intracellular, CaM-based sensor apparatus and the role of the CaM-binding IQ domain (, , , , , , ). Although the involvement of this CaM-based sensor in CDI is clear (, , , , , , , , ), the fact that the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain (, , , ) and the CaV\u03b2/I-II loop complex (, ) also impact CDI has left open the question of how conformational changes in these cytoplasmic parts of the channel complex terminate Ca2+ influx (, , , , , ). The prevailing model suggests that the activation gate formed by the S6 helices of the channel pore acts as the CDI endpoint via an allosteric mechanism (, , ). Other studies have raised the idea of a close link between ion selectivity and CDI, based on the fact that CDI and selectivity properties are simultaneously affected by SF mutations or changes in extracellular Ca2+ concentrations (, ) and on the observation that SF Gd3+ block appears mutually exclusive with inactivation (). Further, the extent to which CDI and VDI share common pathways (, , ) or act by different mechanisms (, ) has been unclear. We discovered that mutations in the conserved aspartate at the CaV1.2 domain II (DII) SF (+1) position, a site that is important for CaV SF Ca2+ binding and that forms an outer ion binding site in bacterial voltage-gated sodium channels (BacNaVs) and mammalian CaVs (), affect CDI. Mutation of this conserved aspartate can effectively eliminate CDI in CaV1.2, while sparing core biophysical properties including voltage-dependent activation, VDI, and ion selectivity. Analogous SF DII (+1) mutations in two other CaVs, a CaV1.3 variant bearing the most robust CDI among all CaVs (, , ) and CaV2.1, a channel in which CDI relies on a different CaM lobe than in CaV1\u00a0s (, , , ), demonstrate that the role of the DII (+1) aspartate in controlling CDI is both conserved and independent of the details of how the intracellular Ca2+ sensor acts. We also show that, in channels lacking CDI because the DII (+1) aspartate is mutated, one can restore CDI by placing an aspartate at the analogous SF (+1) sites of DIII or DIV but not DI. This observation is concordant with asymmetric functional roles for the four glutamates at the SF (0) position (, , ) and indicates that the change in the SF that drives CDI is asymmetric. Together, our data establish that the CaV SF is the endpoint gate for CDI and change the paradigm for understanding CaV inactivation mechanisms by placing it squarely within the framework of the growing list of VGIC superfamily members in which SF-based gating is central to function (, , , , , , , , , , , , , , ). These findings support the idea that SF inactivation is an ancient process arising from the conserved VGIC pore architecture () that not only affects slow inactivation, but also controls CDI in CaVs. The SF sequences of each of the four CaV domains are highly similar to each other and to those found in BacNaVs (, , , , ), which are thought to be a common ancestor of both voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVs) and CaVs (, , ). All share the central glutamate residue (denoted position (0); , ) (Figure\u00a01A) and a common architecture that supports the SF structure (Figure\u00a01B) (, , ). The SF (0) position glutamates form a charged ring at the center of the CaV and BacNaV SFs (, , , )\u00a0and play a key role in Ca2+ selectivity and ion permeation (, ). In the case of CaVs, the four SF sequences are not identical. Further, even though the side-chain identity at the CaV SF position (0) is the same, each (0) position glutamate contributes differently to SF properties with the DIII (0) glutamate (CaV1.2 Glu 1115) being the most important contributor to ion selectivity (, , , ). A\u00a0further asymmetry in the CaV SF occurs at DII position (+1). This site has a unique aspartate (CaV1.2 Asp 707) (Figure\u00a01A) that is involved in the high-affinity binding of Ca2+ to the SF and whose neutralization by mutation has similar effects on Ca2+ binding as neutralization of the DIII position (0) glutamate (). In the course of studying the functional properties of CaV1.2 SF mutants using two-electrode-voltage clamp of Xenopus oocytes (Figure\u00a0S1A), we observed that replacement of the DII (+1) site, Asp 707, with alanine, glycine, asparagine, or glutamate decreased CDI. These effects manifested as varied degrees of reduction of the classic \u201cU-shaped\u201d response characteristic of CDI with D707A and D707N causing the greatest and mildest effects, respectively (Figures 1C and 1D). To quantify changes in CDI, we measured the ratio between the current amplitude at the peak and 300\u00a0ms post-depolarization (R300) for both Ba2+ and Ca2+ as a function of voltage (Figure\u00a01D) and compared the difference between Ba2+ and Ca2+ R300 values, f, for CaV1.2 and D707A/G/N/E mutants at the potential of maximal current,\u00a0+20\u00a0mV (). This analysis revealed a rank order of D > N > E > G > A (f\u00a0= 0.61\u00a0\u00b1 0.02, 0.49\u00a0\u00b1 0.04, 0.35\u00a0\u00b1 0.02, 0.24\u00a0\u00b1 0.03, and 0.10\u00a0\u00b1 0.01, respectively; Table 1), suggesting the importance of both the negative charge and the DII (+1) position side-chain geometry for CDI. The stronger CDI observed in D707N versus D707E indicates that other side-chain properties at the DII (+1) besides the negative charge are important for CDI. Experiments using a domain III position (0) mutant that reduces Ca2+ ion selectivity, E1115A (, ), also caused a large reduction in CDI (f\u00a0= 0.14\u00a0\u00b1 0.02) that was comparable to the Asp 707 mutant causing the most severe CDI reduction, D707A (Figures 1C\u20131E). None of the SF mutants that we tested affected voltage-dependent activation (Figure\u00a01F). Consistent with its ability to reduce Ca2+ selectivity (, ), the E1115A mutant caused a shift in the reversal potential for Ca2+ relative to wild-type (Erev\u00a0= 89.1\u00a0\u00b1 4.0\u00a0mV and 49.8\u00a0\u00b1 1.0\u00a0mV for CaV1.2 and E1115A, respectively) (Figure\u00a01G). Such a change in Erev was notably absent from the Asp 707 mutants, all of which behaved similarly to wild-type (Erev\u00a0= 92.8\u00a0\u00b1 4.8, 94.8\u00a0\u00b1 4.0, 87.8\u00a0\u00b1 2.5, and 88.0\u00a0\u00b1 8.1\u00a0mV for D707A, D707G, D707N, and D707E, respectively) (Figure\u00a01G). E1115A reduced the ratio between Ba2+ and Ca2+ peak currents (IBa/ICa) to a value close to one, indicating that this mutation renders the SF unable to discriminate between Ba2+ and Ca2+, and consistent with a change in ion selectivity. By contrast, the ability to discriminate between Ba2+ and Ca2+ was preserved in all Asp 707 mutants, as IBa/ICa was either unaffected (D707A, D707G) or increased (D707N, D707E) (Figure\u00a0S2A). Moreover, switching the CaV\u03b2 subunit to CaV\u03b23, a subunit that allows fast VDI (, ) did not alter the relative impact of the Asp 707 mutations on CDI, a result demonstrating that SF mutation effects on CDI are independent of CaV\u03b2 (Figure\u00a0S3). Overall, these observations indicate that Asp 707 mutations affect CDI but leave other biophysical properties unchanged. f is defined as R300 for Ba2+ \u2013 R300 for Ca2+ where R300\u00a0= I300/I0 where I300 and I0 are current amplitudes at 300\u00a0ms post-depolarization and at the peak current, respectively. f\u2032 is defined as R800 for Ba2+ \u2013 R800 for Ca2+ where R800\u00a0= I800/I0 where I800 and I0 are current amplitudes at 800\u00a0ms post-depolarization and at the peak current, respectively. f and f\u2032 were determined at membrane potential of\u00a0+20 and\u00a0+10\u00a0mV, respectively. IBa/ICa is the Ba2+ and Ca2+ peak current amplitude ratio. Erev is the reversal potential. V1/2 is the midpoint of activation. k is the slope factor of the activation curve. Erev, V1/2, and k were determined using Ca2+ as the charge carrier. n is the number of experiments. Data were fit to I\u00a0= Gmax \u2217 (Vm \u2212 Erev)/(1\u00a0+ exp (V1/2 \u2212 Vm)/k), where I is the measured peak current at each test potential (Vm) and Gmax is the maximal macroscopic conductance. Data are expressed as mean values\u00a0\u00b1 SEM. CaVs have two principal inactivation mechanisms, CDI (, , ) and VDI (, ). Due to the strong slowing effects that CaV\u03b22a has on VDI (, , ), VDI is largely absent in our initial experiments that uncovered the importance of the DII (+1) site in CDI (Figures 1C and 1D). Therefore, to examine the possible impact of changes at the DII (+1) SF position on VDI, we paired CaV1.2 channels bearing a set of DII (+1) mutations that had differing effects on CDI (D707A, D707E, and D707N) with the CaV\u03b2 isoform that imparts the fastest VDI, CaV\u03b23 (, ), and measured the effects on VDI kinetics using Ba2+ as the charge carrier. These experiments showed that regardless of whether the DII (+1) SF mutant caused a strong (D707A), intermediate (D707E), or mild (D707N) effect on CDI, none caused changes in VDI (Figures 1C, 1D, S4A, and S4B). Mutations at the SF (+4) site on the extracellular side of the pore above the SF (+1) and (0) positions (Figure\u00a01B) affect inactivation in BacNaVs (), bacterial channels sharing both structural and functional properties with CaVs and NaVs (, ). To ask whether mutations at the three homologous CaV1.2 SF (+4) positions bearing charged residues, DI Asp 367, DIII Glu 1119, and DIV Asp 1420 (Figure\u00a01A), could affect CaV inactivation, we measured the effect of alanine mutations at each of these sites in CaV1.2 co-expressed with CaV\u03b23. Two of the three mutations, DIII (+4) E1119A and DIV (+4) D1420A, reduced both the rate and the extent of VDI. By contrast, DI (+4) D367A had no effect on VDI (Figures S4C and S4D). Interestingly, despite the clear effects of DIII (+4) E1119A and DIV (+4) D1420A on VDI, these mutations left CDI and other biophysical properties completely intact (Figure\u00a0S5). These experiments demonstrate that removal of the conserved negative charges at two different levels of the SF architecture yields two distinct phenotypic outcomes. Removal of the negative charge at DII (+1) blunts CDI but spares VDI, whereas removal of the negative charge at DIII (+4) or DIV (+4) leaves CDI intact but reduces VDI. These results support the general idea that inactivation mechanisms are set by the shared nature of the pore domain architecture across diverse VGICs (). The ability of the DII (+1) mutants to blunt CDI but spare VDI and other biophysical properties differs from the consequences of cytoplasmic domain mutations that affect CDI but that also impact coupling to the CaV\u03b2 subunit and VDI (), and S6 mutations that affect CDI but that also affect VDI and activation voltage dependency (, ). Together, our observations suggest that the SF is an essential element in the CDI mechanism. Our observations suggest two possible mechanisms by which the DII (+1) and DIII (0) SF mutants could diminish CDI. The first, consistent with the effects of the DIII (0) mutant E1115A, is that mutations at some SF sites cause ion selectivity changes that reduce Ca2+ ion influx and, thereby, reduce CDI. The second, suggested by the DII (+1) position Asp 707 mutations, is that key portions of the SF play an active role in CDI. Because the loss of the negatively charged residue at DII (+1) did not dramatically alter channel selectivity properties or activation voltage dependency, we pursued further characterization of this site to understand whether the CaV SF might have a previously unappreciated role in the CDI mechanism. Alteration of the CaM binding IQ motif has different impacts on CaV1.2 CDI depending on whether oocytes or mammalian cells are used to measure function (). Therefore, to test whether the consequences of SF mutations on CDI were similarly expression system dependent, we measured the properties of the two mutants that had the strongest effects on CDI reduction of CaV1.2 in oocytes, D707A and E1115A, as well as the mutant that maintained the SF DII (+1) negative charge, D707E, using whole-cell recordings from transfected HEK293 cells (Figures 2A and S1B). As in oocytes, D707A, D707E, and E1115A caused a substantial reduction in CDI (Figures 2A\u20132C). The magnitude of the CDI diminishment was less pronounced in the E1115A mutant compared to oocytes, whereas this effect was comparable between the two different expression systems for D707A and D707E (Table 1). Similar to\u00a0oocytes, voltage-dependent activation and I-V curves of CaV1.2 and Asp 707 mutants were identical (Figures 2D and 2E). E1115A caused a small hyperpolarizing shift (\u22128\u00a0mV) in voltage-dependent activation, not seen in oocytes (Figure\u00a02E; Table 1), and perturbed the reversal potential, although this change is smaller in HEK293 cells (\u22129 versus \u221239\u00a0mV for HEK293 cells and Xenopus oocytes, respectively) (Figures 1G and 2E; Table 1). In further support of differential effects of the mutants on ion selectivity, similar to oocytes, the ability to discriminate Ca2+ over Ba2+, reflected by IBa/ICa > 1, was conserved in the Asp 707 mutants but was eliminated in E1115A (Figure\u00a0S2B; Table 1). Thus, in contrast to expression system-dependent differences in CDI at the level of the Ca2+ sensor (), our results demonstrate that the SF mutation-induced CDI changes are expression system independent and provide additional support for the idea that the reduction in CDI caused by the DII (+1) mutants are not related to changes in the ion selectivity properties of the channel. Although the DII (+1) mutations did not cause ion selectivity changes, in principle, the effects on CDI could be caused by reduction of Ca2+ influx via a change in channel open probability or conductance. To investigate this possibility, we compared low-noise recordings from the DII (+1) mutants that exhibited the most severe, D707A, and the mildest, D707N, CDI loss with CaV1.2. Because of the challenges associated with single CaV channel recordings when Ca2+ is the charge carrier (), we compared patches expressing CaV1.2, D707A, and D707N using Ba2+ as the charge carrier as in many prior studies (, , , , , , , ). These experiments showed single CaV1.2 channels having an \u223c1-pA current amplitude, consistent with prior reports (). By contrast, in patches expressing either D707A or D707N, we could only observe measurable currents characteristic of multi-channel recordings with maximal current of \u223c2\u00a0pA (Figure\u00a03A). These observations indicate that both the D707A and D707N decrease channel conductance relative to wild-type. To address whether there was a parallel reduction in Ca2+ conductance relative to the reduced level of CDI, we measured whole-cell Ca2+ currents of CaV1.2, D707A, and D707N (Figure\u00a03B) and compared their current densities (Figure\u00a03C). These data reveal similar current densities for D707A and D707N that are both reduced by \u223c80% relative to CaV1.2 (Figure\u00a03C) and that are consistent with the reduced channel conductance assessed by the low-noise recordings (Figure\u00a03A). The reduced single-channel conductance observed for D707A and D707N is in line with the ability of both mutants to cause similar reductions in Ca2+ binding to the channel pore () and points to a key role of the DII (+1) site in ion conduction. Importantly, the data indicate that the shared decrease in ion conduction caused by the DII (+1) mutations cannot be the origin of the loss of CDI in D707A, as two channels having similar low conductances, D707A and D707N, have completely different CDI phenotypes (Figures 1C\u20131E). To investigate whether reduced Ca2+ influx was the cause of CDI loss in D707A, we used the CaV agonist Bay K8644 that increases single-channel open times () to enhance Ca2+ influx through the channel. Bay K8644 application to Xenopus oocytes expressing CaV1.2, D707A, D707N, or the mutant E1115A, in which changes in ion selectivity reduce Ca2+ influx (, ), showed clear augmentation in Ca2+ current amplitude for all cases, consistent with an increase in channel openings and higher Ca2+ influx through individual channels () (Figures 3D and 3F). This Bay K8644-enhanced Ca2+ current was accompanied by a more complete inactivation for CaV1.2, D707N, and E1115A as measured by the percentage of inactivation 300\u00a0ms post-activation (ti300) (Figures 3D and 3G), consistent with prior studies of Bay K8644 on CaV1.2 in Xenopus oocytes (). However, for CaV1.2 and D707N, the equivalent level of increased inactivation was also observed when Ba2+ was used as charge carrier, indicating that this effect is a consequence of Bay K8644 itself rather than a response to the increased Ca2+ influx due to an undersaturated CaM Ca2+ sensor (Figures 3D, 3H, and 3I). By contrast, for the mutant having compromised selectivity, E1115A, CDI was enhanced beyond the level expected from the Bay K8644 effect in Ba2+ (Figure\u00a03I). Notably, Bay K8644-induced inactivation in Ca2+ is absent in the D707A mutant (Figures 3D, 3E, and 3G\u20133I). Hence, even though the magnitude of the Bay K8644-induced Ca2+ current increase was similar for CaV1.2, D707A, and D707N (Figure\u00a03F), the enhanced Ca2+-influx was not able to induce CDI for D707A (Figures 3E and 3G). Taken together, these observations establish that CDI loss in the D707A mutant is not caused by a reduced Ca2+ influx and strongly suggest that SF DII (+1) position plays an active role in CDI. The aspartate at the SF DII (+1) site is conserved among all CaVs (Figure\u00a01A) (, ). CDI occurs in high voltage-activated CaVs (CaV1s and CaV2s) (), and, among the L-type (CaV1) channels, the CaV1.342a variant exhibits the most pronounced CDI (, , ). Therefore, to examine the general importance of the DII (+1) aspartate for CDI, we asked whether removal of this aspartate would affect a channel in which CDI is particularly strong. We compared CaV1.342a CDI with a DII (+1) mutant and a DIII (0) mutant (D762A and E1121A, respectively) that correspond to the mutants that were most effective at reducing CaV1.2 CDI. Measurement of the functional properties of these channels in HEK293 cells showed that, as with the analogous CaV1.2 mutants, the DII (+1) mutation D726A drastically reduced CDI, whereas the DIII (0) mutation E1121A caused only a slight reduction in CDI (f\u00a0= 0.73\u00a0\u00b1 0.01, 0.15\u00a0\u00b1 0.05, and 0.63\u00a0\u00b1 0.02 for CaV1.3, D726A, and E1121A, respectively; Figures 4A\u20134C; Table\u00a01). Similar to our observations for CaV1.2, the DII (+1) mutant D726A had no effect on channel selectivity or the activation voltage dependency (Figures 2D and 2E; Table 1), whereas the DIII (0) mutant, E1121A, caused a slight leftward shift of both the reversal potential and the activation curve, comparable to the effects of E1115A on CaV1.2 (Figures 2D, 2E, 4D, and 4E; Table\u00a01). In addition, unlike the DII (+1) D726A change, the DIII\u00a0(0) E1121A substitution caused a significant reduction in the peak current IBa/ICa ratio to \u223c1, indicating a loss in the ability to discriminate between Ba2+ and Ca2+ (Figure\u00a0S2C; Table 1). Hence, as with CaV1.2, the effects of neutralizing the DIII (0) glutamate with respect to the observed CDI reduction are consistent with a change in ion selectivity. By contrast, neutralization of the DII (+1) aspartate spared all of the tested CaV1.3 biophysical parameters, except CDI. These results demonstrate the general importance of the DII (+1) aspartate in CaV1 channels and lend further support to the hypothesis that changes in the SF have a direct role in CDI. CaV2 channels also have CDI (, , ), and, similar to CaV1s, this process relies on CaM:IQ domain interactions (, , ). However, the roles of the CaM lobes are inverted between the two subfamilies, with the C-lobe controlling CDI in CaV1 () but the\u00a0N-lobe controlling CDI in CaV2s (, , ). To ask whether the conserved DII (+1) aspartate is important for CaV CDI regardless of which CaM lobe governs CDI, we measured the effects of mutants equivalent to CaV1.2 DII (+1) D707A and DIII (0) E1115A in a CaV2 family representative, CaV2.1 (D667A and E1461A, respectively). To quantify changes in CaV2.1 CDI, we measured the ratio between the current amplitude at peak and 800\u00a0ms post-depolarization (R800) for both Ba2+ and Ca2+ as a function of voltage () (Figures 4F and 4G) and compared the difference between Ba2+ and Ca2+ R800, f\u2032, for CaV2.1 and mutants at the potential of maximal current,\u00a0+10\u00a0mV (). As in the case of CaV1.2 and CaV1.3, DIII (0) neutralization caused a CDI reduction (f\u2032\u00a0= 0.26\u00a0\u00b1 0.03 and 0.12\u00a0\u00b1 0.02 for CaV2.1 and E1461A, respectively; Figure\u00a04H) and did not affect activation voltage dependency. However, this site (0) mutation did induce a \u221213 mV reversal potential shift and reduced peak current IBa/ICa ratio to \u223c1 (Figures 4H\u20134J and S2D; Table 1), consistent with an ion selectivity change. By contrast, neutralization of the CaV2.1 DII (+1) residue essentially eliminated CDI (f\u2032\u00a0=\u00a00.04\u00a0\u00b1 0.03; Figure\u00a04H) and did not affect the activation voltage dependency or the peak current IBa/ICa ratio (Figures 4J and S2D; Table 1), although it did cause a\u00a0+10 mV reversal potential shift (Figure\u00a04I). The clear loss of CaV2.1 CDI caused by the D667A mutation demonstrates the universal role of the CaV SF in CDI and establishes that this role is independent of the details of how the CDI is initiated by CaM. Together with the CaV1 results, these data support the idea that the SF is involved in the final step of the CaV CDI process. The four CaV SF domains contribute an identical set of negatively charged glutamate side chains at the (0) position but a set of non-equivalent residues at the (+1) site (G, D, G, and A for DI\u2013DIV, respectively) (Figures 1A and 1B). Given the crucial role we found for the DII (+1) aspartate in CDI (Figures 5A and 5B), and the fact that it is the sole negatively charged amino acid at this CaV SF level, we asked whether the DII (+1) position had a special role in CDI or whether CDI would be preserved if the aspartate were moved to other (+1) positions around the SF. Hence, we created a set of mutants that placed an aspartate at the DI, DIII, or DIV (+1) sites. To preserve the SF amino acid composition, each of these mutants exchanged the amino acid from the host site into the DII (+1) site to create the following swap mutants: DIAsp (G364D/D707G), DIIIAsp (D707G/G1116D), and DIVAsp (D707A/A1417D) (Figure\u00a05C). We recorded whole-cell currents from Xenopus oocytes injected with these constructs using Ca2+ and Ba2+ as charge carriers and compared these mutants with the corresponding single-point changes at DII (+1) (Figures 5C and 5D). Exchange of the SF (+1) aspartate between the DII and DI positions, DIAsp, yielded channels that had severely diminished CDI that was equivalent to the D707G mutant (Figures 5C\u20135E), indicating that the DI (+1) site aspartate was unable to restore CDI in the face of the loss of the aspartate at the DII (+1) position. By contrast, exchange of the SF (+1) aspartate from the DII to DIII positions, DIIIAsp, or from the DII to DIV positions, DIVAsp, resulted in complete or near complete CDI restoration, respectively (Figures 5C\u20135E). These results demonstrate the ability of a SF (+1) aspartate to preserve CDI when located on DIII or DIV but not DI. To test whether reduced Ca2+ influx was the cause of the compromised CDI in DIAsp, we examined the consequences of Bay K8644-enhanced Ca2+ influx on the SF (+1) swap mutants. Bay K8644 application increased Ca2+ currents by \u223c2-fold in all three (+1) swap mutants, similar to results on other SF mutants (Figures 3C, 3F, and 3G), but failed to enhance CDI in the channel having reduced CDI, DIAsp (Figures S6A, S6C, and S6D). Studies using Ba2+ showed that, as with our other SF (+1) Bay K8644 experiments (Figure\u00a03), inactivation is increased in a Ca2+-independent manner (Figures S6B, S6E, and S6F). These results indicate that reduced CDI of DIAsp is not caused by insufficient Ca2+ influx but is linked to a change in the ability of the SF to reach an inactivated state. The preservation of CDI in the DIIIAsp and DIVAsp swaps demonstrates that the single changes at DII (+1), D707G and D707A, do not preclude CDI provided that either\u00a0the DIII or DIV domain provides the SF position (+1) negative charge. The fact that CDI occurs only when the (+1) negative charge resides on DII, DIII, or DIV, but not DI, supports\u00a0the idea of asymmetric functional roles for the four elements of the SF (, , ) and indicates that the mere presence of\u00a0a negative charge at the SF (+1) level is insufficient to support\u00a0CDI. To probe whether the swap mutations affected the ability of the channel to bind Ca2+, we measured Ca2+ block of Li+ currents (, ). Interestingly, all three aspartate-swap mutants behaved identically to CaV1.2, indicating that the affinity for Ca2+ was preserved regardless of the domain that housed the (+1) aspartate (Figure\u00a05F). This result contrasts the reduction in Ca2+ binding caused by the single-point mutants at the DII (+1) position (Figure\u00a05F) (). The observation that Ca2+ binding is preserved when the aspartate is placed at any of the four possible site (+1) positions contrasts with the domain selective results for CDI that these mutants cause. This finding indicates that the involvement of the SF in CDI is not strictly related to its ability to bind Ca2+. These results together with the differential contributions of the individual (+1) sites to CDI support the idea that the SF has a direct role in CDI. CDI is an essential feature of high voltage-activated CaVs (CaV1s and CaV2s) that serves as an activity-dependent autoregulatory mechanism for limiting Ca2+ influx (, , , ). This process contributes to autism (), vision (), and cardiac action potential duration (, , , , , ) and is impacted by alternative splicing (, , ), RNA editing (), as well as mutations in CaM associated with long QT syndrome (, ). Because CDI is central to both the biophysical and physiological functions of CaVs, its molecular origins have been extensively investigated, especially from the vantage point of the intracellular, CaM-based sensor and the role of the IQ domain (, , , , , ). Although the involvement of this CaM-based sensor in CDI is firmly established, how conformational changes of this cytoplasmic element result in the cessation of ion flow through the channel and the exact CDI endpoint have remained unresolved (, , , , , ). Our observations provide the first evidence that the CaV SF is a central element of the CDI mechanism and constitutes the CDI gate. Three CaV channel intracellular elements contribute to CDI: the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain (, , , ), the CaV\u03b2/I-II loop complex (, ), and the C-terminal tail:CaM complex (, , , , , , , , ), with the C-terminal tail:CaM complex serving as the Ca2+ sensor that initiates CDI. Given this functionally interconnected network of domains that influence CDI, there has been an ongoing search to identify the molecular endpoints of CaV CDI (, , ). There has been much focus on the S6 pore lining helices as a candidate for the CDI endpoint (, , , ), as these transmembrane helices form the channel intracellular gate (, ) and are directly linked to two of the three domains that affect CDI. Given the involvement of many channel parts in CDI, an allosteric framework has been used to try to understand the actions of disease mutants on CDI (, , ). An alternative proposal is that the SF may participate in CDI through an ion-blocking model in which Ca2+affinity is increased in the inactivated state (). Our observations that SF DII (+1) site mutations such as D707A eliminate CDI but spare biophysical parameters related to the activation process are inconsistent with the proposal that the activation gate formed by S6 is the CDI endpoint (). Nevertheless, S6 is likely to be critical for coupling to the various intracellular domains that contribute to CDI and may mediate direct coupling between the activation gate and the SF-based CDI gate, similar to its role in other VGIC superfamily members (, , , , ). Further, in contrast to the proposal that CDI occurs through an increased affinity of the SF for Ca2+ (), we find that mutations that remove the aspartate at the SF DII (+1) site can have identical Ca2+ affinities but exhibit very different degrees of CDI (Figures 1 and 5) (). Together, our findings establish that the CaV SF serves as the CDI gate and recast the paradigm for understanding the CaV CDI mechanism with a focus on the SF. The pore domain of all VGIC superfamily members is made from four subunits arranged around the central ion-conducting pore () that share a common architectural fold comprising two transmembrane helices, the SF, and a short pore helix that supports the SF architecture (, ). Within the context of this shared architecture, studies of diverse VGIC superfamily members have begun to uncover a central role for SF in inactivation mechanisms, being best characterized in diverse potassium channel types including: KcsA (, ), Kvs (, , , ), and K2Ps (, , , , ). Additionally, structural observations of asymmetric BacNaV SF conformations (, ) and functional studies of SF (+4) position mutants () have suggested a role for the SF in BacNaV VDI that may be shared with eukaryotic NaVs and CaVs (). Studies of members of the TRP channel branch, TRPV1 (, ) and TRPM4 (), also support the idea that the SF constitutes a gate. Hence, the discovery that CaV CDI also relies on a SF-based mechanism sets CaVs squarely within the growing list of VGICs in which SF-based gating is central to function. The apparent widespread role of the SF in the inactivation processes of VGIC superfamily members suggests that these SF-based inactivation mechanisms capitalize on a fundamental pore domain (PD) property that predates the evolutionary divergence in ion selectivity and gating cue responses among the VGIC superfamily branches. This prevalence of SF-based inactivation mechanisms seems likely to have its origins in the shared ancient structure that forms the PD. Elements from the cytoplasmic side of the channel drive conformational changes that stop ion permeation for both CDI and VDI. Whether CaV CDI and VDI share a common mechanism has been unresolved (, , , , ). Our studies support the idea that both processes involve the SF. Notably, we find that there are selective effects on CDI or VDI depending on which parts of the SF structure are altered (Figures 1 and S4), supporting the idea that CDI and VDI have different endpoints even though they are affected by common channel elements (, , ). The VDI effects match those reported for BacNaVs () and support the idea that there is a common SF-based mechanism underlying VDI in BacNaVs, CaVs, and NaVs (). Considering our new findings of the importance of the SF in CDI together with prior cytoplasmic domain studies (, , , , , , , , , , , , ), we propose the following model in which SF conformational changes constitute the end stage of a CDI process that is initiated by CaM on the cytoplasmic side of the channel (Figure\u00a06). Upon activation by voltage, Ca2+ influx through the channel is sensed by CaM and initiates a set of conformational rearrangements that end with a conformational change in the SF that stops ion flow. Although the exact conformational changes underling CaV SF inactivation and complete accounting of the residues involved remain to be elaborated and ultimately will require structural studies of the channel trapped in various states, our data indicate that this process exploits the previously identified functional asymmetry in the CaV SF (, , ). In this regard, it is interesting to note that the SF DII (+1) aspartate seems capable of making interactions that involve other SF domain residues () and that we can restore CDI to DII (+1) SF mutants by supplying an aspartate at the equivalent site in two of the three other domains (Figure\u00a05). Our studies provide clear evidence that the CaV SF plays a central role in the CDI process by forming the CDI gate. The evidence for this CaV SF gate, together with the presence of an inner gate formed by the S6 helices (, , , , , ), establishes that CaVs use two gates to control their activity, similar to other VGIC superfamily members (, , , ). This finding creates a new framework for addressing how the two CaV gates interact, whether they are coupled in a manner similar to structurally related potassium channels (), whether there are commonalities in SF-based inactivation mechanisms between channels that have wide SFs such as CaVs versus those that intimately contact the permeant ions such as potassium channels (), and how the intracellular components that contribute to CDI (, , , , , , , , , , , , , , ) affect structural transitions in the SF gate. Such issues may be important for understanding how CaV disease mutations that impact CDI act (, , , , , , ) and how such functional defects may be overcome by pharmacological intervention.

Oocytes were harvested from female Xenopus laevis frogs purchased from Nasco and housed in the UCSF Laboratory Animal Resource Center (LARC) facilities. The use of these Xenopus oocytes was approved by IACUC (protocol approval # AN178461-01) and experiments were performed in accordance with University of California guidelines and regulations. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were purchased from ATCC (CRL-1573) and were grown at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2, in a Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10% L-glutamine, and antibiotics (100 IU mL\u22121 penicillin and 100\u00a0mg mL\u22121 streptomycin) (University of California, San Francisco Cell Culture Facility). The sex of cell line is not determined. Human CaV1.2 (\u03b11C77, GenBank: Z34815), human CaV2.1 (\u03b11A, GenBank: NM_001127221.1), rat Cav1.3 (\u03b11D, GenBank: AF370009.1), rat CaV\u03b22a (GenBank: NM_053851), rabbit CaV\u03b23 (GenBank: NM_001101715.2), and rabbit CaV\u03b12\u03b4-1 (GenBank: NM_001082276.1) were used for both patch clamp and two-electrode voltage clamp experiments. CaV1.2 mutations were introduced by two separate PCR reactions. First the region of interest was PCR amplified using pcDNA3.1 Cav1.2 as template. The PCR product was then subcloned into pcDNA3.1 by restriction-ligation. The new plasmid containing the region of interest was then used as template to introduce the desired mutation using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The region of interest containing the desired mutation was then subcloned back into the pcDNA3.1 Cav1.2 to form the mutant full-length channel using the following restriction sites: NheI-HpaI, HpaI-PpuMI, KpnI-AgeI, and AgeI-FseI, for DI, DII, DIII, and DIV mutants, respectively. CaV2.1 and CaV1.3 mutants were made using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent). All mutants were validated by complete sequencing of the genes encoding for the proteins of interest. Linearized cDNA was translated into capped mRNA using the T7\u00a0mMessenger kit (Ambion). We injected 50 nL of CaV1.2\u03b11, CaV\u03b22a or CaV\u03b23 and CaV\u03b12\u03b4-1 mRNA at a 1:1:1 molar ratio into Xenopus oocytes. Two-electrode voltage clamp experiments were performed 2\u20133\u00a0days post-injection. Oocytes were injected with 50 nL of 100\u00a0mM BAPTA four minutes before recording, to minimize calcium-activated chloride currents as previously described (). For recording of Ca2+ or Ba2+ currents, bath solutions contained 40\u00a0mM CaCl2 or 40\u00a0mM BaCl2, respectively, 50\u00a0mM NMDG-Cl, 1\u00a0mM KOH, 10\u00a0mM HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with HNO3. Measurements of Ca2+ block of Li+ currents followed previously described protocols (). The bath solution contained 100\u00a0mM LiOH, Ca(NO3)2 at test concentrations between 3\u00a0nM and 100\u00a0\u03bcM, and 10\u00a0mM HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with HNO3. Ca2+ concentrations were verified using a Ca2+ electrode. A solution having a nominal 3\u00a0nM free Ca2+ concentration was used as control condition and contained 170\u00a0\u03bcM Ca(NO3)2 and 15\u00a0mM ethylene glycol-bis(2-aminoethylether)-N, N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetraacetic acid (EGTA). Electrodes were filled with 3\u00a0M KCl and had resistances of 0.3\u20131.0 M\u03a9. Recordings were conducted at room temperature from a holding potential of \u221290\u00a0mV. Leak currents were subtracted using a P/4 protocol. HEK293 cells were transfected (in 35-mmdiameter wells) with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and plated onto coverslips coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA). Cells were transfected using a total of 4.4\u00a0\u03bcg DNA having a ratio by weight of 2:1.6:0.4:0.4 of CaV\u03b11:CaV\u03b22a:CaV\u03b12\u03b4-1:sv40 T-antigen plasmids. The SV40 T-antigen plasmid was used to increase channel expression. Transfected cells were identified visually using an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression in the second cassette of the plasmid expressing the \u03b22a subunit. Whole cell patch clamp () was used to record Ca2+ and Ba2+ currents at room temperature (23\u00a0\u00b1 2\u00b0C) 48\u201372\u00a0h post-transfection. Data acquisition was performed using pCLAMP 9 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (TW150F-3; World Precision instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA) and polished (MF-900 microforge; Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) to obtain 2\u20133 M\u03a9 resistances. Sixty to eighty percent of the voltage error due to the series resistance was compensated, and leak currents were subtracted using a P/4 protocol. For CaV1.2 and CaV1.3 experiments, the pipette solution contained 120\u00a0mM NMDG-Cl, 1\u00a0mM MgCl2, 5\u00a0mM EGTA, 4\u00a0mM Mg-ATP, 42\u00a0mM HEPES (pH 7.3 adjusted with Methane sulfonic acid). Bath solution contained 40\u00a0mM CaCl2 or 40\u00a0mM BaCl2, 1\u00a0mM MgCl2, 105\u00a0mM Tris (pH\u00a07.3 adjusted with Methane sulfonic acid). For CaV2.1 experiments, the pipette solution contained 120\u00a0mM NMDG-Cl, 1\u00a0mM MgCl2, 0.5\u00a0mM EGTA, 2\u00a0mM Mg-ATP, 60\u00a0mM HEPES (pH 7.3 adjusted with Methane sulfonic acid). Bath solution contained 10\u00a0mM CaCl2 or 10\u00a0mM BaCl2, 1\u00a0mM MgCl2, 150\u00a0mM Tris (pH 7.3 adjusted with Methane sulfonic acid). HEK cells were maintained and transfected as described above. Cell-attached configuration of the patch clamp technique () was used to record Ba2+ currents from single or multiple CaV1.2 channels at room temperature (23\u00a0\u00b1 2\u00b0C) 48\u201372\u00a0h post-transfection. Data acquisition was performed using pCLAMP 9 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Pipettes were pulled from quartz glass capillaries (QF100-70-7.5; Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA, USA) using a Laser-Based Micropipette puller (P-2000, Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA, USA), and filled with 140\u00a0mM TEA-Cl, 40\u00a0mM BaCl2, 10\u00a0mM HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted with TEA-OH). To zero membrane potential, the bath solution contained 132\u00a0mM\u00a0K glutamate, 5\u00a0mM KCl, 5\u00a0mM NaCl, 3\u00a0mM MgCl2, 2\u00a0mM EGTA, 10\u00a0mM glucose, 20\u00a0mM HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted with KOH) (). Recordings were low pass filtered with a cutoff frequency of 2 kHz and digitized at 50\u00a0ms. Patches were stimulated by a voltage ramp from \u221280 mV to 50 mV over the duration of 200\u00a0ms. The leak for each trace was subtracted using a linear fit added to an exponential fit. All results are from at least two independent oocyte batches or at least two independent transfections. Data were analyzed with Clampfit 10.6 (Axon Instruments). Activation curves were obtained by fitting the data with the following Boltzmann equation: I/Imax\u00a0= 1/(1+exp((V0.5-Vm)/k)), where V0.5 is the half-activation potential, Vm is the membrane potential, and k is the slope factor. Dose\u2013response curves were calculated as follows: Ix/I3nMCa2+\u00a0= 1/(1\u00a0+ x/IC50), where Ix is the current amplitude at the Ca2+ concentration x, I3nMCa2+ is the current amplitude at 3\u00a0nM and IC50 is the half-maximal inhibitory concentration. VDI time constant (\u03c4 \u03b9\u03bd\u03b1\u03c7\u03c4) was determined at a test potential of\u00a0+20\u00a0mV using the formula I\u00a0= A exp (-t/\u03c4)\u00a0+ C, where I is the recorded current, A is the peak current, C is the residual current at steady state, and t is the time. Current density was determined as the ratio between current amplitude (pA) and the membrane capacitance (pF). All the details of data analysis and statistical analysis can be found in the Method Details and figure/table legends.
