{"29/2/517": "Advanced SearchEfficient synaptic transmission requires the apposition of neurotransmitter release sites opposite clusters of postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors. Transmitter is released at active zones, which are composed of a large complex of proteins necessary for synaptic development and function. Many active zone proteins have been identified, but little is known of the mechanisms that ensure that each active zone receives the proper complement of proteins. Here we use a genetic analysis in  to demonstrate that the serine threonine kinase Unc-51 acts in the presynaptic motoneuron to regulate the localization of the active zone protein Bruchpilot opposite to glutamate receptors at each synapse. In the absence of Unc-51, many glutamate receptor clusters are unapposed to Bruchpilot, and ultrastructural analysis demonstrates that fewer active zones contain dense body T-bars. In addition to the presence of these aberrant synapses, there is also a decrease in the density of all synapses. This decrease in synaptic density and abnormal active zone composition is associated with impaired evoked transmitter release. Mechanistically, Unc-51 inhibits the activity of the MAP kinase ERK to promote synaptic development. In the  mutant, increased ERK activity leads to the decrease in synaptic density and the absence of Bruchpilot from many synapses. Hence, activated ERK negatively regulates synapse formation, resulting in either the absence of active zones or the formation of active zones without their proper complement of proteins. The Unc-51-dependent inhibition of ERK activity provides a potential mechanism for synapse-specific control of active zone protein composition and release probability.At the synapse, presynaptic release machinery is directly apposed to neurotransmitter receptors within the postsynaptic density. The active zone is the site of neurotransmitter release, and is composed of a large, macromolecular complex of proteins that are involved in the development and function of the synapse (Fejtova and Gundelfinger, 2006). While many active zone proteins have been identified, little is known of the signaling pathways that regulate the assembly of these proteins and ensure that each active zone receives the proper complement of proteins.The  neuromuscular junction is a favorite model system for identifying mechanisms that shape the development and function of the synaptic terminal, but until recently had been little used for the study of active zones (Collins and DiAntonio, 2007). This changed with the identification and characterization of Bruchpilot (Brp), the fly ortholog of the vertebrate active zone protein CAST (Wagh et al., 2006). Bruchpilot is present at every active zone, and is required for the active zone localization of presynaptic calcium channels and T-bars, a dense body specialization thought to promote efficient transmitter release (Kittel et al., 2006). Each  NMJ comprises hundred of active zones directly apposed to postsynaptic glutamate receptors, and these can be visualized with antibodies against Brp (Wagh et al., 2006) and the essential glutamate receptor subunit DGluRIII (Marrus et al., 2004). While each of these active zones is formed by the same presynaptic motoneuron, they have a heterogeneous release probability that correlates with the abundance of Brp (Marrus and DiAntonio, 2004). This suggests that mechanisms exist to regulate the efficacy of individual release sites, potentially by controlling the protein constituents of the active zone. To identify such mechanisms, we performed a large-scale screen for genes required to ensure that each postsynaptic cluster of glutamate receptors is apposed to an active zone containing Bruchpilot.Here we report that the serine threonine kinase Unc-51 functions in the presynaptic neuron to ensure that Bruchpilot is apposed to glutamate receptors at each synapse. In the absence of Unc-51, many glutamate receptor puncta are unapposed to Brp, and ultrastructural analysis demonstrates that fewer active zones contain T-bars. In addition to these aberrant synapses, many fewer synapses form in the mutant and there is a large deficit in evoked transmitter release. Mechanistically, Unc-51 promotes synaptic development by inhibiting the activation of the MAP kinase ERK. In the  mutant, excess ERK activity is responsible for the decreased synaptic density and the absence of Bruchpilot from each synapse. We propose a model in which activated ERK negatively regulates synapse formation, leading to the formation of active zones without Bruchpilot or, in more extreme cases, the complete absence of the synapse. This Unc-51-dependent downregulation of ERK activity is a potential mechanism for synapse-specific control of active zone protein composition and release probability.Flies were raised and maintained at 25\u00b0C on standard fly media. Wild-Type flies were either Canton S (CS) outcrossed to \u2212, elav-Gal4 (Yao and White, 1994), or G7-Gal4 (Zhang et al., 2001) based on the experiment. The following fly lines were obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center: P-element collection on the third chromosome (Bellen et al., 2004), deficiency line: , P-element insertions: P{EPgy2}Atg1EY09216 and P{EPgy2}Atg1EY07351 CG17667EY07351,  hypomorph,  (Lim et al., 1999). Excision lines of Unc-51 ( and ) that delete the first exon was generated by the excision of the P-element line EP(P) 3348 (obtained from Szeged  Stock Centre) using \u03942\u20133 transposase line. Two  mutant alleles,  and , were generated by imprecise excision, which deleted 804 bp and 1787 bp, respectively, toward downstream from the insertion point, deleting parts of the first exon, including the ATG initiation codon. These mutations caused pupal lethality and failed to complement each other. \u0394ATG13d line (Scott et al., 2004), another excision mutant was a gift from Dr. Thomas Neufeld (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN). All five of these  mutant lines and the deficiency in all possible transheterozygote combinations gave qualitatively similar phenotypes.  construct was generated by cloning the  cDNA (LD18893, obtained from the  Genomics Resource Center, Bloomington, IN) into a pUAST vector (Brand and Perrimon, 1993). To test whether varying the amounts of  would rescue the physiology defect, we used another motoneuron-specific driver OK-6 GAL4 (Aberle et al., 2002) and the C142-Gal4 driver, which expresses weakly in the neurons (de Jong et al., 2005), as well as altering the levels of expression by growing the flies at a lower (18\u00b0C) temperature. For the screen, all the lines that were not already balanced with a larval marker were crossed to a TM3, GFP balancer line, and non-GFP larvae were selected under fluorescence dissecting microscope with a GFP filter for dissection.Larvae were dissected and stained as described (Marrus et al., 2004; Wairkar et al., 2008). In brief, wandering third-instar larvae were dissected in cold PBS and fixed for \u223c5\u201310 min in Bouin's fixative and washed at least three times for 5 min each in PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100. Primary antibodies were used in the following dilutions: rabbit anti-GluRIII, 1:2500 (Marrus et al., 2004); mouse anti-BRP, 1:250 (Wagh et al., 2006) [obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, developed under the auspices of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and maintained by the Department of Biological Sciences of the University of Iowa (Iowa City, IA)]; rabbit anti-DVGLUT, 1:10,000 (Daniels et al., 2004); mouse anti-Dlg monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4f3, 1:2000 [developed by Corey S. Goodman (Renovis, San Francisco, CA)]; and Cy5-conjugated goat anti-HRP antibody, 1:1000 (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Goat Cy5-, Cy3-, and Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibodies against mouse and rabbit IgG were used at 1:1000 and were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch.Wandering third-instar larvae were dissected in ice-cold homogenization buffer (67 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 67 mm NaCl, 2 m urea, 1 mm EDTA, and 1.3% SDS) and stored immediately on dry ice. The samples were run on 10% SDS-PAGE gels according to standard procedures. Mouse anti-diphospho ERK (Sigma, catalog #M8159) and mouse anti-phospho p38 (Cell Signaling Technology) were used at 1:1000. The blot was stripped using standard procedures and then probed for nonphosphorylated ERK-MAP kinase using rabbit anti-rolled antibody (Peverali et al., 1996) at 1:1000. Mouse anti-syntaxin antibody (8C3) and mouse anti-\u03b2-tubulin (E7) antibody were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, developed under the auspices of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and maintained by the Department of Biological Sciences of the University of Iowa, were used at 1:100. HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used at 1:10,000.Imaging and analysis was done as described previously (Viquez et al., 2006) with the following minor differences. The experimenter was blinded to genotypes during both imaging and analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA for comparison of samples within an experimental group.  for each condition is described either in the figures or in the results section. All histograms and measurements are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM. Bruchpilot (BRP) and DGluRIII puncta were manually counted at MN4b synapses on muscle 4. DGluRIII puncta that were not opposite to a detectable BRP punctum were counted as unapposed DGluRIII puncta. Area of NMJ was calculated by threshold function in MetaMorph for HRP channel. For the analysis of the axon transport phenotype, a box was drawn along a region of axon approximately between segments A3 and A4 and the same size box was used to measure the intensity of BRP in both mutants and wild type. HRP was used to threshold the area within the box. ImageJ was used to analyze the intensity of bands on the Western blots and the measure function in the program was used to quantify the intensity of bands. Ratio of the intensity of diphospho (activated) ERK bands to that of syntaxin bands was calculated and used for calculating the statistical difference between the genotypes. One-way ANOVA was performed to determine significance of the difference between band intensities in an experimental group. For electron microscopy analysis, bouton circumference was measured using the free hand tool in MetaMorph and by measuring around the outer margin of the bouton. T-bars and active zones were readily recognizable due to their electron dense appearance. Both of them were manually counted. An active zone was recognized by electron dense region of a bouton that had the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes tightly apposed to each other. A T-bar was defined as a membrane structure protruding from the electron-dense active zones and surrounded by vesicles.Intracellular electrophysiological recordings were performed as previously described (Marrus et al., 2004). Briefly, wandering third-instar larvae were dissected in 0 mm Ca2+ Stewart saline (HL3) (Stewart et al., 1994). Both spontaneous miniature excitatory junction potentials (mEJPs) and evoked potentials (EJPs) were then recorded in either 0.4 or 0.42 mm HL3. Calcium concentration was identical for every cell within an experiment. At least 60 consecutive miniature events were measured per cell using MiniAnalysis (Synaptosoft) and averaged to determine mean mEJP. Events with a slow rise time were rejected as likely artifacts arising from neighboring electrically coupled muscle cells. To record evoked EJPs, segmental nerves were cut and suctioned into a stimulating electrode, in which they received a brief depolarizing pulse. Quantal content was estimated by dividing the mean EJP by the mean mEJP (EJP/mEJP). Cells across all genotypes had similar mean input resistances and resting potentials. Quantal size was not significantly different among any of the genotypes compared with wild-type controls. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA to compare samples in an experimental group.The larval head and tail were pinned and a dorsal slit was made lengthwise, thus filleting the larvae \u2013 in phosphate buffer. The larvae were then placed into fixative (2% paraformaldehyde/2.5% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3) o/n. The larvae were transferred to cacodylate buffer, postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, then washed three times with cacodylate buffer. The larvae were dehydrated through 60 (1\u00d7, 7 min), 70, 80, 95 and 100% EtOH (2\u00d7, 10 min each step), transferred into propylene oxide (2\u00d7, 10 min), then into a 1:1 mixture of propylene oxide and Eponate, and left o/n, capped and at room temp. The larvae were then placed into fresh Eponate and into a mold, oriented and allowed to polymerize at 70\u00b0C. Thin sections were made and placed on Superfrost/plus micro slides, heated on a hot plate and stained with Toluidine Blue \u201cO.\u201d Type 1b boutons from NMJ6/7 in segment A2 from wild-type and mutant larval neuromuscular junctions were identified from the thin sections. Sections were cut at 50 nm with a diamond knife, picked up on formvar-coated, copper slot grids, and stained with 5% aqueous uranyl acetate for 15 min followed by Sato's lead stain for 1 min. Samples were observed and photographed in an FEI Tecnai G2 transmission electron microscope.Each  neuromuscular junction comprises hundreds of individual synapses. At each synapse, the presynaptic machinery for neurotransmitter release is directly apposed to the postsynaptic machinery for neurotransmitter detection. This apposition of presynaptic and postsynaptic specializations is essential for the efficacy of synaptic transmission. To identify molecular pathways that regulate this apposition process, we have undertaken a genetic screen for mutants that disrupt the apposition of presynaptic active zones to postsynaptic glutamate receptor clusters. As an assay for synaptic apposition, we have double-stained for the active zone protein Bruchpilot [Brp, the  ortholog of the vertebrate active zone protein CAST (Wagh et al., 2006)], and the essential postsynaptic glutamate receptor subunit DGluRIII (Marrus et al., 2004). At a wild-type NMJ, essentially every Brp punctum is aligned with a DGluRIII punctum (Marrus and DiAntonio, 2004) (Fig. 1). We screened a collection of \u223c1500 P-element insertion lines on the third chromosome for mutants (Bellen et al., 2004) with abnormalities in the alignment of BRP and DGluRIII. We identified one line, P{EPgy2}Atg1EY09216, in which many DGluRIII clusters are not apposed by a detectable BRP punctum. This P-element is inserted in  (also called Pegarn), a serine-threonine kinase that is the  ortholog of Unc-51 from  and vertebrates (Scott et al., 2004; Ahantarig et al., 2008). Atg1 participates in autophagy in , while Unc-51 is required for normal axon outgrowth in mouse and worms (Tomoda et al., 1999; Scott et al., 2004; Tomoda et al., 2004). Due to the confusion in cross-species nomenclature, we will refer to the gene here by the name used in mammals and worms, . In , there is a predicted gene within the intron of , , which could also be disrupted by the P-element insertion. Therefore, we obtained additional P-element insertions lines (see Materials and Methods) and generated imprecise excision mutants from a ), which is inserted within the first exon of the  gene, 539 bp upstream of the ATG initiation codon. Two independent excision lines ( and ) were identified which remove the first exon of  without disrupting . Larvae homozygous for each of these alleles also showed unapposed glutamate receptor puncta. To quantify these data, we counted the number of BRP puncta and DGluRIII puncta made by the MN4b motoneuron onto muscle four, although qualitatively similar results were observed at every type I glutamatergic NMJ. In the  mutant \u223c40% of glutamate receptors are not apposed to any detectable BRP puncta (Fig. 1). We see a qualitatively similar apposition phenotype with transheterozygous combinations of the excision mutants with multiple P-insertion lines as well as a deficiency line () that deletes the  gene (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material, and data not shown). Since multiple alleles show the same phenotype and, as is shown below,  transgene expression rescues the phenotype, we conclude that  is required for proper apposition of active zones and glutamate receptors.Unc-51 is required for normal synaptic density and apposition. , Sample confocal images of larval NMJs from muscle 4 stained with antibodies against BRP (red), DGluRIII (green), and HRP (blue). The genotypes of the larvae are as follows: WT (CS crossed to elav-GAL4),  deletion mutant, and  (; ). Insets show magnified view of boutons. Note the many DGluRIII puncta (arrowheads) without a detectable BRP punctum in the mutant. , Histograms of NMJ area (), glutamate receptor density (), BRP density (), and ratio of BRP to DGluRIII () at WT, , and  NMJs, muscle 4.  = 10 for all the genotypes; *** < 0.001 and ** < 0.01. Error bars represent SEM. Scale bar, 2 \u03bcm.While we screened for an apposition defect, these mutants display a number of other interesting phenotypes. First, the size of the NMJ is much smaller in the mutant, with an approximately fourfold reduction in the total area (Fig. 1). However, the change in the size of the NMJ is not commensurate with the change in the number of synapses. When we counted the number of DGluRIII puncta, which are present at every synapse in wild type, we found a more than sixfold decrease (WT: DGluRIII number = 242 \u00b1 22,  = 9; : DGluRIII number = 39 \u00b1 6,  = 9;  < 0.001). Calculating the density of DGluRIII puncta reveals a >30% reduction in mutant (Fig. 1). The reduction in the number of Brp puncta is even more striking, showing a nearly 10-fold decrease (WT: BRP number = 242 \u00b1 24,  = 9; : BRP puncta = 25 \u00b1 8,  = 9;  < 0.001), leading to a >60% reduction in the density of Brp puncta in the mutant (Fig. 1). These results demonstrate that there is a dramatic decrease in both the absolute number and density of synapses in the mutant. Finally, we observed large accumulations of Brp (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) and the synaptic vesicle protein DVGLUT (supplemental Fig. 3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) in mutant axons. Such accumulations are a hallmark of defective axon transport (Duncan and Goldstein, 2006).To demonstrate that these phenotypes result from the loss of  and to determine where gene function is required, we performed genetic rescue experiments. We generated transgenic flies carrying the  gene under the control of UAS promoter (Brand and Perrimon, 1993). Expression of the transgene in the motoneuron using the neuronal driver elav-Gal4 rescues all morphological phenotypes associated with  mutants. In the rescued mutant the synaptic defects are fully rescued: the density of DGluRIII puncta, the density of BRP puncta, and the apposition of Brp puncta to DGluRIII puncta are all returned to wild-type levels (Fig. 1). In addition, the NMJ area is increased more than twofold compared with the mutant (Fig. 1), while the axonal accumulations are decreased by about half (supplemental Fig. 3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Postsynaptic expression of the  transgene using G7-Gal4 driver does not rescue any of the defects (data not shown). Hence,  is required in the presynaptic motoneuron. In addition, selectively inhibiting Unc-51 function in the presynaptic cell via expression of a transgenic RNAi line phenocopies the  mutant. Neuronal RNAi knockdown leads to unapposed DGluRIII puncta, a reduction in synaptic density, a decrease in NMJ area, and accumulation of synaptic material in the axon including BRP and vesicle associated proteins like DVGLUT (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material, and data not shown), suggesting that the axon transport defect is not specific for a particular synaptic protein. Hence, the wild-type function of  is to act in the motoneuron to promote a high density of synapses, and to ensure that molecular constituents of the release site localize opposite to each postsynaptic density.In some mutants with axon transport defects such as  mutants, a smaller NMJ is observed and is due in part to retraction of the presynaptic terminal (Eaton et al., 2002). Such retraction could not explain the synaptic apposition defect of the  mutant, because unapposed DGluRIII puncta are present in a salt-and-pepper pattern throughout the NMJ, rather than only in the distal boutons as would be predicted for the progressive retraction of the synaptic terminal. However the small size of the NMJ in the mutant could be due to such retraction, so we assayed for synaptic retraction in the  mutant. The hallmark of synaptic retraction is the presence of \u201csynaptic footprints,\u201d in which postsynaptic markers such as the PDZ-protein Dlg are unapposed to synaptic vesicle proteins or presynaptic membrane (Eaton et al., 2002). To test whether  mutants have a retraction phenotype, we stained wild type and  mutants for the synaptic vesicle protein DVGLUT and the presynaptic membrane marker HRP, as well as the postsynaptic marker Dlg. We did not observe synaptic footprints, even in severe cases in which the NMJ size was drastically reduced (Fig. 2). Hence, the small size of the NMJ in the  mutant is not due to a failure to maintain the presynaptic terminal at the NMJ, but instead suggests a defect in the development of the NMJ.unc-51 mutants do not show a retraction-like phenotype. Sample NMJs stained with antibodies against postsynaptic membrane marker Discs-Large (Dlg) (red), presynaptic vesicle marker DVGLUT (green), and presynaptic membrane marker HRP (blue). The following genotypes were used: WT (CS crossed to ) and  deletion mutant. Even in severe cases (as the example shown in the figure), the presynaptic marker DVGLUT is present opposite the postsynaptic Dlg protein.Our confocal analysis of synaptic structure makes several predictions about synaptic ultrastructure in the  mutant. First, immunoelectron microscopic studies of glutamate receptors reveal that glutamate receptors are clustered opposite every active zone (Petersen et al., 1997). Since the density of DGluRIII puncta is reduced in the mutant, we predict a decrease in active zone density. Second, Brp is necessary for the localization of the dense body T-bar to the active zone (Kittel et al., 2006). Since many DGluRIII puncta are unapposed to Brp, we predict that there will be fewer T-bars/active zone in the mutant. In addition, since the density of Brp puncta is decreased, we also expect a decrease in the density of T-bars. Electron microscopic analysis of wild-type and  mutant NMJs from type 1b boutons confirmed our predictions. In wild-type type Ib boutons are filled with vesicles and are surrounded by a subsynaptic reticulum, which is an extensive postsynaptic membrane-infolding (Fig. 3). Active zones are apparent as regions of increased electron density where the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes are tightly apposed. The T-bar is a dense body specialization thought to promote release of transmitter that is observed as a T-like structure at a subset of active zones. Typically, synaptic vesicles are seen clustered near the T-bars. While the mutant the synaptic ultrastructure is broadly similar to wild type, with active zones, T-bars, and synaptic vesicles, we observed a number of quantitative phenotypes that are consistent with our light-level analysis. First, the density of active zones is decreased by \u223c25% in the mutant (Fig. 3), consistent with the \u223c35% decrease in DGluRIII puncta measured at the light level. Second,  mutants showed a 33% decrease in active zones containing a T-bar (Fig. 3), which corresponds to the \u223c40% of unapposed DGluRIII puncta seen with the confocal. Finally, the mutants also exhibit a >50% decrease in the density of T-bars (Fig. 3), which is in excellent agreement with the \u223c60% reduction in the density of Brp puncta observed with light microscopy. Thus in the absence of , synaptic density is dramatically decreased and is accompanied by many abnormal active zones which lack T-bar specializations.unc-51 mutants have a decreased density of T-bars. , Sample electron micrographs of 1b boutons from WT and  mutant larvae. Both the genotypes have an SSR and active zones seen as electron dense regions of presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes (arrows). T-bars are seen in the WT as a T-shaped structure (arrowheads) and typically surrounded by synaptic vesicles. , Histograms show active zone number per bouton circumference (), T-bars per active zones (), and T-bars per bouton circumference (). WT,  = 20 boutons and ,  = 30 boutons; * < 0.05, ** < 0.01, *** < 0.001. Error bars represent SEM. Scale bar, 1 \u03bcm.The  mutant exhibits defects in both the number and structure of active zones, either of which could impair synaptic function. To investigate the strength of synaptic transmission in this mutant, we measured both evoked and spontaneous neurotransmitter release at the NMJ. We performed intracellular electrophysiological recordings from muscle 6, segment A2 or A3 from both wild type and  mutants (Fig. 4). Consistent with the morphological defects, there is an approximately threefold reduction in the amplitude of evoked excitatory junction potentials (EJPs) in two different allelic combinations of  mutants compared with wild type (Fig. 4). A defect in EJP amplitude could be due to the release of fewer vesicles from the nerve, or to a decrease in postsynaptic sensitivity to transmitter. To distinguish between these possibilities, we recorded spontaneous miniature junctional potentials (mEJPs), which are a measure of the postsynaptic response to the fusion of a single synaptic vesicle. In contrast to evoked release, there is no significant difference in the amplitude of mEJPs in these genotypes (WT = 0.88 \u00b1 0.08 mV,  = 0.73 \u00b1 0.06 mV, /16816 = 0.80 \u00b1 0.03 mV,  = 10,  = 0.1), suggesting a presynaptic defect in transmitter release. Quantal content is a measure of the number of synaptic vesicles released by the presynaptic terminal following an action potential. Calculating quantal content by the direct method (EJP/mEJP) reveals a three-to-fourfold reduction in the number of synaptic vesicles released in the mutant (Fig. 4). Consistent with a defect in presynaptic release, we observe a decrease in the frequency of mEJPs in both  mutants, although the difference is only statistically significant in one genotype (WT = 2.4 \u00b1 0.2,  = 2.0 \u00b1 0.3 and / = 1.6 \u00b1 0.2,  < 0.05 for WT: / and  = 0.3 for WT: ,  = 10). These findings demonstrate that  is required for normal synaptic transmission, potentially due to the reduced number of morphologically normal synapses in the mutant.Evoked transmitter release is impaired in  mutants. , Representative spontaneous mEJPs from the following genotypes: WT (CS or eLav crossed to \u2212),  deletion mutants, hypomorphic allele  (/{}), , , and a wild-type larva overexpressing  presynaptically (elav-Gal4 crossed to  transgene). , Representative evoked EJPs from the same genotypes as in . , , Histograms show the mean EJP amplitudes () and quantal content (). Quantal content was calculated by dividing the EJP amplitude by the mEJP amplitude for the same cell. *** < 0.001. Error bars represent SEM and  \u2265 9 for all genotypes.Transgenic expression of  rescues the morphological phenotypes of the  mutant, so we expected that that it would also rescue the physiological phenotypes. Surprisingly, we were unable to rescue the quantal content defect (Fig. 4). Since Unc-51 is a kinase, its overexpression may be deleterious and hence obscure our efforts to observe rescue. To test this possibility, we overexpressed  in motoneurons in an otherwise wild-type background and observed more than threefold reduction in quantal content (Fig. 4) as well as a modest reduction in mEJP frequency (WT: 2.4 \u00b1 0.2, : 1.3 \u00b1 0.2, : 1.1 \u00b1 0.1,  \u2265 9 for all genotypes and  < 0.01) (Fig. 4). This demonstrates that the level of  expression is important for synaptic transmission. Overexpression of  is unlikely to act as a dominant negative, as its overexpression does not lead to any of the synaptic morphology defects characteristic of the loss-of-function mutant (supplemental Fig. 4, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). In an effort to express lower levels of  we tested other Gal4 lines and varied temperature (see Materials and Methods), but we did not find a combination that rescued the physiological phenotype. The failure to rescue this one aspect of the phenotype indicates that either the electrophysiological defect is not due to the loss of  or that this phenotype is sensitive to the precise levels or timing of  expression. We suggest that it is likely that the defect in evoked release is due to the loss of  because the same phenotype is present in all tested  alleles, the phenotype is consistent with the morphological defects, and both the morphological and physiological defects can be suppressed by inhibiting a downstream target of Unc-51 (see below).What might be the mechanism by which Unc-51 regulates the structure and function of synapses? Unc-51 participates in many different pathways in different systems. In yeast, , and vertebrates, orthologs of Unc-51 participate in starvation-induced autophagy, a lysosomal process of cytoplasmic degradation that provides nutrients to the cell under starvation conditions (Kamada et al., 2000; Scott et al., 2004; Aladzsity et al., 2007; Cheong and Klionsky, 2008). We tested mutants in other genes required for autophagy and find they do not share the synaptic phenotypes of the  mutants (Y. Wairkar and A. DiAntonio, unpublished observations). Therefore, the observed synaptic defects are not likely due to a generic block in autophagy. In addition, Unc-51 interacts with microtubule-associated proteins and so could regulate axon transport (Okazaki et al., 2000). Since we see defects consistent with disrupted axon transport, this function is likely conserved in . However, as shown below, we have genetically separated the axon transport and synaptic defects, and thus defective transport cannot be the cause of the synaptic defects. Finally, Unc-51 interacts with a number of proteins that function upstream of the ERK-MAP kinase pathway, including the ras-GAP SynGAP and the FGF receptor binding protein FRS 2/3 (Tomoda et al., 2004; Avery et al., 2007). While these interactions are well described, to our knowledge Unc-51-dependent changes in ERK activity  have not been reported. To test the hypothesis that Unc-51 regulates ERK activity, we measured the levels of active diphosphorylated ERK (dp-ERK) from brain and body wall preparations of wild-type and  mutant larvae. Immunoblot analysis reveals an increase in the levels of dp-ERK in the  mutants that is rescued by the neuronal expression of  (dp-ERK: WT = 100% \u00b1 20%,  = 184% \u00b1 13%,  + rescue = 101% \u00b1 17%,  = 3,  = 0.02). In these genotypes there is no change in the levels of total ERK (WT = 18.3 \u00b1 2.6 AU,  = 15.3 \u00b1 5.3 AU, rescue = 13 \u00b1 4.1 AU,  = 3,  > 0.6) or syntaxin (WT = 41.3 \u00b1 9.7 AU,  = 42.6 \u00b1 6.6 AU, rescue = 45.3 \u00b1 9.1 AU,  = 3,  > 0.9) (Fig. 5). Hence,  is required  to inhibit ERK activity.Unc-51 inhibits ERK activation. Western blot probed using anti-diphospho (activated) ERK, anti-rolled and anti-syntaxin antibody. Activated ERK is increased in  mutants compared with wild type ( = 3,  < 0.05). Neuronal expression of  transgene in the mutant rescues the increase in activated ERK levels ( = 3,  < 0.05). Levels of ERK are not significantly different among the three genotypes ( = 3,  = 0.2). Genotypes used are as follows: WT (CS crossed to elav-GAL4),  deletion mutant, and  ().If excess ERK activity contributes to the  synaptic phenotypes, then reducing ERK activity should suppress those defects. ERK null mutants are embryonic lethal (Biggs et al., 1994), so we generated a double mutant between 3 and the well characterized ERK () hypomorph, , that survives past the larval stage (Lim et al., 1999). We stained the NMJs of wild-type,  mutant,  mutant, and ,  double mutant larvae for the active zone component Brp and the glutamate receptor DGluRIII. Quantitative analysis was performed at the identified NMJ formed by the Mn4b motoneuron onto muscle 4, although results were qualitatively similar at all type 1 glutamatergic NMJs. There is no significant difference in the NMJ area, synapse density, or apposition between Brp and DGluRIII in the ERK hypomorph  when compared with wild type. As shown above,  mutants display a decrease in synapse area, a decrease in synapse density and a high degree of misapposition between Brp and DGluRIII. In the 3,  double mutant there is dramatic suppression of each of these phenotypes (Fig. 6). The double mutant shows a more than twofold increase in the NMJ area, and a complete suppression of the synaptic density and apposition phenotypes to wild-type levels. Hence, increased ERK activity is required for the Unc-51 synaptic defects. There is an additional  phenotype, the accumulation of synaptic material in the axon that is indicative of an axon transport defect. Of note, this axon transport defect is not suppressed in the double mutant (Fig. 7,). Therefore, the axonal and synaptic defects of the  mutant are genetically separable, and so the transport defects cannot be responsible for the synaptic defects. Instead, these results suggest that Unc-51 regulates at least two pathways. It is required to downregulate ERK activity to ensure proper synaptic development, and works via a second, unknown pathway to promote proper axonal transport.Mutations in  suppress the synaptic morphology phenotypes of  mutants. , Sample NMJs stained with antibodies against BRP (red), DGluRIII (green), and HRP (blue).

Intensity of HRP was not significantly different among genotypes ( = 9,  = 0.1).Having demonstrated that  suppresses the synaptic morphology defects of the  mutant, we next tested whether it also suppresses the defects in synaptic function. Evoked and spontaneous synaptic events were recorded from muscle 6, segments A2/A3 in the same four genotypes described above. While synapse morphology is normal in the  mutant, synaptic transmission is not. There is an approximately fourfold decrease in the amplitude of evoked EJPs in the  mutant, which is very similar to the defect in evoked release observed in the  mutant. Remarkably, although both single mutants show large decreases in synaptic strength, evoked release returns to wild-type levels in the double mutant. There is no significant difference in the amplitude of mEJPs in any of the four genotypes, so the change in evoked release is likely due to a change in the number of vesicles released from the presynaptic terminal. Calculating quantal content reveals that both the  mutant and  release at least threefold fewer vesicles following an action potential, while release in the double mutant is indistinguishable from wild type (Fig. 8). These findings have two implications. First, the suppression of the  phenotype by  is consistent with the morphological findings and demonstrates that synaptic transmission in the  mutant is impaired due to the failure to inhibit ERK activity. Since increased ERK activity leads to a dramatic decrease in the number of structurally normal synapses, this is likely the cause of the defect in evoked release in the  mutant. Second, the deficit in evoked release in the  mutant suggests that decreasing levels of ERK also disrupt evoked release, albeit in the absence of synaptic morphology defects, and that this can be suppressed by the loss of Unc-51 inhibition of ERK function. These results suggest that the Unc-51 kinase may bidirectionally regulate ERK activity to control synaptic strength.Mutations in  suppress the  defect in evoked transmitter release. , , Representative spontaneous mEJPs () and EJPs () are shown from the same genotypes as in Figure 5. , , Histograms show the mean EJP amplitude () and quantal content () from WT (CS crossed to \u2212),  deletion mutant, homozygous  hypomorphs, and + (; ). *** < 0.001;  = 10 for all genotypes; and error bars represent SEM.  < 0.001 when either  is compared with either wild type or double mutant. There is no significant difference between WT and double mutant ( = 0.3). Calibration: mEJP, 2.5 mV, 100 ms; EJP, 5 mV, 5 ms.The close apposition of active zones to postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors ensures that receptors encounter a high concentration of transmitter following synaptic vesicle fusion. However not every active zone formed by a single presynaptic cell has the same probability of releasing transmitter, implying that synapse-specific mechanisms exist to control active zone function. While many active zone proteins have been identified and characterized, little is known of the mechanisms that ensure that each active zone receives its proper complement of proteins. To identify such mechanisms, we have undertaken a genetic screen to identify genes required to ensure the apposition of such structurally normal active zones opposite each postsynaptic density. We demonstrate that the serine threonine kinase Unc-51 acts presynaptically to regulate the localization of the active zone protein Bruchpilot opposite to glutamate receptors at each synapse. In the absence of Unc-51, there is both a decrease in the density of synapses as well as the presence of abnormal synapses lacking their full complement of active zone proteins, leading to impaired transmitter release. Unc-51 regulates active zone development by inhibiting the activity of the MAP kinase ERK. This Unc-51-dependent inhibition of ERK activity provides a potential mechanism for synapse-specific control of active zone protein composition and release probability.Active zones are the site of synaptic vesicle docking and fusion (Rosenmund et al., 2003). Many active zone proteins have been identified (Zhai and Bellen, 2004; Zhen and Jin, 2004), although mutational analysis has not identified any proteins that are essential for active zone formation. Instead, loss of function analysis reveals defects in the function or morphology of active zones. For example, mutations in syd-2/liprin in both worms and flies lead to larger active zones, demonstrating its central role for organizing the active zone (Dai et al., 2006; Patel et al., 2006).  contains orthologs of most vertebrate active zone proteins, the best characterized of which is Bruchpilot, the ortholog of CAST (Kittel et al., 2006; Wagh et al., 2006). Bruchpilot is present at the active zone, and promotes the active zone localization of calcium channels and the electron-dense T-bar specialization. As such, Bruchpilot is likely a key determinant of release probability at each active zone. Consistent with this view, synaptic transmission is impaired in  mutants (Wagh et al., 2006), and active zones with a higher release probability tend to have more Bruchpilot (Marrus and DiAntonio, 2004).We performed a large-scale anatomical screen to identify mutants where not every glutamate receptor cluster is apposed to Bruchpilot. We put aside mutants with a global decrease in Brp or DGluRIII across the NMJ, and instead focused on mutants in which Brp was absent from a subset of synapses. Such mutants were identified by the presence of glutamate receptor clusters unapposed to Bruchpilot puncta. In this screen we identified mutants in .In the  mutant many DGluRIII clusters are unapposed to Brp. Such misapposition could reflect either DGluRIII clusters unapposed to active zones, or receptor clusters apposed to abnormal active zones that do not contain Brp. The ideal experiment to distinguish between these possibilities would be to stain for other presynaptic active zone proteins. Unfortunately the only other such protein that can be visualized in  is the calcium channel cacophony, and since its localization depends on Brp this experiment is not be informative. Nonetheless, two results strongly suggest that a subset of glutamate receptors is apposed to abnormal active zones. First, the decreased density of DGluRIII clusters observed via confocal microscopy approximates the decrease in active zone density observed via electron microscopy. If many DGluRIII clusters were unapposed to active zones, then we would have expected a more dramatic decrease in active zone density. Second, ultrastructural analysis demonstrates a decrease in the proportion of active zones containing T-bars. Brp is not necessary for the formation of active zones, but is required for the localization of T-bars to active zones (Kittel et al., 2006; Wagh et al., 2006). If the absence of Brp were due to the absence of the entire active zone, then each active zone would contain Brp and we would have predicted a normal ratio of T-bars/active zones. Instead, the decrease in T-bars/active zone is consistent with the presence of active zones missing Brp and, hence, lacking T-bars. Therefore, we conclude that Unc-51 is required for the high fidelity of active zone assembly, ensuring that Brp is present at every active zone.In addition to the presence of abnormal synapses in the  mutant, there is also a decrease in the number and density of synapses. We speculate that the decrease in synaptic density and the presence of abnormal synapses may be related phenotypes that differ in severity. In this view, Unc-51 promotes synapse formation. In its absence, active zone assembly would be less efficient, resulting in either the formation of abnormal active zones missing crucial proteins such as Brp, or in more severe cases leading to complete failure of active zone assembly and, hence, the absence of a synapse. The complete suppression of both the synaptic density and apposition phenotypes by mutation of the downstream target ERK is consistent with these phenotypes sharing an underlying mechanism. As expected, this defect in the number and proper assembly of synapses leads to a dramatic decrease in synaptic efficacy.In addition to these synaptic defects, the  mutant also has a smaller NMJ and accumulations of synaptic material in the axons, suggesting defects in axonal transport. One mechanism that could link a small NMJ with defective transport is synaptic retraction, in which entire presynaptic boutons or branches retract leaving a footprint of postsynaptic proteins (Eaton et al., 2002). However, we did not observe such footprints in the  mutant, so this is not the cause of the small NMJ. Synaptic growth requires the retrograde transport of a BMP signal to the nucleus (Marqu\u00e9s et al., 2003; McCabe et al., 2003), however we found no change in the levels of phosphorylated MAD in motoneuron nuclei (data not shown), suggesting that this is not a likely cause of the growth defect. Finally, in worms and mice Unc-51 is required for axon outgrowth, which may be somewhat analogous to defects in NMJ growth in . However, to form an NMJ the axon must navigate out of the ventral nerve cord and cross a wide expanse of muscle before reaching its target and forming a junction. Since we do not observe defects in the pattern of neuromuscular innervation, it is unlikely that a generic defect in axon outgrowth is responsible for the small NMJs. The apparent axonal transport defect is consistent with findings from mammals suggesting a function for Unc-51 in regulating axon transport. We have not investigated the role of Unc-51 for transport, but note that we were able to genetically separate the axonal transport and synapse development phenotypes, so the transport phenotypes may not be primary cause of the synaptic defects.Our data support the model that Unc-51 inhibits ERK activation to promote proper active zone development. In the  mutant we observed a modest increase in the levels of activated ERK, demonstrating that Unc-51 is a negative regulator of ERK activation . This increased ERK activity is responsible for the defects in active zone formation. Double mutants between  and the ERK hypomorph  completely suppress the synapse density and apposition phenotypes of the  mutant, and restore synaptic strength to wild-type levels. Hence, ERK is required for the synaptic phenotypes observed in the  mutant. The axonal transport defects were not suppressed in the double mutant, so Unc-51 must act through other pathways as well. In mammalian cells Unc-51 can downregulate ERK by inhibiting the binding of a scaffolding protein to the FGF receptor. To date, no receptor tyrosine kinase has been identified that regulates active zone formation in . Future studies to characterize the mechanism by which Unc-51 inhibits ERK in  motoneurons may provide clues toward identification of such a pathway. In addition, it is unclear how ERK regulates active zone formation. A previous study demonstrated that phospho-ERK localizes to the active zone, which would suggest a direct mechanism (Koh et al., 2002). Unfortunately, we have been unable to replicate these localization findings. The same study demonstrated that the transgenic expression of a constitutively active  or a gain-of-function ERK allele both lead to an increase in the number of synaptic boutons, which is not consistent with our finding of a smaller NMJ. Active zone structure and number were not assessed. We speculate that the global activation of ERK may result in different phenotypes than relief of Unc-51 inhibition of ERK, which could show temporal and spatial specificity.In mammalian and  neurons, release probability varies across release sites formed by a single neuron (Rozov et al., 2001; Marrus and DiAntonio, 2004). One potential mechanism would be the differential localization or activity of core active zone proteins. In , Bruchpilot is an excellent candidate for such a protein. It is required for the localization of calcium channels to the active zone, so changes in its localization or function would impact calcium influx and, hence, release probability at an active zone. The  mutant demonstrates that signaling pathways can differentially regulate the localization of Brp to individual release sites within a single neuron. As such, the Unc-51/Erk signaling pathway is a candidate mechanism to regulate active zone protein composition and release probability in a synapse-specific manner.This work was supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NS043171) to A.D.

However, the effect of reward and punishment on procedural learning is not known. The striatum is known to be an important locus of reward-related neural signals and part of the neural substrate of procedural learning. Here, using an implicit motor learning task, we show that reward leads to enhancement of learning in human subjects, whereas punishment is associated only with improvement in motor performance. Furthermore, these behavioral effects have distinct neural substrates with the learning effect of reward being mediated through the dorsal striatum and the performance effect of punishment through the insula. Our results suggest that reward and punishment engage separate motivational systems with distinctive behavioral effects and neural substrates.Reward and punishment are potent modulators of human and animal behavior (Thorndike, 1911; Pavlov, 1927; Skinner, 1938; Sutton and Barto, 1998). However, despite the great increase in knowledge in the past two decades of the neural basis of the reward effect (Schultz, 2002), and that of punishment to a lesser extent, we lack clear data about how reward and punishment influence the learning of specific behaviors, apart from those in classical and instrumental conditioning, and how this might be mediated at a neural level (Delgado, 2007). To address this issue, we focused on procedural learning, a distinct learning behavior that is the foundation of many of our motor skills and perhaps other functions such as cognitive, category, and perceptual learning (Squire, 2004). The fact that procedural learning is thought to be mostly dependent on the basal ganglia (Willingham et al., 2002), which also mediates the effect of reward and punishment (Schultz, 2002), makes it an ideal behavior to study.To test the influence of reward and punishment on procedural learning, we used a modified version of the serial reaction time (SRT) task (Nissen and Bullemer, 1987), a simple and robust experimental probe (Robertson, 2007), during which continuous modulation of motor output was required and reinforcement and nonreinforcement learning were dissociated. We opted to use monetary reward (and punishment) because it is a strong modulator of human behavior and has clear effects on brain activity (Breiter et al., 2001; Delgado et al., 2003). As in the original SRT task, subjects pressed one of four buttons with the right hand when instructed by a visual display. Trials were presented in blocks in which the lights were illuminated either randomly or, unbeknownst to the subject, on the basis of a 12-element repeating sequence. All subjects first performed several blocks of random trials to minimize the effects of learning the general visuomotor behavior on later blocks and to establish an individual criterion response time (cRT) on which subsequent reward and punishment would be based. Subjects were then randomly assigned to reward, punishment, and control groups. Because we used reaction time (RT) as an index of learning, subjects were, therefore, rewarded for faster responses, which were easiest to generate through learning the repeating sequence. To control for a potential distractor effect of the incentives on the learning process, several additional blocks without reward or punishment were presented after the trials with incentives. The blocks were presented in the order outlined in Figure 1,. In the current report, we describe the impact of reward and punishment behavioral results using a large cohort of subjects and the neural correlates of this behavior in a smaller number of different subject on whom functional imaging was also performed.In the behavioral study, we tested 91 healthy human subjects (69 female) (mean, 21.7 \u00b1 3.5 years); in the functional imaging component, we studied 41 right-handed subjects (22 female; 21 years \u00b1 2.58). All subjects were of similar socioeconomic backgrounds recruited from the University community and gave informed consent to participate in the study, which was approved by the local Institutional Review Board.The task (see Fig. 1) was a modification of the original SRT task of Nissen and Bullemer (1987). Subjects were presented with four visual stimuli arranged horizontally. Each stimulus was associated with one of the four fingers of the right hand; illumination of the visual stimulus indicated the finger to be moved. Subjects used a key-press device to respond as quickly as possible when instructed by the visual display. Stimuli were presented in blocks of 96 trials in either a pseudorandom or repeating 8- \u00d7 12-element sequence with an 800 ms interstimulus interval. To minimize awareness, the sequence was constrained (Willingham et al., 2000). Contrary to the original SRT task, random and sequence blocks were presented both with (R-blocks and S-blocks) or without (r-blocks and s-blocks) monetary incentives, respectively. For the purposes of the current experiment, we define reward and punishment in terms of positive and negative monetary incentives.Of the 91 original subjects, 25 subjects were excluded because they developed explicit knowledge of the sequence (see below), and a further two subjects were eliminated because they did not perform the test properly, leaving a cohort of 64 subjects. At the beginning of the experiment, subjects performed four practice r-blocks; we then calculated a cRT for each subject based on their median RT in the last of the four blocks. Subjects were then randomized into reward ( = 21), punishment ( = 24), and control ( = 19) groups. It is important to note, that because learning occurs implicitly in the SRT task, reward or punishment could not be applied directly in this paradigm. However, learning in the SRT task leads to faster reaction time, and this is usually used as a behavioral index of learning in this task. We therefore rewarded/punished subjects according to the change (increase/decrease) of their individual reaction time. Those in the reward group were informed that they would be rewarded (+ 4 cents) for each trial for which their RT was less then cRT; the penalty group were penalized (\u2212 4 cents) if their RT was greater than their cRT. Rewarded subjects started with $0, whereas punished group were given $38. Because of normalization of incentives to base performance, both rewarded and punished subjects ended up with an average of $21\u201322, whereas the control subjects received a fixed payment of $23. The incentive schedule also controlled for motivation in the two groups. Subjects received ongoing feedback of their performance both through an incrementing (or decrementing) counter displaying their current monetary position displayed on the screen and also by the color of the visual stimuli (green and red stimuli indicated that the RT on the preceding trial was less or greater than the cRT, respectively). Because learning of the sequence enabled subjects to reduce their RT significantly compared with the cRT, those in the reward group were rewarded for learning, whereas the penalty group were punished if they did not learn. Control subjects were presented with an equal number of red and green stimuli and told that the color was of no significance. To control for the potential distractor effect of the counter in the incentive groups, the controls saw an identical tally that kept a count of either red or green lights. After the initial practice session (four consecutive r-blocks), the full experiment comprised 15 blocks in the following order: r-R-R-R-R-S-S-S-S-R-S-r-r-s-r (, random blocks; S = sequence blocks; upper case, blocks with incentives in rewarded and punished groups; lower case, blocks without incentives). The color of the feedback visual stimuli was counter-balanced across subjects (supplemental Fig. S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Blocks were separated by 30 s breaks. Of the 64 subjects that are the basis of the behavioral component of the current report, the first 27 subjects performed only the first 11 blocks; the remaining four blocks were added later to measure the knowledge transfer in the absence of incentives.A different group of 41 (reward,  = 11; punished,  = 13; control,  = 17) subjects was used for the imaging experiment of whom 32 (reward,  = 11; punished,  = 13; control,  = 17) learned the sequence implicitly. The behavioral paradigm was identical to that of the behavioral experiment, with the exception of the monetary incentives which were adjusted as follows: the reward group started with $0 and was rewarded with 10 cents for every correct response; in the punished group, 20 cents were deducted for each incorrect response from a base of $95; the average final payment for the rewarded and punished groups was $55, which was also the fixed payment given to the control group.Immediately after performing both the behavioral and the imaging experiments, all subjects were tested for explicit knowledge of the sequence. The participants were told that the stimuli might have appeared in a repeating sequence and were asked to reproduce the sequence in a free recall task. They were allowed to use the key-press device if they thought it might be helpful. Subjects who could not recall anything were encouraged to guess. If a participant could reproduce a correct string of >4 consecutive items of the sequence, learning was considered to be explicit and the subject excluded from the analysis. We used a relatively conservative measure of explicit knowledge (Willingham and Goedert-Eschmann, 1999) to ensure that the effects described were primarily attributable to procedural knowledge. To limit the number of subjects excluded from the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis because of explicit learning, we used a slightly less conservative measure in this component of the experiment, and the learning was considered to be explicit if a subject could reproduce a correct string of >5 consecutive items of the sequence.Image acquisition was done with a 3 Tesla whole-body MR system (MAGNETOM Trio; Siemens Medical Systems) using a Siemens head coil. High-resolution (1 mm iso-voxel) T1-weighted-3d-FLASH sagittal sequences [160 slices per slab; field of view (FOV), 256 \u00d7 256 mm, repetition time (TR), 20 ms; echo time, 4.7 ms; flip angle, 22\u00b0; slice thickness, 1 mm] was first acquired to enable localization of functional images. Thereafter, whole-brain fMRI was performed using an echoplanar imaging sequence measuring blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal. A total of 30 functional slices per volume were acquired for all subjects in all runs. These slices had a thickness of 3 mm, and they were acquired in the transverse plane (matrix size, 64 \u00d7 64) FOV 192 \u00d7 192 mm, with a 33% gap. A complete scan of the whole brain was acquired in 2560 ms (TR), flip angle 80\u00b0, TE = 30 ms, and a total number of 611 volumes were acquired for the whole experiment.Brain Voyager (Brain Innovation B.V.) software was used for fMRI data preprocessing and analysis. The functional bidimensional images of every subject were preprocessed to correct for motion artifacts (movements <3 mm in any plane), for differences in slice scan time acquisition and for temporal linear trends. Then, these functional images were used to reconstruct the three-dimensional (3D) functional volume for every subject and every run. Next, we performed spatial smoothing of the functional data using a Gaussian full-width at half-maximum kernel of 7 mm. The 3D functional volume was subsequently aligned with the corresponding 3D anatomical volume, and both of them were normalized to standard Talairach space.Statistical analyses were done using SPSS 11.0. Response time gains in individual subjects were calculated by deducting the RT of each trial from the cRT for that subject. Because RT gains were negative values and not normally distributed, we added 1000 to each value and did a logarithmic transformation before any statistical calculations. However, when differences in RT or RT gains are stated or when displayed in graphs, the original, nontransformed scale was used. Generalized linear models (GLM) were used for comparison of different conditions among groups. The threshold for significance was 0.05 adjusted for multiple comparisons, if necessary. To determine the extent of learning in each of the three behavioral groups (reward, punishment, control), we used a custom orthogonal contrast between the sequence block (14) and surrounding random blocks (13 and 15) for which we used the following contrast weights: \u00bd, \u22121, \u00bd for blocks 13, 14, and 15, respectively.GLM models were used for voxelwise data analysis. A block design protocol was used to demonstrate the main effects. To determine the \u201ceffect of procedural learning\u201d in all subjects we regrouped the 15 blocks into four regressors [random and sequence, with (R,S) and without (r,s) incentive] and the baseline in rewarded and punished subject groups. To address the neural basis of the \u201cperformance effect\u201d we did an additional block-based analysis using a GLM that included each block (total 15) as an independent regressor and contrasted the first nonincentive block (r; block 1) with the first incentive block (R; block 2). An event-related protocol was used to assess the influence of incentives by testing the difference between trial types (rewarded, punished, control) and differences within types relating to the presence or absence of incentive. The event-related analysis was performed for blocks 2\u201311, and each behavioral event (800 ms) was classified according to our experimental manipulation (reward, punishment, or control) and the performance of the subject (green or red lights). These predictors were entered as fixed factors in a mixed GLM model, with subjects as random factors (to control for possible differences among subjects).The statistical parameters of these models were computed voxelwise for the entire brain, and activation maps were computed for various contrasts between the predictors. The criteria used for activation maps we generated were as follows: cluster size of 10 adjacent voxels (to demonstrate the performance effect, the cluster size was raised to 100 adjacent voxels) and a statistical threshold for the cluster of  < 0.001. The output of these models was selectively used for region of interest analysis both of the learning and the performance effects using SPSS.We performed two additional voxelwise analyses. The first analysis (supplemental Table S3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) was to determine the brain areas that related to the enhanced learning in the reward group (punished group as control). We first applied the main effects of the block design model as a mask (uncorrected,  < 0.05; voxels >108 mm3) within which we tested the interaction between learning and group ( = 3.174;  < 0.005; voxels >108 mm3); group was defined as reward/punishment and learning as sequence (S blocks)/baseline. The second analysis (supplemental Table S5, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) was to detect the functional activation associated with the performance effect in the punishment group. A GLM was built that included each block (total 15) as an independent regressor. The normalized cRT (mean, 0; SD, 1; only for first two blocks) was included in this model to determine the neural basis of the performance effect.As mentioned above, we first present the data from a behavioral study on a large cohort of subjects followed by the data from functional imaging on a different but smaller group performing the same task.In the behavioral study, we tested 91 subjects, of whom 25 developed explicit knowledge of the sequence and two did not perform the experiment properly and were excluded from further analyses. The remaining 64 subjects were divided among the reward ( = 21), punishment ( = 24), and control ( = 19) groups. Learning in the SRT task is generally assessed by RT gain, or in some cases by the error rate in sequence blocks compared with random blocks (Fig. 1). There were three main findings in the behavioral study. First, there was a strong non-learning-related performance effect in the punishment group. This effect was manifested by a sharp and significant (pairwise comparisons using Bonferroni test,  < 0.001) 19.6 ms drop in RT in the punishment group during random blocks immediately after the implementation of penalties (Fig. 1, blocks 1\u20135). Because there was no sequence to be learned, the RT decrease must have been caused by a pure performance effect provoked by punishment and not related to learning. A comparable effect was not seen in the reward group. The second finding was a differential learning effect in the three groups (group \u00d7 block interaction; (8,44128) = 3.39;  = 0.001) during the learning phase (Fig. 1, blocks 6\u20139). At the end of the sequence blocks, the reward and control groups showed a significantly greater (pairwise comparisons using Bonferroni test,  < 0.001) decrease in RT than the punishment group. However, the relatively modest RT gain in the punished group during sequence blocks may have been attributable to a floor effect as a result of the already low RT from improvement in performance in the preceding random blocks. To test for possible floor effects and also to eliminate potential distractor effects that might have unpredictable consequences on the expression of learning (Frensch et al., 1999), we added a transfer phase, without reward or punishment in 37 of the 64 subjects performing the task (Fig. 1, blocks 12\u201315). Using these transfer blocks, sequence learning was estimated by a custom orthogonal contrast between the sequence block (14) and surrounding random blocks (13 and 15) for which we used the following contrast weights: \u00bd, \u22121, \u00bd for blocks 13, 14, and 15, respectively. The results of this contrast showed that learning occurred in all groups. However, the reward group learned more than either of the other groups (RT savings: reward, 25.9 ms; control, 13.0 ms; punishment, 14.5 ms), and this difference (Fig. 1) was significant [((2,12232) = 6.07;  = 0.002; mean square error (MSE), 0.006], in which the 95% confidence interval of the rewarded group did not overlap with the confidence interval of either of the other two groups. Finally, the motivational effect of the incentives, based on a comparable speed\u2013error trade-off profile (Fig. 1), was similar in both groups but was different from that in the controls ((2,75795) = 126.19;  < 0.001; MSE, 0.092). The error rate, however, may also be used as an index of learning and, as expected, decreased during sequence blocks and showed the greatest decrease in the reward group in the transfer blocks (12\u201315), although this difference did not reach statistical significance.Behavioral results. , , Time course of response time gains () and error rates () in subject groups during task performance.

The mean (\u00b1SEM) of the absolute response gain in the transfer portion of the task (blocks 12\u201315) was derived by comparing RT in the sequence block (block 14) to the mean of the adjacent blocks (blocks 12,13, and 16) for each group. The difference between the reward and the other two groups was significant ( = 0.003). Error bars indicate SEM.The behavioral experiment, therefore, showed that only reward but not punishment enhances the implicit learning of sequences. This finding is at odds with previous studies of reward and punishment on learning, which, however, were generally confined to associative-learning tasks. This result provided us with an opportunity to test the neural substrate of the reward and punishment effects during procedural learning.We studied another group of naive subjects using fMRI during the performance of an almost identical behavioral task to the one described above and performed and detailed analysis on 41 subjects of whom 32 (reward,  = 10; punishment,  = 11; control,  = 11) did not acquire explicit knowledge of the sequence. Using data from the implicit learning cohort, we confirmed the previous behavioral results (supplemental Fig. S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Specifically, we found a differential learning effect in the three groups (group \u00d7 block interaction; (6,11145) = 2.42;  = 0.024) during the learning phase. The greatest RT gain occurred in the rewarded, followed by the punished and control groups (pairwise comparisons using Bonferroni test,  < 0.001). The rewarded group had a gain of 27.12 ms, whereas the punished and control groups had significantly smaller, but similar gains (13.84 ms and 15.13 ms, respectively). These results suggest that the rewarded group learned more than either of the other groups when provided with incentives. There was a strong non-learning-related performance effect of incentive in the punished and rewarded groups when the random blocks with incentive were compared with those without (interaction effect: (8,13966) = 8.15;  < 0.001). Similar to the purely behavioral study, the imaged subjects who were punished showed the greatest RT gain (29.16 ms) when compared with the other two groups (pairwise comparisons using Bonferroni test,  < 0.001). However, the rewarded group also showed significantly greater RT gains compared with the control group (17.14 ms vs 4.9 ms), albeit smaller than those of the punished group (pairwise comparisons using Bonferroni test,  < 0.001).For the functional imaging analysis, we first examined the neural substrate of reward and punishment in all subjects over the whole experiment by comparing activation in the trials with and without incentives, separately for the reward and punishment groups (Fig. 2; supplemental Table S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) and focused primarily on subcortical activation. This contrast yielded an increase in activation in the dorsal striatum, in the nucleus accumbens, and amygdala, as well as in prefrontal cortex in the rewarded group (Fig. 2,). The punished group, as might be expected, showed quite a different pattern with increased activation during the punished trials in the insula bilaterally (Fig. 2) and in portions of prefrontal cortex. Interestingly, the lack of punishment was associated with a relative increase in activation in the reward-related portions of the dorsal striatum. The comparison of activation associated with the randomly presented red and green stimuli in the control group showed no subcortical activation.Effect of reward and punishment on brain activity. , , Event-related averaging in the rewarded group ( = 11); when rewarded trials (green stimuli) were compared with trials without reward (red stimuli), there was significant ( < 0.001) activation in the striatum on both sides as well as the nucleus accumbens on the left. , Trials with punishment compared with trials without in the punished group ( = 13) result in a decreased BOLD signal in the striatum bilaterally (activation above baseline during neutral stimuli) and an increase in the insula bilaterally. There was no activation in these regions comparing red and green stimuli (both without incentives) in the controls ( = 17).We next determined the areas responsible for procedural learning in all subjects (across groups) by comparing the activity during sequence blocks to the activity during random blocks. This analysis showed a significant increase in BOLD signal during the learning phase in the putamen bilaterally (Fig. 3,) as well as in the pontine gray matter and in the dentate nucleus on the ipsilateral side (supplemental Table S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) indicating that these areas are implicated in the procedural learning process. To evaluate the effect of incentives more specifically in these areas important for procedural learning, we plotted (Fig. 3), for each implicit learning group separately, the changes in the BOLD signal in the putamen (left and right combined) during the following three trial types: (1) trials in which no incentive was possible (named \u201cneutral\u201d during r and s blocks), (2) incentive trials in R and S blocks (green trials for rewarded and red for punished group), and (3) nonincentive trials during R and S blocks (red trials for rewarded and green for punished group). We then analyzed the BOLD signal in these ROIs using a GLM model with group (control, rewarded, punished) and color of the stimulus (neutral, green, red) in the current trial as independent factors. Pairwise comparisons between various groups were assessed using Sidak tests, adjusting for the number of multiple comparisons. We found a significant main effect of group ((2,1016) = 32.59; <0.001; MSE, 0.093), color of the stimulus ((2,1016) = 18.17;  < 0.001; MSE, 0.093) and a significant interaction effect ((2,1016) = 4.41;  < 0.001; MSE, 0.093) between the independent factors. Sidak tests for pairwise comparisons showed that, overall, the BOLD signal change in the putamen was different in all three groups: it was the highest for the rewarded group, followed by controls and then by the punished group (all differences significant at  < 0.05, adjusted for multiple comparisons). In the rewarded group, there was a significant increase in BOLD signal (Sidak test significant at  < 0.001) for trials that were rewarded compared with nonrewarded trials or those in which no reward (incentive) was possible. In the punished group, the BOLD signal change during incentive trials (i.e., punishment; red stimuli) was not different from neutral trials (Sidak test,  = 0.386), but it was significantly less (Sidak test,  < 0.005) than that during nonincentive trials (green trials). It can be seen that the color of the stimulus had no effect on striatal activation in the control group. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the BOLD signal during nonincentive trials between control and rewarded groups (red trials) or between control and punished groups (green trials), indicating a stable baseline activation when executing the task without incentives. We further confirmed the findings of this RO1 approach using a voxel-based analysis of the interaction between learning and group (supplemental Table S3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). The voxelwise analysis also showed an interaction effect in the middle frontal gyrus in an area consistent with the location of dorsal premotor cortex, which suggests that the effect we documented in basal ganglia is transmitted to the cortex thus facilitating changes in motor output.Activation in areas critical for procedural learning. , , A comparison of sequence blocks with random blocks over all groups in all subjects with implicit learning ( = 41) showed a significant ( < 0.001, uncorrected) increase in activation during motor learning in the corpus striatum (putamen and globus pallidus) bilaterally. , More specific analysis of the striatal region in each group during implicit learning showed that in the rewarded group there was a significant ( < 0.001; Sidak tests adjusted for multiple comparisons) change in BOLD signal during trials in which subjects were rewarded (purple bar) compared with nonrewarded trials (gray bar) or trials in which no reward could be obtained (black bar). In contrast, the BOLD signal in the punished group during punished trials (purple bar) and nonpunished trials (gray bar) did not significantly diverge from that during trials in blocks where no punishment could be obtained (black bar). The difference between trials with punishment and trials without punishment is, however, significant ( < 0.005; Sidak tests adjusted for multiple comparisons). The trials in the control group show that there was no effect of stimulus color (square on each bar). The color of the visual stimulus for particular trial types is indicated at the midpoint of each bar. Error bars show the 95% confidence interval.Although in the behavioral experiment punishment showed no effect on the process of learning, it led to an immediate performance effect expressed by a decrease in reaction time immediately after the introduction of punishment (Fig. 1) during the random blocks. To examine the neural substrate of this performance effect, we compared the BOLD response in the last block of random stimuli without incentives to the first block with incentives (supplemental Table S4, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). In the punished group, this contrast showed an increase in activation in the insula, and in the inferior frontal gyrus and hippocampus, in addition to other areas (Fig. 4). Among the areas activated in this contrast, only the change in activation in the insula was correlated (Pearson  = \u22120.54;  < 0.005;  = 26) with the performance change in punished subjects. Although the rewarded subjects also showed a performance effect, this did not correlate with changes in insula activation (Pearson  = 0.001; =0.997;  = 22). We confirmed the performance-related activation of the insula in a separate voxelwise analysis (supplemental Table S5, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).Neural substrate of change in performance. , Activation in right insula, in punished subjects only, after the contrast between block 2 (R) random, with incentives (green and red stimuli combined), and block 1 random (r), without incentives. Statistical threshold was (12) \u2265 5.7 with a minimum cluster size of 100 voxels (1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm resolution). , , The correlation between changes in BOLD signal and reaction time relative to cRT for both blocks 1 and 2 combined for the rewarded () and the punished () groups. In each panel, each subject has a pair of points, one from block 1 and one from block 2.Our results point to fundamental differences between the effects of reward and punishment on behavior and to their quite distinct neural substrates. In addition, we extend the relevance of reward-based learning in the basal ganglia to the learning of habits (Packard and Knowlton, 2002) and skills and sequences (Houk et al., 1995; Berns and Sejnowski, 1998; Suri and Schultz, 1998).The first issue to consider is whether reward and punishment have similar effects on behavior. We designed the opponent behaviors in our experiment as they might be constructed in every day life. Our objective was to encourage fast responses to the visual stimuli; therefore, we rewarded the desired behavior in one group and punished the undesired behavior in another. Both manipulations had a measurable effect on behavior, and deciding which is preferable depends on whether one is interested in short term changes in performance without enhancement of learning or longer term changes in learning itself. Only the reward group showed enhanced implicit learning of the motor sequence, although the punished group also learned they did not do any better than the control subjects. The lack of an effect of punishment on learning, although there were clear effects on other aspects of behavior (Fig. 1), was surprising and would not necessarily have been predicted on the basis of the reinforcement learning literature. B. F. Skinner regarded punishment as a \u201cquestionable technique,\u201d speculated as to whether it actually worked, and stressed the fact that even when it did, its effects tended to be short lived (Skinner, 1953). Of course, we recognize that our results are only directly applicable to procedural learning paradigms and may well not generalize to the very wide range of behaviors for which reward and punishment are used as modulators. Nevertheless, procedural learning is an important aspect of learning, and the data we present might well be applicable to the rehabilitation of motor function in patients with various forms of motor disability including those after a stroke.The second question is whether our results tell us anything about the interaction among positive and negative incentives (reward and punishment), motivation, and learning. Although this issue has been dealt with extensively in the literature on Pavlovian conditioning (Dickinson and Balleine, 2002) it has not been clear whether reward and punishment interact with separate motivational systems that have different neurochemical and neuroanatomical substrates and produce differential behavioral effects (Bindra, 1974; Dickinson and Dearing, 1979; Dayan and Balleine, 2002), and the question has never been addressed in the context of implicit procedural learning. The behavioral task we used enabled us to separate the effects of reward and punishment on motor performance from those on motor learning. The fact that there were qualitatively distinct effects on these behavioral measures suggests that reward and punishment may actually engage qualitatively different motivational systems. However, it is not clear whether there were quantitative differences in motivation between these groups. The similarity of the RT-error trade-off in both groups (Fig. 1) might be interpreted as indicating similar motivation; however, a more parsimonious explanation is that they used similar criteria for this trade-off. The negativity bias (Taylor, 1991) in the decision-making literature would suggest that the motivation might be stronger in the punished group, given the equal monetary value of reward and punishment, making it all the more remarkable that the rewarded subjects clearly learned more. If reward and punishment actually access separate motivation systems, then one would expect that this should be evident in the underlying neural substrate. In the current study, the activity in the dorsal and ventral striatum that related to the reward per se replicates previous findings (McClure et al., 2003; O'Doherty et al., 2003, 2004) and most likely represents the neural correlate of the dopaminergic neurons coding a prediction error signal in addition to being consistent with the two process account of reinforcement learning (Montague et al., 1996; Sutton and Barto, 1998). In contrast, punishment led to activation predominantly in the inferior frontal gyrus and in the insula, the latter being the most consistently activated area in a variety of studies relating to punishment (Elliott et al., 2000; Sanfey et al., 2003; Daw et al., 2006). It has been hypothesized that punishment, even when it is associated with striatal activation (Seymour et al., 2004), does not operate through the dopaminergic system (Ungless et al., 2004) but is more likely mediated through the serotonergic system originating in the median raphe nucleus (Daw et al., 2002). The end result of activating such a motivational system in our case was the change in performance we documented with which the insula was the only area to be significantly correlated. The difference between the results of this and many other studies is that we were able to correlate the neural substrates of reward and punishment with qualitatively different behavior outcomes suggesting that these modulators might indeed operate through different motivational systems.The final issue to consider is how the results contribute to our knowledge of the role of the basal ganglia in procedural learning. There is a general consensus that the basal ganglia are an important substrate for procedural learning (Grafton et al., 1995; Rauch et al., 1997; Willingham et al., 2002), particularly when learning becomes more established (Poldrack et al., 2005; Seidler et al., 2005). The location of activation associated with learning in the current study, the dorsal striatum (putamen), is similar to that identified by others (Poldrack et al., 2005; Seidler et al., 2005). The dorsal striatum is involved in learning stimulus\u2013action\u2013reward associations during instrumental learning (Haruno et al., 2004; O'Doherty et al., 2004). In our experiment, the association between stimulus and action was deterministic; therefore, the activity in the putamen cannot be related to learning the stimulus\u2013action association. Similarly, because activity in the putamen was higher in the sequence compared with the random blocks regardless of reward delivery, this activity is not solely related to action\u2013reward association. Our data suggest that reward facilitates procedural motor learning within the motor system by modulating the activity of the putamen which has extensive connections to premotor areas. It is likely that the effect is translated into an improvement in motor learning by a dopamine-induced potentiation of corticostriatal synapses in the striatum, similar to that which occurs after direct stimulation of the substantia nigra (Reynolds et al., 2001). In the same context, our results may also be relevant to patients with Parkinson disease, who show some deficits in procedural learning tasks, but who are disabled primarily because of an inability to produce coherent sequences of over-learned movements. It is possible that the lack of dopamine in these patients results in an impairment of an intrinsic reward system (Mazzoni et al., 2007), based on an internal representation of motor performance, thus disrupting the type of corticostriatal facilitation we demonstrated, and thereby affecting the performance of sequential movements.This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) Grant NS40106 (J.A. and D.T.W.), NIH Center Grant P41RR008079, and the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Target disconnection by axotomy produces an initial synaptic stripping ensued by synaptic rearrangement upon target reinnervation. Using abducens motoneurons of the oculomotor system as a model for axotomy, we report that trophic support by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) or a mixture of both, delivered to the stump of severed axons, results in either the prevention of synaptic stripping when administered immediately after lesion or in a promotion of reinnervation of afferents to abducens motoneurons once synaptic stripping had occurred, in concert with the recovery of synaptic potentials evoked from the vestibular nerve. Synaptotrophic effects, however, were larger when both neurotrophins were applied together. The axotomy-induced reduction in firing sensitivities related to eye movements were also restored to normal values when BDNF and NT-3 were administered, but discharge characteristics recovered in a complementary manner when only one neurotrophin was used. This is the first report to show selective retrograde trophic dependence of circuit-driven firing properties  indicating that NT-3 restored the phasic firing, whereas BDNF supported the tonic firing of motoneurons during eye movement performance. Therefore, our data report a link between the synaptotrophic actions of neurotrophins, retrogradely delivered, and the alterations of neuronal firing patterns during motor behaviors. These trophic actions could be responsible, in part, for synaptic rearrangements that alter circuit stability and synaptic balance during plastic events of the brain.Neurotrophins provide part of the molecular background that promotes both synaptogenesis and stabilization of existing synapses in the adult brain, and therefore are crucial for plastic events such as regeneration or learning and memory (Vicario-Abej\u00f3n et al., 2002). These neurotrophin-mediated trophic effects, mostly studied , include the regulation of the number, composition and activity of synapses (McAllister et al., 1999; Mendell et al., 1999), as well as the regulation of firing patterns (Zhou et al., 2005; Youssoufian and Walmsley, 2007). Nonetheless, given the diversity of synaptic organization in the adult brain and the patterns of distribution of neurotrophins and receptors, an  approach is required for ascertaining their specific roles under physiological conditions (Schinder and Poo, 2000; Caleo et al., 2003).Lack of retrograde trophic support induced by axotomy in the adult CNS produces a profound synaptic stripping that decreases the motoneuronal responsiveness to afferent signals (Titmus and Faber, 1990). These alterations normally revert when target reinnervation is allowed to occur or when a new target is provided (Ben\u00edtez-Temi\u00f1o et al., 2005). The sequence of events for neurotrophins as target-derived factors is established. Neurotrophins are produced by muscle cells (Steljes et al., 1999; Omura et al., 2005) and then retrogradely and transsynaptically transported by motoneurons (Rind et al., 2005) that are endowed with neurotrophin receptors (Ben\u00edtez-Temi\u00f1o et al., 2004). Retrograde neurotrophin uptake and transport increases after nerve injury (Curtis et al., 1998), and neurotrophin signaling reaches the soma which influences cellular functions by different effectors and transcriptional pathways (Zweifel et al., 2005). The abducens motoneurons of the oculomotor system have firing patterns and afferent synaptic connectivity well correlated to the parameters of eye movement (Delgado-Garcia et al., 1986), and, thus, can be used to test whether firing and synaptic properties can be modulated by extrinsic trophic support after target-disconnection by means of axotomy.If neurotrophins play a causal role, as target-derived factors, in regulating the discharge characteristics via alterations of the synaptic composition, manipulations that either decrease or increase neurotrophin supply should result in altered firing and neuronal sensitivities. Here, to test this prediction, we administered brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and/or neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) to the stump of the severed axons of abducens motoneurons. Thus, we sought to challenge the synaptic stripping by two ways. We either prevented it by neurotrophin treatment starting at the moment of the lesion or promoted afferent reinnervation once the synaptic stripping had occurred. We also found a complementary role of BDNF and NT-3 in regulating the balance of tonic and phasic discharge properties of motoneurons, respectively, that could be causally related to the restoration of synaptic connectivity. This firing restoration could be prevented by the blockade of the neurotrophin receptor signaling with K252a, which resembles the effects of axotomy on discharge properties of motoneurons. Our data demonstrate that during synaptic remodelling, NT-3 and BDNF play trophic effects on synaptic inputs to motoneurons being NT-3 specific for phasic inputs and BDNF selective for tonic inputs.Experiments were conducted on adult cats weighing 2.0\u20132.5 kg obtained from authorized breeders (Universidad de C\u00f3rdoba, C\u00f3rdoba, Spain). Animals were either prepared for the chronic recording of eye movements and neuronal extracellular recordings in the abducens nucleus ( = 12) or those for histology were simply instrumented for the chronic delivery of neurotrophins ( = 10). Surgical and handling procedures for chronic and acute experiments followed the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health (http://oacu.od.nih.gov) and the specific recommendations for the preparation and maintenance of higher mammals during neuroscience experiments (NIH publication #94-3207, 1994) and were in accordance with national legislation for the use and care of laboratory animals (R.D. 120/2005 BOE 252/34367-91, 2005).Animals were surgically prepared for chronic recordings of eye movements and the electrical activity of abducens nucleus neurons. After a protective injection of atropine sulfate (0.5 mg/kg, i.m.) to reduce vagal reflexes, the animal was anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (35 mg/kg, i.p.) and placed in a stereotaxic frame. Surgery was then performed under sterile conditions to implant stimulating electrodes, scleral coils, and the recording chamber. Two silver bipolar electrodes were implanted (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) to stimulate the left VIth nerve at its exit from the brainstem and the right medial longitudinal fascicle (MLF) next to the oculomotor nucleus. Coils, made up of 2 turns of Teflon-insulated stainless-steel wire, were implanted in the sclera of both eyes. A square-shaped window (5 \u00d7 5 mm) was drilled in the occipital bone to allow transcerebellar access to the brainstem with glass micropipettes during the recording sessions. A recording chamber made of acrylic resin was constructed around the window, which was sealed between recording sessions. Finally, a pedestal made of dental acrylic with embedded bolts was constructed to immobilize the head during the recordings. Postoperative care was provided to ensure the healthy state of the animal.After 10\u201315 d of postoperative recovery, recording sessions started. The animal was restrained with elastic bandages, and placed in a Plexiglas box inside the scleral coil frame. Both the micromanipulator and the head-restraining device were located inside the coil frame. Eye movements were recorded by means of the magnetic field search-coil technique (Fuchs and Robinson, 1966). Eye coils were calibrated by rotating at known angles the magnetic field frame relative to the cat.Extracellular recordings were performed with glass micropipettes beveled to a resistance of 1\u20132 M\u03a9 and filled with 2 m NaCl. The (left) abducens nucleus was approached stereotactically and located with the aid of the antidromic field potential produced by electrical stimulation of the VIth nerve. Abducens motoneurons were identified by their antidromic activation from the VIth nerve and by the collision test between the spontaneously occurring orthodromic and antidromically evoked action potentials. Abducens internuclear neurons were identified from the electrode implanted in the MLF. The extracellular neuronal activity was amplified and filtered at a bandwidth of 10 Hz\u201310 kHz for display and digitalization purposes.Horizontal and vertical eye position of both eyes and neuronal activity were digitally stored for off-line analysis using a digitizing card (Power 1401, Cambridge Electronics Design). Computer programs were written in Matlab 6.5 to display the histogram of instantaneous firing frequency of the neuronal discharge (i.e., the reciprocal of the interval between two adjacent spikes) and the position of both eyes, and to select data between cursors. Relationships between neuronal firing rate (FR) (in spikes/s) and horizontal eye position (EP) (in degrees) were obtained by linear regression analysis to calculate the slope, i.e., the neuronal sensitivity to eye position () (in spikes/s/degree), and the intercept (\n0) (in spikes/s), i.e., the neuronal firing rate at straight-ahead gaze. Firing rate during fixations responded to the equation FR =  \u00b7 EP + \n0. Relationships between neuronal firing and eye velocity during spontaneous saccades were also obtained by linear regression analysis after subtraction of the position component ( \u00b7 EP) calculated from the previously known sensitivity to eye position. Thus, the equation used was FR \u2212  \u00b7 EP =  \u00b7 EV + \n0, where  (in spikes/s/degree/s) is the neuronal sensitivity to eye velocity (EV) (in degrees/s). Due to the impairment of eye movements of the affected eye, we used for computations the eye movement of the contralateral eye.Four animals were additionally implanted with silver bipolar electrodes in the vestibular nerve bilaterally (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) during either the main surgical procedure or in a second surgical session. Single pulse electrical stimulation to the vestibular nerve with currents <50 \u03bcA produced typical extracellular field potentials in the abducens nucleus (Pastor et al., 1997) that were positive or negative-positive for the ipsilateral stimulation and mainly negative for stimulation applied to the contralateral vestibular nerve. One or more wavelets representing the afferent volley of activated presynaptic axons were typically seen at short latency after the stimulus artifact. To record extracellular field potentials, filters were set at DC-10 KHz. For constructing the peristimulus time histograms (PSTH), we generated binned histograms (bin width 0.5 ms) spanning 20 ms before and 50 ms after the stimulus for 200\u2013400 cycles of stimulation applied to either the contralateral or the ipsilateral vestibular nerves. The Schmidt-trigger pulse obtained from action potentials was used to construct the PSTH and the stimulus artifact pooled at the time 0 bin, but excluded from computations. The intensity applied was 1.1\u00d7 the current threshold necessary to evoke a detectable eye movement (Baker et al., 1981; Pastor et al., 1997). Neuronal responses were normalized to calculate the -scores of a normal probability distribution to detect those bins that were statistically different from the mean of the response previous to the stimulus artifact. The contralateral nerve stimulation produced a facilitatory response within the 4\u20135 ms that followed the electrical stimulus onset. The ipsilateral stimulation produced a disfacilitation of the basal firing at the same latency. To quantify PSTH, the area above or below mean before the stimulus application was computed to compare responses among experimental groups.For the delivery of neurotrophins, we implanted the stump of the abducens nerve in a custom-made chamber to control the milieu that bathed it and to prevent axonal reinnervation of any orbital structure or other extraocular muscles (Delgado-Garc\u00eda et al., 1988). The intraorbitary device consisted of a chamber that had two pieces of tubing inserted for fluid replacement and two electrodes as we recently described (Davis-L\u00f3pez de Carrizosa et al., 2008). The chamber was made with a standard polypropylene pipette tip shortened to \u223c15 mm and thus having conical shape. The wider side of the cone had inserted the tip of two 6-cm long pieces of thin wall polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (26 gauge; Small parts). The electrodes for electroneurographic recordings at the stump of the severed nerve were two PTFE insulated pieces, 6 cm long, 1 mm bare tip, made of multistranded stainless steel (located inside the chamber) and a single stranded silver wire (330 \u03bcm outer diameter) located outside of the chamber that served as reference electrode (A-M Systems). The tubing and the inside electrode were glued in place to the wide side of the chamber. The narrow part of the conical chamber was left opened to \u223c1 mm wide to fit tightly the stump of the abducens nerve.After a few control recording sessions to locate the abducens nucleus, the intraorbitary device was implanted under general anesthesia in a second surgical procedure. The orbit was approached temporally through a skin incision in the eyelid canthus at the left side. The abducens nerve was dissected free and the lateral rectus muscle removed. The distal end of the abducens nerve was inserted in the chamber by applying suction through the tubing system. The electrodes and tubing were passed under the skin and were affixed with dental acrylic to the head restraining system. A connection socket was used to solder the electrodes and a plastic chamber with a knuckled cap to protect the tubing endings. The total volume of the system was \u223c10\u201315 \u03bcl including the dead space of the inlet and outlet tubing.The protocol for neurotrophin delivery consisted of single injections of 15 \u03bcl in the nerve chamber on alternate days during 4\u20136 weeks of a solution at a concentration of 15 \u03bcg/\u03bcl in saline. During the recording session, the chamber was rinsed with sterile saline and followed by the injection in the chamber of a dose of NT-3, BDNF or a mixture or both neurotrophins. The concentrations we used were in accordance with the doses used in studies  (Mendell et al., 1999, Novikov et al., 2000). The selective inhibitor of the tyrosine protein kinase activity, K252a, was delivered at the concentration of 100 nm dissolved in saline with 2% dimethylsulfoxide and the mixture of both neurotrophins (Tapley et al., 1992). Finally, vehicle treatment consisted in the administration alone of sterile saline. Administration of neurotrophins either started the same day of axotomy [immediate administration protocol (IAP)] or delayed 15 d after the axotomy day [delayed administration protocol (DAP)].Animals were perfused intracardially with physiological saline followed by 4% phosphate buffer paraformaldehide. The brainstem at the abducens nucleus level was cut at 50-\u03bcm-thick coronal sections on a vibratome. The sections were washed in 0.01 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with 0.9% saline and containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBS/TX) and then blocked with normal horse serum (1:10 in PBS/TX) and placed in different mixtures of primary antisera overnight at room temperature. Dual or triple color immunofluorescence for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) (for motoneurons), synaptophysin (SYN) (for synaptic boutons) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (for astrocytes) was performed by mixing the following primary antibodies and dilutions: ChAT [goat polyclonal antibody (pAb); 1:300; Millipore], SYN (rabbit pAb; 1:500; Zymed Laboratories) and GFAP [mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) 7a; 1:800; Sigma]. To determine which fraction of the boutons was inhibitory, a series of experiments used the marker vesicular GABA/glycine transporter (VGAT) (Dumoulin et al., 1999; Gonz\u00e1lez-Forero et al., 2004), which is the vesicular \u03b3-aminobutyric acid transporter also known as vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (VIAAT) that transports GABA and glycine into synaptic vesicles (rabbit pAb; 1:500, Millipore). Labeling of terminals with vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 (VGLUT1 and VGLUT2) (guinea pig pAb; 1:300\u20131:1000; Millipore) yielded very low number of boutons on abducens motoneurons and no further attempts to characterize them were done. After several washes, the sections were incubated for 2\u20133 h in mixtures of secondary antibodies. Immunofluorescence was visualized with donkey anti-rabbit IgG coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or Cy2, donkey anti-goat IgG coupled to FITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate or Cy3 and donkey mouse IgG coupled Cy5 (The Jackson Laboratory). Secondary antibodies were diluted 1:50 in PBS/TX. Finally, sections were washed in PBS and mounted on glass slides and coversliped with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories).Confocal microscopy (Leica; TCS SP2) at higher magnification (\u00d763 oil immersion digitally zoomed at \u00d72) was used to sequentially capture images at the same focal plane by means of different filters and later merged in Sigma scan or Image J (NIH). Gray scales were adjusted to expand the maximum dynamic range of the image. Neurons included in the quantitative analysis were randomly sampled at high magnification (\u00d763) in 1\u20134 different focal planes separated by 2\u20133 \u03bcm in the -axis around the nuclear plane. Synaptophysin or VGAT boutons were counted to calculate the linear density of boutons. The synaptic coverage was also measured as the percentage ratio between the perimeter occupied by synaptophysin-inmunoreactive (IR), VGAT-IR terminals or GFAP-IR profiles over the ChAT-positive somata of motoneurons was also measured. Mean gray value as a measurement of the optical density of the section was also measured using square boxes of 30.4 \u03bcm side (80 pixels side) sampled through the neuropil of images captured at \u00d740. This measurement was considered as an index of the intensity of immunolabeling in the abducens nucleus and computed as the average gray value within the selection after background level subtraction. That is, the sum of the gray values of all the pixels (8-bit resolution) in the selection divided by the number of pixels. For comparisons between groups, one-way ANOVA at an overall level of significance of  < 0.05 followed by  comparisons were performed in SigmaStat version 3.1.Using the axotomy model of the well characterized abducens motoneurons, we tested the hypothesis that target-derived neurotrophic support modulates in adult motoneurons their synaptic composition and firing patterns. Axotomy leads to a profound reorganization of inputs to motoneurons that undergo stripping of synaptic boutons rendering these cells to a very plastic mode that helped us to test the synaptotrophic actions of neurotrophins.Control abducens neurons maintained a tonic and regular discharge during eye fixations. Their firing rate increased monotonically for ocular fixations at successive higher angular positions directed toward the ipsilateral side of recording (the on-direction; leftward or temporal-directed for a left-side recorded motoneuron), and decreased or eventually ceased as the eye adopted more eccentric eye positions in the off-direction (Fig. 1\n). The slope of the linear regression line between the firing rate and the eye position allowed us to calculate the neuronal sensitivity to eye position (measured in spikes/s/deg) (Fig. 1\n, circles). Motoneuronal activity was also related to eye velocity during saccades, thus motoneurons displayed high-frequency bursts during on-directed saccades or pauses preceding off-directed saccades (Fig. 1\n). The slope of the linear regression analysis between firing rate and eye velocity was the sensitivity to eye velocity, namely  (in spikes/s/deg/s).Effects of VIth nerve axotomy on the discharge properties of abducens neurons with prevented regeneration and reinnervation of a target. \n\n, Firing profile of a control abducens motoneuron during spontaneous eye movements.

Note reduced firing during both saccades and spontaneous fixations. \n\n, Abducens internuclear neurons always showed a normal firing pattern after lesion of the lateral rectus nerve. \n\n, Calculation of eye position sensitivity for the motoneurons shown in \n\n and \n\n. The slopes of the regression lines are the neuronal sensitivity to spontaneous eye movements (; in spikes/s/deg). Linear relationships were FR = 6.4 EP + 62.6 for the control (circles;  = 0.92;  < 0.001), and FR = 2.7 EP + 1.0 (dots;  = 0.9;  < 0.001) for the axotomized motoneuron. \n\n, Same as \n\n, but for eye velocity sensitivity. Linear relationships were FR' = 0.74 EP + 64.2 for the control ( = 0.87;  < 0.001), and FR' = 0.34 EP + 3.0 (dots;  = 0.8;  < 0.001) for the axotomized motoneuron. \n\n, \n\n, Time course of changes in  and  sensitivities after axotomy. Asterisks indicate significant differences with the control value (ANOVA test, Holm-Sidak method for  comparisons,  < 0.01).The firing pattern of abducens motoneurons (Fig. 1\n), but not internuclear neurons (Fig. 1\n), was dramatically changed after lesion of the VIth nerve. Changes appeared gradually during the first week that followed lesion and were permanent and more noticeable throughout the second week and continued so during the entire course of the experiment (8\u201310 weeks). During the initial 15 d postlesion, axotomized motoneurons showed an overall reduction in firing rate. Motoneurons were accompanied also by a severe reduction of modulation related to eye position and velocity (Fig. 1\n). Changes in the neuronal sensitivity to eye movement were noticed as reductions in the slopes between firing rate and both eye position and eye velocity (Fig. 1\n,, dots). Plotting the time course of changes in these two neuronal sensitivities ( and ) during axotomy revealed significant differences with control by 2 weeks after lesion (Fig. 1\n,). We used 15 d as a time border between two administration protocols of neurotrophins, because it is known that during these initial 15 d, motoneurons undergo a profound synaptic stripping (our data, see below) (Delgado-Garcia et al., 1988). Thus, if neurotrophins were administered immediately after the axotomy, we hypothesized that synaptic stripping could be, at least partly, prevented, and we termed this procedure the IAP. To the contrary, if synaptic stripping was allowed to occur during the 15 d that ensued axotomy, the subsequent neurotrophin administration would in turn facilitate the afferent reinnervation during the so-called DAP.Neurotrophin administration through the IOD directly into the nerve stump of the VIth nerve led to firing restoration in abducens motoneurons that could be appreciated as early as 48 h after treatment. Treatment with BDNF and NT-3 produced distinct changes in the firing pattern of motoneurons. Thus, while BDNF led to the restoration of the tonic firing (Fig. 2\n), NT-3, in turn, restored the bursting behavior of motoneurons (Fig. 2\n) (see Fig. 2\n for comparison with control), without altering in any case (during axotomy of the VIth nerve or during treatment with neurotrophins) the firing of abducens internuclear neurons (data not shown). Thus, BDNF and NT-3 produced complementary aspects of recovery in the firing of abducens motoneurons. BDNF treatment produced a significant recovery of the eye position sensitivity for both the immediate- and the delayed-administration protocols (Fig. 3\n). To the contrary, BDNF did not produce any recovery in the eye velocity sensitivity (Fig. 3\n) as bursts were of reduced amplitude (Fig. 2\n). Sorting the firing rate-to-eye position plots in those fixations obtained after on-directed saccades versus those obtained after off-directed saccades yielded two eye position sensitivities, -on and -off. Comparison of the results obtained indicated that both recovered to control values after BDNF or BDNF+NT-3, but not after NT-3 treatment (not illustrated).Complementary firing patterns of BDNF- and NT-3-treated motoneurons. \n\n, Control motoneurons burst for on-directed saccades and fire tonically during eye fixations. \n\n, Treatment with BDNF for 8 d immediately after axotomy reduced bursts in response to saccades. \n\n, Same as \n\n, but for a 7-d NT-3-treated cell displaying large bursts for saccades but reduced tonic firing for eye fixations. \n\n, Relationship between  and  sensitivities obtained by linear regression analysis for 75 control (blue), 45 BDNF-treated (red) and 51 NT-3-treated (green) motoneurons. The control population (blue) regression line was  = 0.095  + 0.32 ( = 0.63;  < 0.001), whereas the BDNF-treated population (red) showed a trend toward low  values, and thus the regression line was  = 0.045  + 0.32 ( = 0.48;  < 0.001). To the contrary, the NT-3 population (green) had higher  values, and the regression line was  = 0.164  + 0.36 ( = 0.71;  < 0.001). \n\n, Response of a motoneuron (gray firing rate) NT-3-treated for 14 d immediately after axotomy. The blue line represents the firing rate simulation obtained with the actual eye movement and the  value but determining the  parameter from the control population shown in \n\n. Arrows point to the decay in firing rate during fixations. \n\n, Response of a BDNF-treated motoneuron (gray) for 24 d demonstrating a tonic mode of firing. The blue line as in \n\n represents the simulated firing obtained with the actual eye movements and  but determining  from the control population shown in \n\n. The arrow points to the reduced bursts during saccades that are characteristic of BDNF-treated cells that, however, exhibit normal tonic firing.Quantitative effects in neuronal sensitivities induced by the neurotrophin treatments and blockade with K252a. \n\n, Eye position sensitivity expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM for 75 control motoneurons (dashed line and gray band represent mean \u00b1 SEM) and 65 axotomized motoneurons (stippled and light gray band). Up-directed bars and error bars represent the mean  values and SEM obtained for 45 (BDNF), 51 (NT-3) and 81 (BDNF+NT-3 labeled as NTs) motoneurons obtained after the IAP. The down-directed bars and error bars represent the mean  values and SEM obtained from 24 (BDNF), 31 (NT-3) and 44 (BDNF+NT-3) motoneurons obtained after the DAP. Asterisks represent statistically significant differences from control group. Note the recovery of  with BDNF or with the mixture of BDNF+NT-3 but not with NT-3. Dots represent statistically significant differences from axotomy group (ANOVA test, Holm-Sidak method for  comparisons,  < 0.01 for individual comparisons) \n\n, Same as \n\n, but for the eye velocity sensitivity. Equal number of cells and significance levels apply as in \n\n. Note recovery of eye velocity sensitivity () with NT-3 and BDNF+NT-3 but not the recovery with BDNF.A mirror-image pattern occurred after NT-3 administration; in essence, the bursting behavior recovered but not the tonic firing of the motoneuron during spontaneous fixations (Fig. 2\n). Quantification of the neuronal sensitivities for both the immediate and delayed administration protocols showed that the eye position sensitivity adopted an intermediate value, different from the axotomy value but different also from the control value (Fig. 3\n). However, the eye velocity sensitivity showed a dramatic recovery reaching an average value higher than control (Fig. 3\n) as motoneurons showed robust bursts during saccades (Fig. 2\n). This supranormal recovery of the eye velocity sensitivity resembled that found in the a-spinal motoneuron synaptic efficacy described by Mendell et al. (1999) when using NT-3 in axotomized and also in control motoneurons.Plotting of the eye velocity versus eye position sensitivity in control motoneurons demonstrated that a relationship existed and is described by the equation  = 0.095  + 0.32 ( = 0.63;  < 0.001). Thus, the larger the , the larger was the  value (Fig. 2\n, blue) with  being \u223c1/10th of the  value. As a consequence of the treatment with individual neurotrophins (BDNF or NT-3), the population scatterplot was above the control group after NT-3 treatment (Fig. 2\n, green), because they were dominated by higher  for a given  ( = 0.164  + 0.36;  = 0.71;  < 0.001). To the contrary, treatment with BDNF shifted the population scatterplot below the control group (Fig. 2\n, red) as they exhibited lower  sensitivities for a given  value ( = 0.045  + 0.32;  = 0.48;  < 0.001). This indicated that despite a robust relationship existing between  and  at the population level, the ratio between both parameters can be scaled as a consequence of the relative synaptic efficacy of both tonic and phasic inputs to the motoneurons depending on the trophic support used.We calculated the expected firing of motoneurons using the actual parameters of eye movement demonstrating marked contrasts with the actual firing recorded. Thus, treatment with NT-3 revealed that the expected firing of the motoneuron when using the actual  value (Fig. 2\n, blue lines), and the expected  value from the control group (Fig. 2\n, blue), demonstrated a deficit of firing rate during eye fixations (marked by down-directed arrows). In a complementary manner, the treatment with BDNF revealed that the expected bursts for a control motoneuron, having the actual  value of the treated cell but an extrapolated  value from the control population, were much larger than the actual firing recorded (Fig. 2\n, blue line, better seen in the inset). This discrepancy indicated a disbalance in the proportion of  to  values that scaled differently than in the control group.A series of experiments consisted in the simultaneous administration of both neurotrophins. As expected from their individual actions, the recovery was significant for both the eye position and the eye velocity sensitivities and for both types of protocol, either immediate or delayed administration after axotomy (Fig. 3\n,). Firing of motoneurons appeared balanced in burst and tonic modulation, as shown in Figure 4\n for an example of a motoneuron axotomized for 28 d and with the immediate trophic support. This result indicated that trophic restoration could be maintained for long-term after lesion and changes could also be seen in the electroneurographic recordings (Fig. 4\n, middle trace). The effects of the trophic support waned after administration ceased and motoneuron firing appeared again axotomy-like as well as the electroneurographic recording (Fig. 4\n). However, trophic support could be restored once the neurotrophin administration resumed and cells turned again into an apparently normal firing pattern with bursts and tonic discharges similar to controls (Fig. 4\n). Thus, the joint administration of BDNF and NT-3 restored the normal firing by scaling the appropriate sensitivities to eye position and velocity of axotomized abducens motoneurons. Removal of the trophic support by stopping the neurotrophin administration led neuronal sensitivities to return to the axotomy levels.Firing rate restoration induced by treatment with a mixture of BDNF and NT-3. \n\n, Motoneuron discharge pattern recorded 28 d after axotomy and BDNF+NT-3 treatment (immediate administration protocol). In \n\n, the eye position is shown in the top graph, the middle trace represents the electroneurogram recorded at the stump of the severed abducens nerve indicating that similar changes occurred in the whole nerve, and the bottom represents the instantaneous firing rate. \n\n, Another motoneuron recorded in the same animal but 14 d after suspending the neurotrophic support. Note that this cell was characterized by a low firing rate for both saccades and spontaneous fixations resembling the axotomy state. \n\n, Motoneuron recorded in the same animal but 14 d after resuming treatment showing the restoration of the discharge characteristics toward normal.We tested whether the actions of neurotrophins on abducens motoneurons were mediated via the signaling of Trk receptors by using the selective inhibitor of tyrosine kinase action K252a in the presence of a mixture of BDNF and NT-3. Recorded cells showed firing patterns that resembled axotomy when neurotrophins were applied together with the inhibitor from the distal end of sectioned axons (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). The eye position and eye velocity sensitivities under the action of K252a decayed to axotomized values. Motoneurons returned to either control values once the inhibitor was eliminated from the treatment or stayed within the axotomized range of values when administration of neurotrophins stopped.We tested synaptic potentials of vestibular origin in abducens motoneurons (Baker and Highstein, 1975; Delgado-Garc\u00eda et al., 1988; de la Cruz et al., 1994; Pastor et al., 1997). Extracellular synaptic potentials elicited from the ipsilateral vestibular nerve (inhibitory) were a positive wave indicative of hyperpolarizing action at the intracellular level. To the contrary, extracellular potentials elicited contralaterally (excitatory) were seen as a negative waves. As a result of axotomy, the vestibular potentials decreased in some cases almost completely although the presynaptic arrival of the afferent volleys were seen (Fig. 5\n, dots). Treatment with NT-3 produced a significant recovery of the ipsilateral\u2013inhibitory potentials (Fig. 5\n,), whereas treatment with BDNF produced mostly a recovery of contralateral\u2013excitatory\u2013synaptic potentials (Fig. 5\n,).Changes in synaptic potentials. \n\n, Extracellular field potentials recorded at the center of the abducens nucleus upon single pulse electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral (left side records) or the contralateral (right side records) vestibular nerve. In control (\n\n), the inhibitory input produces a positive extracellular wave, whereas the excitatory input produces a negative wave. During axotomy (\n\n), both waves are extremely reduced, but note, however, the presynaptic wavelets (dots) indicative of the afferent volley of presynaptic fibers reaching the abducens nucleus. Treatment with NT-3 (\n\n) restored the positive wave (inhibitory ipsilateral input), whereas BDNF treatment (\n\n) produced the selective recovery of the negative wave (excitatory contralateral input). \n\n, Summary of changes in mean amplitude of the field potentials for the different conditions. Mean and SEM are shown for 6\u201313 measurements taken between 6\u201312 d after treatment. Asterisks indicate significant differences with respect to control group (ANOVA test, Holm-Sidak method for  multiple comparisons;  < 0.01).We used these stimuli while recording abducens motoneurons in the awake animal to elicit changes in firing probability immediately after application of the stimulus, thus testing synaptic efficacy on treated motoneurons (Broussard et al., 1995). Electrical stimulation at 1.1\u00d7 the threshold for detecting eye movements directed toward the contralateral side resulted in transient changes of the discharge rate of abducens motoneurons, that once averaged, produced a characteristic pattern of facilitation and disfacilitation of the discharge rate produced by contralateral and ipsilateral stimuli, respectively (Fig. 6\n). For the majority of cells, 200\u2013300 stimuli were used to generate the PSTH. Figure 6, , shows the averaged response for each experimental condition using 13\u201317 cells in each group. Characterization of the bins that were significant using the -score statistics demonstrated that for the bins within the initial 4\u20135 ms of the response there was a significant facilitation (for contralateral stimulation) or disfacilitation of the response (for ipsilateral stimulation). We quantified the responses through the computation of the area above or below the mean response previous to the stimulation (Fig. 6\n, gray areas). Quantification of the results demonstrated that BDNF produced a significant recovery of the excitatory response (Fig. 6\n). Contrary to the results found with the extracellular field potentials, NT-3 did not produce a significant recovery of the ipsilateral\u2013inhibitory response, because the tonic resting level was low and the minimum response in a bin is zero, so the carving by inhibition of the PSTH response was not very conspicuous.Alterations by axotomy and neurotrophin treatment in abducens motoneuron responses to vestibular nerve electrical stimulation. \n\n, PSTHs constructed with 311 (contralateral) and 283 sweeps (ipsilateral), shown below in raster mode, that display 20 ms before the stimulus (stimulus artifact bin has been deleted from \n\n represented as a vertical dashed line) and 50 ms after the stimulus. Top PSTH indicates a firing facilitation peaking at 2.5 ms (arrow) upon contralateral stimulation, and the lower PSTH shows a firing disfacilitation that is maximal at 2 ms (arrow) after the ipsilateral stimulation. Bin width for PSTH is 0.5 ms. \n\n, PSTH for contralateral (top) and ipsilateral (bottom) vestibular nerve stimulation averaged for 13\u201317 responses of individual cells normalized to the number of sweeps. \n\n, Area measurement (in spikes) consisted in obtaining the number of counts (in spikes/s) times the bin width (in seconds) of the initial eight bins excluded the first one (\n\n) that were either higher, for contralateral stimulation, or lower, for ipsilateral vestibular stimulation than the mean firing of the 20 ms previous to the stimulus application (\n\n). \n\n, Quantification of the PSTH responses demonstrated a significant reduction in the area of the response for axotomized motoneurons and a significant recovery of the PSTH amplitude for contralateral vestibular stimulation after BDNF treatment. Asterisks indicate significant differences with control groups (ANOVA test; Holm-Sidak method for multiple comparisons;  < 0.01).The effects of neurotrophin administration to motoneurons studied during the vestibulo-ocular reflex demonstrated that (1) axotomy produced a decay of the neuronal sensitivities to eye position and velocity (supplemental Fig. 3,, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), (2) NT-3 produced the recovery of eye velocity sensitivity (supplemental Fig. 3,, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), (3) BDNF produced the complementary recovery of the eye position sensitivity (supplemental Fig. 3,, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), (4) the dual administration produced a full recovery of eye position and velocity sensitivities (supplemental Fig. 3,, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) that was (5) abolished by the inhibitor K252a (supplemental Fig. 3,, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).We found that the functional alterations of axotomy described here were directly related to the degree of synaptic stripping. To quantify these deficits of synaptic coverage, we performed immunohistochemistry for synaptophysin and GFAP which are markers for synaptic boutons and astrocytes, respectively. We also determined the fraction of inhibitory boutons by using immunostaining against VGAT. In the control abducens nucleus, the motoneurons were surrounded in a 48.1 \u00b1 1.8% of the somatic perimeter by synaptophysin-IR boutons and 20.1 \u00b1 1.1% of the perimeter was covered by astroglial filaments (Fig. 7, control; Fig. 8). Approximately 66% of the somatic boutons were VGAT-IR. The consequence of axotomy on surface coverage was that synaptophysin-IR bouton coverage dropped to 21.4 \u00b1 2.1% being a large proportion of boutons VGAT-positive, whereas astrocytic filaments proliferate around the somata and doubled coverage to 40.1 \u00b1 1.6% (Fig. 7, axotomy; Fig. 8\n). Treatment with the mixture of BDNF and NT-3 in the immediate administration protocol prevented the drop of synaptophysin-IR and VGAT-IR boutons (Fig. 8\n). An intermediate situation occurred by using a single neurotrophin, either BDNF (Fig. 7, BDNF; Fig. 8\n) or NT-3 (Fig. 7, NT-3; Fig. 8\n). In these cases the prevention of synaptic stripping produced intermediate results since coverage values were both different from control (thus, certain synaptic stripping still occurred) but also different from the axotomy values (Fig. 8\n). Neurotrophin treatment with either single neurotrophins or the mixture of two neurotrophins diminished in all cases the astrocytic reaction around the somata of motoneurons (Fig. 8\n).Neurotrophin involvement in prevention of synaptic stripping. \n\n, Confocal high-magnification images of motoneurons in control, axotomy, treated with BDNF, NT-3 and treated with BDNF+NT-3 (NTs) illustrating the synaptophysin innervation in green and the motoneuronal cell body in red (ChAT). All sections were obtained from animals after 15 d of axotomy alone or after treatment with neurotrophins in an immediate administration protocol. Note the marked reduction of boutons after 15 d of axotomy. \n\n, Same motoneurons and treatments as in \n\n but for GFAP coverage. Note an intense proliferation of astrocytic filaments surrounding the motoneuron somata. \n\n, Confocal images of VGAT labeling in ChAT identified motoneurons. \n\n, \n\n, Same as \n\n, \n\n, but for confocal low-magnification images illustrating the effects of treatments on boutons and glial filaments in the abducens nucleus neuropil. Scale bars: (\n\n)10 \u03bcm; (\n\n, \n\n) 40 \u03bcm.Prevention of synaptic stripping and promotion of reinnervation by neurotrophins. \n\n, Changes in synaptophysin-IR (green) and VGAR-IR (red) boutons in the abducens nucleus after axotomy and different treatments. Up-directed bars represent the percentage of covered perimeter of the motoneurons in control, axotomy, single neurotrophin treatment (BDNF or NT-3) and double neurotrophin treatment for either IAP or DAP. Down-directed bars correspond to measurements in the neuropil of the same variables. Bars represent mean \u00b1 SEM for 15\u201346 motoneuronal profiles in each group and 26\u201350 measurements in the neuropil. \n\n, Same as \n\n, but for measurements of GFAP-IR profiles around somata (up-directed bars) or in the neuropil (down-directed bars). Asterisks indicate significant differences with control, whereas dots indicate significant differences with axotomy. Two-way ANOVA, Holm-Sidak method for pairwise multiple comparisons ( < 0.01).Mean gray value, as a measure of optical density, measured in the neuropil produced a similar pattern of synaptic coverage with synaptophysin-IR and VGAT-IR profiles. The somatic coverage of motoneurons with GFAP was between the control and the axotomy values for the NT-3 treatment and showed a full recovery for the BDNF or the mixture of neurotrophins in the immediate administration protocol (Fig. 8\n). The GFAP-IR profiles, however, demonstrated that reactive astrocytes were present in the neuropil for all treatments; therefore, the recovery was partial for treatment with a single neurotrophin but recovery was more profound for treatment with the mix of both neurotrophins (Fig. 8\n). Thus, astrocytes were reactive as a consequence of the axotomy in the neuropil but locally withdrew from the surface of the motoneurons concomitantly with the lack of synaptic stripping.The delayed administration protocol of the mixture of neurotrophins allowed us to test the hypothesis that neurotrophins would have a reinnervation effect once the synaptic stripping had taken place. For doing so, abducens motoneurons were axotomized and 15 d later, once the stripping has taken place, treatment with neurotrophins started until the animals were killed after 30 d. The delayed administration protocol produced the largest recovery of bouton coverage (51.8 \u00b1 1.57%) around motoneuron somata with synaptophysin-IR profiles (Fig. 7, BDNF+NT-3; Fig. 8\n). Compatible with these results, the coverage with GFAP-IR profiles was the lowest of all treatments (15.9 \u00b1 0.9%). In the neuropil, the mix of BDNF and NT-3 in the delayed administration protocol produced also the largest recovery in the optical density (Fig. 8\n). These results indicate that neurotrophins used here have a profound synaptotrophic and synaptotropic effect on axotomized motoneurons.Present data show that BDNF and NT-3 administered to the severed axons of motoneurons results in both the prevention of stripping of synaptic afferents when immediately administered after lesion and the recovery of afferent innervation after synaptic stripping due to lesion. Axotomy also induced the decay in neuronal sensitivities to eye movements and a reduction in the amplitude of synaptic potentials of vestibular origin that were also restored to normal values when both neurotrophins were applied. Moreover, the discharge characteristics recovered in a complementary manner when only one neurotrophin was administered. Thus, it is shown the selective trophic dependence of bursting firing on NT-3 whereas BDNF supported the tonic firing of motoneurons. The present data support a link between the synaptotrophic actions of neurotrophins retrogradely delivered and the alterations of neuronal firing patterns during oculomotor behaviors through plastic rearrangements of synaptic contacts.Nerve injury induces profound changes at the structural and functional level of damaged motoneurons (Sumner, 1975; Mendell, 1984). It is well known that these changes in electrical and synaptic properties revert with target reinnervation (Delgado-Garc\u00eda et al., 1988; Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m and Kellerth, 1999) and remain altered when reinnervation is prevented (Sumner, 1976; Pinter and Vanden Noven, 1989; Vanden Noven and Pinter, 1989). Thus, for preventing random target reinnervation and/or reestablishment of trophic support from orbital tissues, we devised a method for controlling the extracellular environment that bathes the axonal stumps (Davis-L\u00f3pez de Carrizosa et al., 2008). We cannot ascertain whether neurotrophins signaled to afferents through transsynaptic translocation, like tetanus toxin does (Gonz\u00e1lez-Forero et al., 2005; Rind et al., 2005), or induced in the motoneurons the signal for alterations in their synaptic coverage.The cascade of events mediated by neurotrophins was initiated at Trk receptors located at the axonal stump and abolished by K252a, a selective inhibitor  and  of Trk action (Rutherford et al., 1997; Rattiner et al., 2004; Bozdagi et al., 2008). In our system, K252a led to decreased neuronal sensitivities to eye movement parameters that resembled those found during axotomy, and thus it can be concluded that this agent blocked the exogenous trophic support. It can be stressed the idea that exogenous trophic support switches the cellular program that maintains the axotomized cell synaptically disconnected from the afferent circuit to a cellular program which implies the reinnervation by afferents. Previous findings in the axotomized abducens motoneurons and internuclear neurons, also in the cat, support the idea of a strong dependence of these neurons on their target as demonstrated by the recovery of firing properties in coincidence with target reinnervation (Baker et al., 1981; Delgado-Garc\u00eda, 1988; Ben\u00edtez-Temi\u00f1o et al., 2005).Our findings show that neurotrophic support starting from the day of lesion prevents the withdrawal of synaptic inputs and that protection against synaptic stripping is more effective when BDNF and NT-3 were applied together rather than when only one neurotrophin alone was used. These results could indicate either an additive effect over all the different afferents to the motoneuron or a complementary effect over distinct afferents. Our neuronal recordings demonstrate the second alternative. Thus, NT-3 supported the phasic firing of motoneurons whereas BDNF supported the tonic firing. BDNF and NT-3 have a strong synaptotrophic action regulating the synaptic composition and the growth of presynaptic and postsynaptic elements in the adult brain (Novikov et al., 2000; Cotrufo et al., 2003) and  (McAllister et al., 1997; Je et al., 2006). It is noteworthy that BDNF and NT-3 frequently have opposing roles that account for the specification of electrophysiological properties in the spiral ganglion neurons (Adamson et al., 2002; Zhou et al., 2005) to the growth of dendrites in layer 4 pyramidal neurons (McAllister et al., 1997).NT-3 produced the recovery of the phasic firing during spontaneous saccades and increased the synaptic coverage of axotomized abducens motoneurons. The phasic component is provided by burst reticular neurons (excitatory and inhibitory; EBN, IBN) located in the paramedian pontine reticular formation (Highstein et al., 1976; Hikosaka et al., 1978; Igusa et al., 1980) that convey a strong burst during on-directed saccades and a pause during movements in the opposite direction (B\u00fcttner and B\u00fcttner-Ennever, 2006). It is likely that NT-3 exerts a trophic effect over reticular synaptic contacts on motoneurons that explains the robust bursts during saccades (Fig. 9). Similarly the presence of strong pauses associated to off-directed saccades indicates that also the inhibitory burst neurons are trophically maintained by NT-3, otherwise the rate-velocity plots found would have a smaller slope (Fig. 9). Interestingly, eye velocity sensitivity resulted after NT-3 treatment higher than in control motoneurons. A similar result occurs in the a synapses over axotomized spinal motoneurons  and . (Munson et al., 1997; Arvanian et al., 2003). NT-3 derived from muscle spindles or after NT-3 treatment increases the amplitude of this synapse over the control value, but results impaired for sustained high frequency firing (Mendell et al., 1999; Chen et al., 2002).Diagram indicating trophic actions of BDNF and NT-3 on abducens motoneurons afferents. Abducens motoneurons receive a main set of three bilateral and reciprocal afferents that convey signals for conjugate eye movements. Inputs represented to the right of the figure are ipsilateral. Trophic actions of BDNF and NT-3 are labeled in pink and green, respectively. See discussion for further details.BDNF induced the recovery of the tonic firing of axotomized abducens motoneurons as well as an increase in their synaptic coverage. The tonic component arises from the output of a velocity-to-position integrator (Aksay et al., 2001) whose main output cells are the burst-tonic neurons of the prepositus hypoglossi nucleus (Escudero et al., 1992) that provide a reciprocal tonic excitatory/inhibitory drive during on- and off-directed eye fixations, respectively (Fig. 9). Chronic treatment with BDNF has been shown to produce a long-term enhancement of synaptic transmission with no changes in voltage-gated sodium and potassium currents (Sherwood and Lo, 1999). Nonetheless, it has been shown that BDNF increases the excitability to depolarizing and hyperpolarizing currents through modulation of potassium currents rendering tonic and rebounding cells in response to current steps (Youssoufian and Walmsey, 2007). BDNF, also , decreases membrane potential fluctuations promoting rhythmical firing through a K252a-sensitive mechanism that increases a persistent sodium current (Fujisawa et al., 2004) that others have identified as a tetrodotoxin-insensitive sodium current (Blum et al., 2002). BDNF has also been shown to regulate the synaptic composition of axotomized motoneurons (Novikov et al., 2000). From the signal analysis of firing rate we found that both the -on and the -off sensitivities were both restored to control values after BDNF treatment alone or in combination with NT-3. This result indicates a trophic action of BDNF over the tonic excitatory and inhibitory input to the motoneurons. If that were not the case, the rate-position plots used to obtain the eye position sensitivity would have a smaller slope than that found (Fig. 9).A third major source of afferents to the abducens nucleus arises from the medial vestibular nucleus that provides reciprocal, excitatory-contralateral/inhibitory-ipsilateral input to the abducens motoneurons (Fig. 9). The firing of abducens neurons during the VOR can be expressed as the sum of a vestibular input and the output of a velocity-to-position integrator that provides abducens neurons a signal related to eye position. The vestibular signal is channeled through the position-vestibular-pause neurons (Ishizuka et al., 1980, McCrea et al., 1980) and the tonic signal is also mainly channelled through prepositus hypoglossi and these vestibular neurons (Ramachandran and Lisberger, 2006). We found excitatory vestibular synaptic potentials recovered with BDNF as well as the amplitude of modulation in the PSTH after contralateral vestibular stimulation, indicating that the input from excitatory vestibular neurons contralateral to the abducens would be dependent on the trophic action of BDNF. However, inhibitory vestibular synaptic potentials recovered with NT-3 treatment indicating that the ipsilateral vestibular neurons would be dependent on trophic support from NT-3 (Fig. 9).The present work opens the possibility for the existence of different motoneuronal types (tonic, phasic) according to their responsiveness to different mixtures of neurotrophins coming from the target. Our previous study (Ben\u00edtez-Temi\u00f1o et al., 2004) demonstrated the coexpression of TrkB and TrkC receptors in 72\u201382% of abducens motoneurons which also implies that 18\u201328% of the motoneurons might depend solely on either BDNF or NT-3. This would indicate that some control motoneurons might be purely tonic, others purely phasic and the vast majority tonic-phasic. This likely heterogeneity among motoneurons is in contrast, although, with the homogeneous firing patterns found in abducens motoneurons since every cell demonstrates a tonic and a phasic firing (Delgado-Garcia et al., 1986) (present data). Nonetheless, at least two types of motoneurons have been proposed recently on the basis of retrograde and transneuronal tracing (i.e., twitch large cells and small, nontwitch, peripherally located in the nucleus) (B\u00fcttner-Ennever et al. 2001; Ugolini et al., 2006). Despite the fact that smaller, nontwitch motoneurons, having thus higher input resistance, could have a similar sensitivity to saccades arising from a reduced number of reticular boutons, our data suggest that twitch and nontwitch motoneurons might express a different number of TrkB and TrkC receptors and/or receive different amounts of BDNF and NT-3 neurotrophins from their innervated muscle fibers, which in turn would modulate the synaptic coverage and firing patterns of abducens motoneurons.This work was supported by grants from Ministerio de Ciencia y Technologia-Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional [MCYT-FEDER (BFI2006-08414)], Fundaci\u00f3n de Investigaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica Mutua Madrile\u00f1a, Fundaci\u00f3n Eugenio Rodr\u00edguez Pascual and Junta de Andaluc\u00eda (P06-CTS-01420).

However, how the brain plans goal-oriented actions combining target reaching with equilibrium regulation is not yet clearly understood. An important question is whether postural control and reaching are integrated in one single module or controlled separately. Here, we show that postural control and reaching motor commands are processed by means of a modular and flexible organization. Principal component and correlation analyses between pairs of angles were used to extract global and local coupling during a whole-body pointing beyond arm's length. A low-dimensional organization of the redundant kinematic chain allowing simultaneous target reaching and regulation of the center of mass (CoM) displacement in extrinsic space emerged from the first analysis. In follow-up experiments, both the CoM and finger trajectories were constrained by asking participants to reach from a reduced base of support with or without knee flexion, or by moving the endpoint along a predefined trajectory (straight or semicircular trajectories). Whereas joint covaried during free conditions and under equilibrium restrictions, it was decomposed in two task-dependent and task-independent modules, corresponding to a dissociation of arm versus legs, trunk, and head coordination, respectively, under imposed finger path conditions. A numerical simulation supported the idea that both postural and focal subtasks are basically integrated into the same motor command and that the CNS is able to combine or to separate the movement into autonomous functional synergies according to the task requirements.Most of our daily life activities involve the entire body. However, the two traditional ways to investigate human motor control either focus on the equilibrium mechanisms (for review, see Horak and McPherson, 1996) without considering hand trajectory formation or, conversely, on reaching movements by artificially restricting the motion of the lower body parts (for review, see Shadmehr and Wise, 2005). Nevertheless, the picture of how the CNS plans goal-oriented action may probably be clarified by asking how all body parts are coordinated during a pointing task. For instance, when reaching beyond arm's length from a standing posture, the trunk-plus-arm action causes a displacement of the whole body with respect to the direction of gravity. Thus, in addition to arm trajectory formation and target reaching, the CNS must anticipate the potential loss of balance.An open question is whether these two subtasks are controlled as one single central command or separately (Hess, 1954; Belenkii et al., 1967; Cordo and Nashner, 1982; Schepens and Drew, 2003). A classical approach is to consider the two mechanisms in a hierarchical manner: equilibrium maintenance would be subordinated to reaching and lower limbs would offset the displacement of the center of mass (CoM) accompanying voluntary arm movement (Massion, 1992). According to this interpretation, lower and upper body parts would ensure equilibrium preservation and finger trajectory formation, respectively. Alternatively, a grouping of body angles was proposed as a kinematic solution to reduce the effective number of degrees of freedom and simplify the motor command (Bernstein, 1967; Alexandrov et al., 1998, 2001a,b; Lacquaniti et al., 1999; Thomas et al., 2005). In this case, equilibrium and reaching subtasks would be integrated in the same module, a term that we use to denote the covariation of a specific set of angles. To check whether the CNS would control one or several functional modules regrouping or dissociating focal and equilibrium task objectives, we tested the hypothesis that, according to the task demand, the CNS controls the whole body either as one single or two distinct modules. The finding of both global and local kinematic synergies would support a flexible modular organization (Bizzi et al., 2008) able to integrate or dissociate, if necessary, equilibrium maintenance and target reaching rather than a subordinate mode of control.Our approach consisted of applying equilibrium and spatial constraints on a natural unstable hand reaching and analyze the kinematics of the resulting movements to infer the mechanisms underlying the coordination of the two subtasks. In one condition, reaching was performed from a reduced base of support or without knee flexion to limit the capacity of producing horizontal or vertical CoM displacements. In another condition, subjects were asked to reach the target following a straight or semicircular finger trajectory. The priority given to one of the subtasks may clarify how the different body parts enter into coordination. Figure 1 sums up the possible motor strategies in response to these experimental restrictions. Reaching a target under postural or focal constraints could produce a global effect in which all body parts are integrated into one module, supporting the idea of a synergic control of postural and goal-oriented aspects of the action. Alternatively, the motor planning could be split in two distinct modules, one driving arm reaching and one maintaining equilibrium; the two modules could be new or be derived from the basic motor strategy initially present in the free condition. The results show that, when priority is given to hand trajectory, a second module originates from the basic kinematic strategy suggesting a flexible coordination of posture and movement.Schema illustrating the framework hypotheses. On the left, the rectangle represents the basic motor strategy (A) composed of a single module. Because of experimental task restrictions (spatial and equilibrium constraints) applied to A, two possible cases can be considered: a new motor strategy composed of one module, different from A or similar to A, can be elaborated by the CNS (B); alternatively, a new motor strategy (C) composed of two or more modules (Ci) can be elaborated. However, two possibilities can be considered in such a case: C can be composed of new modules, task dependent and different from any submodule (a submodule corresponds to the covariation of some body parts initially included in a module) of A, or some of these modules can be task independent and come from the initial motor strategy A.Twenty-six adults (all males, 18\u201329 years; mean height, 1.76 \u00b1 0.08 m; mean weight, 68 \u00b1 9 kg) agreed voluntarily to participate in the experiments. All were healthy with no previous neurological disease and normal or corrected-to-normal vision. The experiments conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki and informed consent was obtained from all the participants according to the protocol of the Ethics Committee of the Universit\u00e9 de Bourgogne. The experimental protocol is illustrated in Figure 2. The participants were divided in two groups: the first one performed the \u201cbasic\u201d and \u201cequilibrium\u201d experimental tasks (Fig. 2,,), whereas the second group performed the \u201cbasic\u201d and \u201cspatial\u201d experimental tasks (Fig. 2,,).Stick diagrams of the task performed under basic condition (), equilibrium constraints (, ), and spatial constraints (, ), for the near (D1) and the distant (D2) target. , Basic condition (BD1, BD2). , Knee-extended condition (KD1, KD2). , Reduce base of support condition (RD1, RD2). , Imposed straight finger trajectory condition (SD1, SD2). , Imposed semicircular trajectory condition (CD1, CD2). The dark gray and light gray traces depict the CoM and the finger trajectories in the sagittal plane, respectively. The inset box defines the eight elevation angles under consideration (Sk, shank; Th, thigh; Pe, pelvis; Tr, trunk; He, head; Hu, humerus; Fo, forearm; Ha, hand).All the participants performed the basic motor task (B condition) (Fig. 2) and the recorded results served as reference to compare the results of the other experimental tasks. A similar protocol was already used in recent studies (Pozzo et al., 2002; Schmid et al., 2006). Participants were asked to point with the two arms simultaneously toward a pair of targets placed at two different distances [lateral coordinates:  = \u00b10.2 m; vertical coordinates:  = 15% of each participant's height; anteroposterior (A-P) coordinates: , depending on the target distance]. The first target distance corresponded to 5% (short distance, D1), and the second to 30% (long distance, D2) of the participants' height. Both distances were measured from the distal end of the participants' great toe. Participants started from an upright standing position and their hands were located initially at the external side of the thighs and thus induced hand-pointing movements in a semipronated position. The whole movement was performed in the sagittal plane, with each side of the body moving together. Target accuracy was not the primary constraint imposed on the participants during the experiments, and no instruction was given to them regarding the movements to be effected by the body segments. Each participant achieved, at a natural (self-selected) speed, a block of 10 pointing movements for each condition of distance.Twelve participants took part in the experiment in which equilibrium constraints were added to the basic motor task (Fig. 2,). Equilibrium constraints were introduced in two different ways. Participants were asked to point toward the targets (1) by freezing their knee joints, a condition that imposed a high inverted pendulum configuration reducing stability (K condition, extended knee condition) (Fig. 2), and (2) from a reduced base of support (R condition) defined by a 40 cm large horizontal square (wooden board) fixed on a thin piece of wood (5 cm high, 5 cm large, and 40 cm long) (Fig. 2). In both conditions, they were asked to perform the motor task without falling from the small support or loosing equilibrium control. Participants stayed on the wooden board with the vertical projection of the malleolus of each foot at the backward limit of the thin piece of wood. Both motor tasks (K and R) were executed at a natural pace. Within each motor task, the number of trials and the order of execution of the two distances were similar to those of the basic motor task. One or two preliminary trials allowed participants to familiarize themselves with the experimental restrictions.Fourteen participants took part in the experiment (Fig. 2,) in which spatial constraints were added to the basic motor task. Participants were asked to point to the targets by using a straight finger trajectory (S condition) (Fig. 2). Participants initially performed three nonrecorded trials by following a straight wire connecting the initial finger position to the target. After this short period, they were asked to perform the task without wire and to keep the same speed as in previous experiments. Participants were also requested to reach the targets with large finger path curvatures (C condition; semicircular finger trajectory) (Fig. 2). The imposed path was concave in the sagittal plane (semicircle whose diameter was equal to the distance between the initial finger position and the target). Again, the participants performed three nonrecorded trials by tracking a curved wire connecting the initial finger position and the targets. Then, they were asked to perform the task without wire. Both tasks were performed at a natural pace. Within each motor task, the number of trials and the order of execution of the two distances were similar to those of the basic motor task. The participants were allowed to rest 1 min between each condition and the total duration of the whole experiment was 1.5 h.Movement kinematics was captured using an optoelectronic device (SMART-BTS). Nine cameras were used to measure the position of 11 retro-reflective markers (15 mm in diameter), which were placed at various anatomical locations on the right side of the body (external cantus of the eye, auditory meatus, acromial process, humeral lateral condyle, ulnar styloid process, apex of the index finger, D1 vertebra, greater trochanter, knee interstitial joint space, external malleolus, and fifth metatarsal head of the foot).All analyses were performed with custom software written in Matlab (Mathworks) from the recorded three-dimensional position of the 11 markers (sampling frequency, 120 Hz). Recorded signals were low-pass filtered using a digital fifth-order Butterworth filter at a cutoff frequency of 7.5 Hz (Matlab  function). The whole-body motion was performed in the sagittal plane. To verify the planarity hypothesis of the movement, we used a principal component analysis (PCA) (Jolliffe, 1986) on the whole three-dimensional dataset of each participant (grouping all markers as individual observations). The variance accounted for (VAF) by the two first principal components (PCs) was >98% for all participants, indicating that most markers trajectories were approximately lying on one plane. In particular, this plane was nearly the one defined by the reference frame of the acquisition system (, where  was the A-P axis and  was the vertical axis). The angle between normal vectors of the planes was <4 \u00b1 1.5\u00b0. Therefore, we projected the three-dimensional data on the plane  (, anteroposterior axis; , vertical axis) defined by our recording system.An estimation of CoM displacements was used to characterize the equilibrium performance. We estimated the position of the CoM using an eight-segment mathematical model consisting of the following rigid segments: head, trunk, thigh, shank, foot, upper arm, forearm, and hand. Using this model, the position of the CoM was calculated via standard procedures and using documented anthropometric parameters (Winter, 1990). The model used to determine the whole-body CoM position has previously been validated for similar whole-body reaching movements (Stapley et al., 1999). The final whole-body momentum (WBM) was also evaluated using an inverse pendulum model in which the whole-body mass was concentrated in its CoM. It was evaluated using the standard formula A-P, where  was the subject mass,  is the gravity acceleration (\u22489.81  \u00b7 \u22122), and A-P was the distance between the ankle (fixed point) and the projection of the CoM on the A-P axis.The finger kinematics was used to analyze the pointing performance. Finger movement onset time was defined as the instant at which the linear tangential velocity of the index fingertip exceeded 5% of its peak and the end of movement as the point at which the same velocity dropped below the 5% threshold. Standard kinematic parameters usually described in arm-pointing studies (Papaxanthis et al., 2005) were calculated as follows: movement duration (MD), peak velocity (PV), mean velocity (MV), relative time to peak velocity (TPV) defined as the ratio of the duration of acceleration and MD, index of finger path curvature (IPC = Dev/LD) defined as the ratio of the maximum path deviation (Dev) from a straight line connecting the initial and final finger positions [linear distance (LD)], and curvilinear distance of the finger (CD) defined by the integral over time from 0 to MD of the norm of the finger velocity vector (in plane ). To evaluate the consistency of the final finger position, we calculated the 95% confidence ellipses in plane . Constant errors were defined as the distance between the finger position and the target in three dimensions.Eight elevation angles (with respect to the vertical axis ; Sk, shank; Th, thigh; Pe, pelvis; Tr, trunk; He, head; Hu, humerus; Fo, forearm; Ha, hand) were defined (Fig. 2, inset). Arm angles will be referred to as \u201cupper limb\u201d angles in opposition to the angles of leg, trunk, and head, which will be referred to as \u201clower limb\u201d angles, for the sake of simplicity. The temporal window used for analyzing the angular displacement was based on the finger onset and ending times defined above. We visually verified that the finger marker was the first and the last to move compared with the other markers placed on the body. The angular time series are depicted in Figure 3. These time series were then used to compute (1) the amplitude of each angular displacement (defined as the absolute value of difference between the initial and final angle) and (2) an index of the whole-body coordination using PCA (see below).Angular kinematic values. , Basic (B), extended knee (K), and reduced base of support (R) conditions. From the left to the right, mean time series of the angular displacements, velocity profiles, and mean values of peak to peak angular displacements (histograms). , Same data for the basic (B), straight trajectory (S), and semicircular trajectory (C) conditions. The abbreviations are the same as in Figure 2.All time series were time-normalized to 200 points by using Matlab routines of interpolation (Matlab  function).PCA was applied to the angular displacements. Each sample of time was considered as a single observation lying in an ambient vector space whose dimension was given by the number of time series included in the analysis.For instance, consider a simple input dataset composed of eight columns (the angular displacements recorded during one trial) and 200 rows (normalized time). PCA could be thought as a generalization of a correlation analysis in a high dimensional space. In this case, PCA extracted the commonality between the angular displacements, which was sometimes referred to as \u201cwaveforms\u201d because it especially focused on the shape of the angular time series.Let \u0398 be the matrix of time-normalized angular displacements (200 rows \u00d7 8 columns). For each  \u03f5{1, \u2026, 8}, the th column of \u0398 (denoted by \u0398) was centered and normalized in amplitude using the formula \u0398\u0303 = (\u0398 \u2212 )/, where  and  were the mean and SD of \u0398, respectively, and thus, we got a new matrix \u0398\u0303. Then, the covariance matrix of \u0398\u0303 was computed (i.e., the correlation matrix of \u0398) and decomposed on the basis of eigenvectors (by orthonormal diagonalization). We preferentially used the correlation matrix to take into account the different ranges of motion of each segment. After reordering the eigenvalues by decreasing order (and thus rearranging the corresponding eigenvectors), the matrix of eigenvectors was denoted by  = ()1 \u2264 , \u2264 8. This matrix contained the weighting coefficients, i.e., the loadings of PCA. Then, the principal components (denoted by \u03a0, and referred to as PCs), which represented the most common waveforms contained in the input dataset, were defined as the following linear combination: \u03a0=\u0398\u0303W.For instance, the first PC (also referred to as PC1) was obtained by the following formula:\n\n [the first column of \u03a0 (i.e., a vector with 200 rows corresponding to the time)].When performing PCA, it was useful to examine the loadings to uncover how angular displacements were captured by each PC. To this aim, we thus analyzed each column of  (i.e., each eigenvector) that defined a one-dimensional vector subspace (i.e., a certain direction in the eight-dimensional vector space). These eigenvectors represented a well adapted basis of the eight-dimensional vector space, characterizing the most important directions (in the sense of the VAF), and, in this setting, a principal component was simply the projection of the data onto a subspace spanned by a certain eigenvector. The ratio between the first eigenvalue and the sum of all eigenvalues could be viewed as an index of the whole-body coordination (this value is commonly called the VAF by the PC1 and is referred to as PC1%). A PC1% value equal to 100% meant that the trajectory in the space of angles was a straight line (i.e., all angles were linearly correlated together). However, a low PC1% value indicated that only one principal component could not describe precisely the whole-body movement (i.e., the observations lay in a subspace whose dimension was >2, and thus, nonlinear relationships between angles existed). Therefore, we also reported the second PC whose VAF is denoted by PC2%. Large PC2% values expressed that at least one angular displacement differed from the most common waveform given by PC1.Here, instead of using 1560 independent PCAs (a PCA for each trial, each condition, and each participant), we used a PCA whose input dataset consisted of 800 or 960 columns (8 angles \u00d7 10 trials \u00d7 10 or 12 participants) and 200 rows (normalized time) for each experimental condition. The analysis was exactly the same as the one depicted above, except that the number of column of the input dataset changed. In this manner, the PCA automatically extracted the commonality between the shapes of the angular displacements [as in the study by Thomas et al. (2005)]. Nevertheless, individual PCA were also performed when necessary to seek intertrials adaptation, especially during the experiments with equilibrium or spatial constraints.A useful feature of PCA is the possibility to reconstruct an approximated whole-body movement from the data projected on the vector subspace spanned by the first eigenvector (or by more eigenvectors), using the inverse (or equivalently the transpose in our case) of the matrix  Here, the reconstructed centered and normalized angular displacements were simply obtained by the following formula: \u03f4\u0303Rec = \u03a0W\u22121. For instance, the reconstruction from PC1 only was obtained by using the first column of \u03a0 and the first row of \u22121 of the above formula. Then, the reconstructed angular displacements \u0398Rec were given, for each column , by the following equation: \u0398Rec =  \u0398\u0303Rec +. The same procedure was used to reconstruct movements from both PC1 and PC2 (by taking the appropriate rows and columns of \u03a0 and \u22121, respectively). Notice that the reconstructed angular displacements \u0398Rec were exactly equal to \u0398 when all PCs were used. Otherwise, we just got an approximation of the original angular displacements.Once the reconstructed angular waveforms were obtained, the position of markers in plane  were then recalculated. To reconstruct the markers kinematics, we assumed that the foot was fixed (which was approximately the case in practice). Head movement was reconstructed assuming that the trajectory of the auditory meatus marker was the one recorded in practice. Notice that this approximation had no influence on the finger trajectory and little influence on the CoM position.Finally, the same analyses were performed using the covariance matrix rather than the correlation matrix. In particular, this did not change the main results presented below. Here, we considered that the correlation matrix was better suited because angular displacements had significant different amplitudes.Covariation between angles was also estimated by means of a pairwise correlation analysis. Although loadings gave information concerning the joint coupling between pairs of angles (indeed, if loadings were the same for two angles, one could expect that these angles were highly correlated), a more direct method to analyze the coupling between pairs of angles was to compute the correlation coefficients between each pair of angles. In the two-dimensional case (i.e., if we observe only two angles), PC1% value was correlated to the coefficient of correlation. Thus, this analysis could be viewed as a local analysis compared with the global joint coupling given by the PC1% value. For a total of eight angles, 28 correlations were computed on all pairs of angles, which corresponded to the correlation matrix coefficients analysis, for each single movement. Statistically significant correlation coefficients ( < 0.05) were only retained by means of Matlab  function.To test the feasibility of a strategy combining an angular covariation with the production of a desired finger trajectory in the Cartesian space (S and C conditions), we conducted a numerical simulation. To this aim, we hypothesized that the movement was optimal according to the minimum angle jerk criterion in the space of elevation angles (Wada et al., 2001). Under this assumption, the angles covariation was perfect (i.e., the VAF by PC1 was exactly equal to 100%). This meant that all body angles were driven by one single principal component or, in other words, that one single module ensured both spatial and equilibrium subtasks. This was a plausible assumption according to previous results (Alexandrov et al., 1998; Thomas et al., 2005), which indicated that a single PC captured similar whole-body reaching tasks. In such a task, there was an infinity of final postures allowing to put the fingertip on the target and to preserve equilibrium because there were 8 degrees of freedom. In this simulation, the initial posture was fixed and we used a numerical optimization procedure aimed at finding the final posture such that the resulting finger trajectory fitted at best to the imposed finger path in task space (either a straight line or a circular arc, as in the S and C conditions). This was possible because, once a final posture was selected, the minimum angle jerk criterion allowed us to determine all limb displacements and, therefore, the finger path. The detailed procedure is given in Appendix.All variables were normally distributed (Shapiro\u2013Wilk's  test) and their variance was equivalent (Levene's test). Statistical effects were tested by performing ANOVAs (repeated measures) when appropriate [either a 5 (B, K, R, S, C) \u00d7 2 (D1, D2), a 3 (B, K, R) \u00d7 2 (D1, D2), or a 3 (B, S, C) \u00d7 2 (D1, D2) analysis].  analyses were conducted with Scheff\u00e9's test and Student's  tests were also used.Endpoint accuracy of the fingertip was first measured by means of 95% confidence ellipse analysis, in the sagittal plane. The area of the ellipses was equal to 6 \u00b1 2.5 cm2 on average, and their major and minor axes had similar lengths. The inspection of the areas of all individual ellipses across all experimental conditions did not reveal significant differences (area of ellipses; ANOVA,  = 0.82). Moreover, the mean endpoint error was 3 \u00b1 2 cm in three dimensions, and the LD between the initial finger position and the target were consistent among the different experimental conditions ( = 0.61) (Table 1).Mean values and SD of finger kinematics parameters for both short (D1) and long (D2) distances, and in all experimental conditions (basic, knee extended, reduced base of support, straight, and semicircular finger paths)We verified, for each participant and each angle, the consistency of angular displacements, in each experimental condition. The maximum intrasubject SD of amplitudes was <4\u00b0.We found similar movement durations for all the experimental conditions (ANOVA,  > 0.2 for all conditions), except for the semicircular finger path condition in which the movement duration was significantly longer (40%; ANOVA,  < 0.05) compared with the other experimental conditions (Table 1). This result is logical because the finger path imposed in this condition was obviously longer. However, the average velocities recorded in this condition were similar to those of all the other conditions ( = 0.23) (Table 1).All participants succeeded in performing the constrained motor tasks (extended-knee, K; reduced base of support, R; straight trajectory, S; and semicircular trajectory, C).Concerning the equilibrium constraints, as expected, the average knee joint amplitudes recorded in the extended knee condition (5 \u00b1 2\u00b0) were significantly lower ( tests,  < 0.001, for both distances) than those recorded during the basic motor task (B condition, 50 \u00b1 20\u00b0). Furthermore, the CoM position remained significantly higher (+0.1 m), compared with the basic motor task, when participants were requested to keep their knees extended, as a consequence of the lack of knee flexion. The extended knee condition was characterized by an important forward trunk bending (Fig. 3, green histograms for Pe and Tr). Moreover, all participants significantly decreased the A-P CoM displacements in the reduced base of support condition ( tests,  < 0.01, for both distances). The average decrease was 25% for the short distance and 50% for the long distance (Table 2, Fig. 4).CoM displacements along A-P and vertical axes and final WBMAverage CoM and finger trajectories and tangential velocity profiles, in the sagittal plane, for all experimental conditions: basic (B), extended knee (K), reduced base of support (R), straight finger trajectory (S), and semicircular finger trajectory (C). SDs are not depicted for the sake of clarity.Concerning the spatial constraints, the index of finger path curvature increased significantly ( tests,  < 0.001) by \u223c400% in the imposed semicircular trajectory condition compared with the basic one and remained concave in the sagittal plane (Table 1, Fig. 4). Analysis of index of finger path curvature in the imposed straight finger path condition confirmed that all participants produced approximately straight paths. Path curvature significantly decreased by 75% compared with those measured in the unconstrained condition ( tests,  < 0.001).Finally, no statistical difference between the two groups of participants that performed the basic motor task was found.Figure 2, , , and , qualitatively depicts the initial and final whole-body configurations, as well as the CoM and finger trajectories, in the basic (B) and equilibrium constraints conditions (K and R) for both target distances.Finger paths in the sagittal plane were strictly concave and approximately similar between the different experimental conditions (ANOVA, B \u00d7 K \u00d7 R \u00d7 2 distances;  = 0.52) (Table 1, Fig. 4), although a slight decrease of the index of path curvature was noticed in the reduced base of support condition. Tangential finger velocity profiles were bell-shaped in these conditions, as depicted in Figure 4. The velocity profiles recorded in the basic motor task were strongly asymmetric: the acceleration duration was shorter than the deceleration duration [average relative time to peak of velocity (i.e., TPV value) was equal to 0.45 \u00b1 0.05 in the basic condition] (Table 1). A significant difference was found between the basic and equilibrium conditions (ANOVA,  < 0.05), and a  analysis showed that TPV values significantly tended to 0.5 in the extended knee condition ( < 0.05), whereas they remained invariant in the reduced base of support condition ( = 0.57).Forward CoM displacements in the basic and extended knee conditions were \u223c40 and 70% of the foot length for the short and long distances, respectively. In contrast, as already noticed, the participants limited the forward A-P CoM displacement [<4 cm (i.e., <30% of the foot length)] in the reduced base of support condition (R), because of the experimental restriction; significant statistical differences ( < 0.01) were obtained when comparing the reduced base of support condition with the basic and extended knee conditions. Despite these modifications in amplitude, CoM path was task independent and kept the same characteristic two components: an initial curvilinear and goal-oriented forward displacement followed by a straight downward movement (Stapley et al., 1999; Pozzo et al., 2002). Downward displacements of CoM were larger in the basic and reduced base of support conditions compared with the knee extended condition ( < 0.01) (Table 2). Notice that forward and downward displacements of the CoM significantly increased for the long distance ( < 0.01) as a consequence of a greater contribution of shank, pelvis, and humerus segments, necessary to reach the target (Fig. 3, histograms). The velocity profiles of the CoM were single-peaked in all conditions (Fig. 4) and exhibited the same trend as finger TPV values.Interestingly, participants were able to keep their equilibrium in both conditions. The changes in angular displacements were not detrimental to the covariation of elevation angles. Indeed, PCA showed that the VAF by PC1 was constantly >85% for all the conditions ( = 0.45) (Fig. 5, black histograms), which is comparable with the values calculated in previous similar motor tasks (Alexandrov et al., 1998; Thomas et al., 2005). The PC1% value increased significantly (+3%) at the long distance compared with the short distance ( < 0.01). Moreover, the principal component waveforms did not change significantly as reflected by the large correlation coefficients computed when comparing PC1 and PC2 between conditions (Fig. 5). The PC1 captured the monotonic angular displacements with bell-shaped velocity profiles, whereas the second PC captured nonmonotonic angular displacements with double-peaked speed profiles (Fig. 3,, middle column). In addition, an inspection of the loadings did not reveal significant changes in the reduced base of support condition for both distances (average 2 = 0.97). At variance, in the extended knee condition, the angles were differently distributed among PC1 and PC2, and showed changes mainly in the leg angles (e.g., shank and thigh), because of the joint restriction imposed at the knee (Fig. 5). However, the PC1% value remained high despite these changes., PC1% and PC2% values.

Correlation coefficients (2) are reported between the loadings of the basic condition and the loadings of a constrained condition.Figure 2,  and , qualitatively illustrates the initial and final whole-body configurations, as well as the CoM and finger trajectories, under spatial constraints (S and C) for both target distances.As already noticed, participants performed approximately straight and semicircular finger paths in these conditions. The velocity time courses tended to become more symmetric in the imposed straight finger trajectory condition (TPV value was on average 0.49 \u00b1 0.04;  = 0.06), being close to what would be predicted by a minimum Cartesian jerk model (straight trajectory and symmetric speed profile) (Flash and Hogan, 1985). In contrast, the velocity profiles recorded in the semicircular condition were double-peaked (Table 1, Fig. 4) similar to those obtained during via point movement (Viviani and Flash, 1995).The analysis of CoM displacements revealed significant changes across the experimental conditions (Table 2, Fig. 4). Specifically, in the imposed finger trajectory conditions, A-P and vertical CoM displacements increased (+22%;  < 0.05) and decreased (\u221212%;  < 0.01), respectively, compared with the basic condition. These changes led the participants to adopt a more risky inverted pendulum configuration because of (1) the A-P CoM displacement close to the forward limit of the BoS and (2) a longer level arm inducing a larger potential energy and a greater whole-body momentum (approximately +22%) (Table 2) compared with the basic experiment. In contrast to finger trajectory, the CoM velocity remained single-peaked in C condition.Remarkably, the covariation of elevation angles was strongly affected by spatial constraints onto the finger path. The statistical analysis revealed a significant decrease of the PC1% value in these conditions (\u22128 and \u221213%, respectively;  < 0.01) compared with the basic condition. This was compensated by a drastic increase of the PC2% value that was about twice larger than the values computed in the basic condition (Fig. 5, gray histograms). Similarly to the basic motor task, the covariation of elevation angles was greater (+6%) for the long distance compared with the short distance ( < 0.05) in the motor tasks with spatial constraints. The inspection of principal components revealed that their waveforms were unchanged compared with the basic condition (Fig. 5, large correlation coefficients). Nevertheless, the loadings analysis revealed changes in their distribution among the PC1 and especially the PC2. A noticeable effect was an increase (in absolute value) of the loadings for the arm angles (humerus, forearm, and hand): the upper limb angles were more strongly captured by the PC2 in the imposed finger trajectory conditions compared with the basic one. This result was quite striking because these changes were accompanied by a significant decrease and increase of the PC1% and PC2% values, respectively. Thus, spatial but not equilibrium constraints modified significantly the relative importance of PC1 and PC2.In particular, an interesting result was the decrease of the PC1% and the increase of PC2% values (14 of 14 participants for the short distance; 12 of 14 participants for the long distance) consecutively to the straight finger path constraint. To evaluate a possible effect of a learning process on this change in the covariation of elevation angles, we asked 4 among the 14 participants to perform 50 successive trials in the straight Cartesian trajectory condition for the long distance. To avoid the potential influence of fatigue, participants took a rest of 1 min after each block of 10 trials (Schmid et al., 2006). Figure 6 shows average results for the PC1% value. A linear regression analysis on the average PC1% values among the 50 repetitions showed slope and 2 coefficients <10\u22123 indicating a lack of adaptation among the 50 trials in the imposed straight finger trajectory condition, for the long distance (SD2). Furthermore, a between-participants  test comparison among the PC1% average values of the 10 first and 10 last trials did not give significant differences ( = 0.29).Typical PC1% values of one typical subject for 50 successive trials. The continuous black line corresponds to the PC1% baseline measured during the basic condition. The dashed line indicates the linear regression calculated on the 50 records performed in the straight finger trajectory condition at long distance (SD2).To better elucidate the respective roles of the PC1 and PC2 on the movement, we reconstructed the angular displacements and then the kinematic features of the body markers, from either the first or both the first and the second principal components (see Materials and Methods).First, the whole movement was reconstructed based on the data contained in the first principal component. Figure 7 shows that the reconstructed movement was very similar to the one recorded in the basic condition (B), for a typical participant. The characteristic features of the basic motor task were captured well by the PC1 (e.g., the forward CoM projection and the concave finger trajectory) (Table 3) (Pozzo et al., 2002). In particular, the CoM and finger trajectories were close to the recorded ones (Fig. 7), the angular displacements were also similar as indicated by the large correlation coefficients (Fig. 7), and the velocity profiles of both the finger and the CoM were single-peaked (Fig. 7). Second, when the motion was reconstructed using the data contained in the PC1 and PC2, the whole-body movements became extremely close to the recorded ones, whatever the experimental conditions (as proved by the high correlation coefficients reported in Fig. 7,)., From left to right, stick diagrams depicting the finger and CoM trajectories of a recorded and typical movement, the corresponding reconstruction from PC1, and from both PC1 and PC2 for the following conditions: basic task (B), imposed straight finger trajectory condition (S), and semicircular finger path condition (C). , Recorded and reconstructed angular displacements from PC1, and both PC1 and PC2, across the spatial constraints condition. For the reconstruction from PC1 and PC2, the displacements are almost superimposed and not always visible. Correlation coefficients (2) are reported: the first and second values are the results of comparisons between the basic angular displacement and the reconstructed angular displacement from PC1 and from both PC1 and PC2, respectively. , Comparison between recorded velocity profiles and reconstructed velocity profiles from either PC1 or both PC1 and PC2. Correlation coefficients are reported, measuring the similarity between these velocity profiles. The first and second values correspond to a comparison with the reconstructed movement from PC1 and from both PC1 and PC2, respectively.Reconstructed kinematic measures from all PCs, from PC1 only, and from both PC1 and PC2However, the main result lies in the differences observed when reconstructing motions from PC1 in the motor tasks with spatial constraints imposed on finger trajectory. Movements reconstructed in these conditions showed that the requested Cartesian constraints were not captured by the PC1 (i.e., the straight and semicircular finger paths constraints were not encoded in the PC1) (Fig. 7, second and third columns). Table 3 shows, on specific parameters, that the A-P CoM displacement was well reconstructed by the use of PC1 in all experimental conditions, in contrast to the finger trajectory. Indeed, the index of finger path curvature did not fit well with those recorded experimentally (or, equivalently, obtained when reconstructing the motion from all PCs). Whatever the condition, the reconstructed finger path was constantly slightly concave and, in particular, did not fit with the spatial constraints. The addition of PC2 in the reconstruction process was necessary to recover the spatial requirements imposed to the motor task (Table 3). Therefore, the PC2 appeared to be strongly implied in a fine control of the fingertip path, whereas the PC1 encoded the main characteristics of the whole-body motion performed in the basic condition, including the forward CoM displacement and the slightly concave finger path. Correlation analyses between the recorded and reconstructed angular displacements were also performed to quantify in which proportion each angular displacement was reconstructed. Lower correlation coefficients were measured between angular displacements for the angles of upper limbs, especially in the semicircular condition. This result suggests that PC1 primarily described the equilibrium and free reaching subtasks, whereas PC2 (for which PC2% values increased significantly in the spatial constraints conditions) adjusted the finger trajectory to the task requirement (S and C conditions). Such a reorganization was mainly achieved by means of the hand, forearm, and humerus angular displacements. These findings were consistent for both distances and across participants, even for those who maintained a relatively high joint coupling during the straight finger trajectory condition.To uncover specific angles covariations at different levels of the whole body, we performed a correlation analysis between each pair of angles (see Materials and Methods) (Fig. 8). Because eight angles were measured, a total of 28 correlation coefficients were analyzed. In most cases, the results showed that all correlation coefficients were >0.7 in the basic and equilibrium constraint motor tasks (see top left polar graph), as expected from the results given by PCA in these conditions (Fig. 5). An ANOVA performed on the 28 coefficients (28 factors), for each condition separately, showed a significant main effect ( < 0.001) (i.e., at least two correlation coefficients were significantly different among the 28 comparisons). Despite the fact that all correlation coefficients were >0.7, it was noticeable that, when calculating correlations between angles of the upper limbs (U) with angles of the lower limbs (L), the correlation coefficients were slightly lower (Fig. 8, mixed pairs of angles, L/U, M1 to M15) than the coefficients corresponding to L1 to L10 (L/L, pairs of angles within the lower limbs group). Nevertheless, a  analysis did not reveal important differences (in general,  > 0.05) for the basic and equilibrium constraints conditions., Polar diagrams of average correlation coefficients computed for the 28 pairs of elevation angles. The center and the external border of each polar diagram correspond to a minimal (=0.1) and maximal correlation (=1), respectively. SDs are not displayed on the figure for the sake of clarity.

The legend on the right indicates the angles defining each pair considered. , Average correlation coefficients computed between the time series of angular displacement recorded during the basic condition (B) and the other conditions (K, R, S, and C), for each angle, at D1 (left) and D2 (right). Error bars represent the SE between participants. The abbreviations are the same as in Figure 2.At variance, in the spatial constraints conditions (Fig. 8, top right polar graph), the correlation coefficients significantly decreased for the mixed pairs of angles (L/U, M1 to M15, <0.7).  analysis proved that all coefficients of this group (L/U, M1 to M15) were significantly different from both the upper limbs (U/U, U1 to U3) and the lower limbs (L/L, L1 to L10) comparisons ( < 0.05 at D1), illustrating a change in the whole-body motor strategy (a significant separation between upper and lower limbs). For the long distance (Fig. 8, bottom right part), correlation coefficient values increased compared with the short distance condition ( < 0.01), indicating a stronger coupling of upper and lower limbs when the task required a fine equilibrium control (long distance, D2). It should be noted that the decrease of the covariation of elevation angles, observed in the straight (S) and semicircular (C), was less pronounced at D2 compared with the short distance (D1), remaining, however, below the values obtained in the basic and equilibrium constraints motor tasks (Fig. 8, left).To verify the idea of a dissociation of reaching limbs (arm segments) from a robust equilibrium module during spatial constraint, we computed the average correlation coefficients between the waveforms measured in the basic motor task (B) and the other experimental conditions, for each of the eight angles (Fig. 8). In this way, we quantified the changes in the angular displacements induced by the experimental conditions with respect to the basic condition. A repeated-measure ANOVA showed that these changes were significantly concentrated in the hand, forearm, and humerus angles compared with the leg, trunk, and head angles ( < 0.001 and values of 2 = 0.92 and 0.72 for lower limbs and upper limbs, respectively). Thus, in addition to the drastic reorganization of upper limbs in response to the spatial constraints, the lower limbs displacements remained invariant (i.e., highly correlated to the ones observed in the basic condition).Overall, these analyses revealed one PC that captured lower limbs and CoM displacements and resisted to spatial constraints exerted on the finger, and another one, task-dependent, that emerged when focal subtask became a priority.The previous results showed that, in the basic condition, equilibrium and focal subtasks were integrated in the same module from which emerged an additional module when specific finger path had to be planned. Because priority was given to finger trajectory without requirement concerning the joint strategy to be used (i.e., one could have asked the participants to produce a straight finger path and to move all body segments at the same time), the dissociation of equilibrium and focal task goals in two modules could be inherent to the spatial constraints. Thus, to test the plausibility of one single module to generate simultaneously a straight path in angle space and a specific finger trajectory in Cartesian space, we performed a simulation (for details, see Materials and Methods and Appendix).Therefore, we simulated the integration of both the equilibrium and reaching task objectives in one single module during whole-body pointing (WBP) under spatial restriction. The result of this simulation showed that the production of a perfectly straight trajectory in the elevation angles space, combined with an almost straight or semicircular finger path in Cartesian space is (1) possible with respect to the physiological ranges of joint angular displacement but (2) detrimental to equilibrium control. In particular, the spatial constraints led to a CoM displacement close to the boundaries of the base of support (90 and 100% of the base of support, respectively) (Fig. 9). Indeed, the backward CoM displacement toward the heels recorded in the straight finger path simulation (Fig. 9) reduced the balance safety margin. Furthermore, a second forward CoM acceleration toward the target to reach requires a large energy consumption. At last, back-and-forth CoM displacements drastically differed from the robust monotonic CoM forward displacements presently recorded in all experimental conditions.Recorded data. , Typical stick diagram of a whole-body pointing task performed in the basic condition, at long distance (BD2).

The abbreviations are the same as in Figure 2.Our results show that reaching and equilibrium subtasks are integrated in one single coordinative structure (i.e., one single module) when subjects reached beyond arm's length without any particular spatial or equilibrium constraint. In contrast, when the CNS has to explicitly plan the finger path, the basic kinematic strategy was separated in two modules enabling fast adaptation to equilibrium and focal task demands. Here, we discuss the possible origins of arm and lower limbs covariation, and thus we emphasize the decomposition of the single kinematic module in equilibrium and reaching modules.Several factors can contribute to build a strong joint covariation. During the present task, the whole body moves downward mainly under the action of gravity. An anticipative inhibition of the tonic activity of the trunk and lower limbs extensors has been described during a similar downward whole-body motion (Cheron et al., 1997), as a general deactivation of extensor muscles [the so-called Hufschmidt phenomenon (Hufschmidt and Hufschmidt, 1954)]. Passive mechanical effects might additionally help in joint coupling. Indeed, previous studies showed that the mechanical consequences of forward arm reaching from an upright stance position consisted of passive forward trunk bending and knee flexion (Ramos and Stark, 1990; Eng et al., 1992; Pozzo et al., 2001), similar to these observed during the present WBP task. Coordinative structures of redundant degrees of freedom can also be accounted for by attractor dynamics, operating on an internal model of the underlying kinematic system (Mussa Ivaldi et al., 1988; Mohan and Morasso, 2006). At last, neural organization as well could determine the present angular covariation. Ivanenko et al. (2005), for instance, identified only one synergy from the recorded activity of 32 muscles during a stoop in place task. Moreover, it has been shown that trunk bending (as an important aspect of the present task) was under the control of \u201caxial synergies\u201d (i.e., a coordinated and opposing displacements of trunk and lower body segments) (Babinski, 1899; Alexandrov et al., 1998, 2001b). The present joint coupling is compatible with the functional mechanism previously proposed by which descending neural command related to the desired CoM trajectories and final finger position are transformed into a specific joint angle covariation (Ivanenko et al., 2005; d'Avella et al., 2006; Ting, 2007). For instance, when knee extension was imposed (K condition), the pointing was mainly attributable to forward trunk bending to compensate for the lack of knee flexion. This new joint configuration induced a higher level of the position of the CoM as a consequence of the lack of knee flexion, and represented an additional source of postural instability. Surprisingly, these changes did not affect joint coupling compared with the basic condition (B), revealing a significant flexibility of the motor command to keep joint covariation and consecutive similar finger and CoM trajectories in the sagittal plane. Furthermore, when placed on a thin support (R condition), subjects still exhibited strong covariation of elevation angles. Thus, the well preserved joint covariation, the associated stereotypical CoM, and finger trajectories are compatible with a process that would map low-dimensional task variables (the final finger position and the CoM trajectory) onto high-dimensional anatomical details (individual limbs) (Ting, 2007). In the same vein, covariation of limb rotation in extrinsic space points to a simple organization previously identified for the lower limbs (Lacquaniti et al., 1999) or the head segment (Pozzo et al., 1990) during locomotion that both reduces the high dimensionality of the kinematic chain and allows the control of the CoM displacement with respect to gravity. This strategy likely facilitates the integration of reaching and equilibrium subtasks in the same motor plan. Furthermore, because of the mechanical link existing between upper and lower body parts, separate controllers seem not functionally appropriate to predict and compensate the interaction torques inherent to multijoint movements. Pigeon et al. (2003) also demonstrated that, during turn and reach movement involving the trunk, the different body parts are integrated in a single frame of reference to predict appropriate joint torque and prevent disturbing effect on hand path. Finally, the strong temporal coupling between times to peak velocity of the finger and the whole-body center of mass, regardless of drastic change in sensory and mechanical context (earth versus microgravity) previously described for the same task (Patron et al., 2005) (Fig. 7; Tables 1, 2), support the idea that the two task objectives may to some degree share common neural commands.An important result is that, when subjects were forced to move the finger along a straight (S condition) or a semicircular (C condition) path, a second coordinative structure dedicated to arm segment coordination emerged from the initial kinematic strategy. For the exaggerated C condition, one could have expected such a dissociation because of the large discrepancy between natural and imposed finger trajectories. In contrast, it was more unlikely for the S condition that imposed a straight line close to the basic slightly curved finger path. This result demonstrates that the curved finger path recorded in the free condition was not the result of an error in trajectory planning. Thus, if desired, participants could execute the WBP task by adopting another reaching movement, a straight hand path for instance that is not the one chosen in the free condition.In S and C conditions, priority was given to the control of hand movement, as during object manipulation or object avoidance while reaching performed from a standing posture. Thus, inefficiency in controlling the finger path and the current highly redundant body joint system at the same time rather than a voluntary strategy adopted by the participants, could explain arm and lower limbs decoupling. Several arguments contradict with such a hypothesis. First, the unstable high inverted pendulum posture adopted by the participants when spatial restrictions were present required an efficient equilibrium control. Thus, a precise prediction of the mechanical effect of the CoM acceleration must be incorporated in the inverse model of the motor plan to produce a continuous smooth and linear finger path. Because participants succeeded after only two or three trials, without increasing movement duration compared with the free condition or any adaptation after several repetitions (Fig. 6), we conclude that kinematic decoupling was actively performed. Second, simulation procedures have clearly shown that the two subtasks could be integrated in the same motor plan with only few changes in experimentally recorded body geometry, supporting the biomechanical feasibility of keeping both joint covariation and straight finger path. However, CoM analysis revealed that such a strategy was detrimental to equilibrium control, a likely reason for the CNS not to adopt this way. Additionally, this postural solution contrasts with the stereotyped trajectory recorded whatever the condition (Fig. 4) and characterized by an initial forward CoM acceleration. The robustness of this pattern, existing among a wide range of voluntary movements (Crenna and Frigo, 1991; Stapley et al., 1998), could represent a neural constraint contributing to preserve the equilibrium module invariant when reaching under finger path restriction. Consequently, rather than revealing inefficient coordination of the multijoint system because of the experimental condition, we propose that the dissociation of the basic coordinative structure in two modules would correspond to an intended strategy.Finally, the spatial constraints did not destroy the local coupling of lower segments indicating that postural module was task independent. Instead, a new module used to produce an optional finger trajectory (S or C) was added up to the module found in the basic whole-body reaching condition as predicted in the top right part of Figure 1.The present addition of a new kinematic module to an existing one is consistent with the proposal that compound movements are generated by means of a combination of motor programs (Bizzi et al., 2008). Similarly, other studies have demonstrated modularity of muscle use in cat (Ting and Macpherson, 2005; Krouchev et al., 2006), in frogs (Hart and Giszter, 2004; d'Avella and Bizzi, 2005), and in humans (Ivanenko et al., 2005; d'Avella et al., 2006). Basic synergies built during development are probably slowly adjusted and differ slightly their expression to tolerate a wide range of tasks inducing various CoM and endpoint trajectories. However, in an unusual condition, it seems that they can adapt very rapidly or can be completed with additional ones to provide more behavioral flexibility. At which stage of the CNS the motor synergies are adapted to environmental demands or combined remains an open question. Even far from the scope of this study, we would like to discuss briefly some points according to the literature. Capaday (2004) has emphasized the functional linking of motor cortical points based on disinhibition process. Thus, synergies could emerge from the recruitment of various motor cortical points by selected excitation as well as by selected release from inhibition. At the level of the spinal cord, central descending pathways could influence and modulate reflex pathways depending on the context within which we must act (for review, see Dietz, 1992). Various descending pathways can then modulate the spinal cord for greater flexibility of basic reflexes. For instance, recent data recorded in cat showed that neurons in pontomedullary reticular formation can both ensure integrated or independent control of posture and reaching (Schepens and Drew, 2004; Schepens et al., 2008). Together, one can speculate that the basic coordinative structure could first emerge at the level of M1 depending on task demands. To provide flexibility, the motor commands could be adapted at the level of spinal cord via excitation or inhibition processes channeling appropriate contexts to the kinematic strategy and thus constructing the reaching and equilibrium subtasks by using one or two modules. Nevertheless, without a detailed analysis of patterns of focal and postural muscle activity, definite conclusions relating to the organization of descending neural commands are difficult to make. An upcoming study of muscle activation patterns should reveal how many muscle synergies are required for task performance and their robustness to different contexts.This appendix gives details concerning the kinematic simulation that we briefly described in Materials and Methods.Let us consider a rigid nine-segment model of the body and define eight elevation angles (Fig. 2, inset) as follows: (\u03b8Sk,\u03b8Th,\u03b8Pe,\u03b8Tr,\u03b8He,\u03b8Hu,\u03b8Fo,\u03b8Ha) = \u0398. The foot angle was neglected because ankle marker coordinates remained constant.First, we assumed that the trajectory in angle space resulted from the minimum angle jerk criterion, which minimized the following integral cost (Wada et al., 2001):\n\n where \u0398 was the th component of \u0398, and  denoted the time.In the following, the movement duration was normalized (MD = 1). It is well known that the optimal solutions are straight lines in the eight-dimensional vector space connecting the initial configuration of segments (\u0398) to the final one (\u0398) with the following formula:\n\n Notice that, therefore, the PC1% value was equal to 100%.Then, the finger trajectory was given by an equation of the form (, ) = 0. Because the initial position (0, 0) and the final position (, ) of the finger were known, we defined the following two functions:For the straight finger path case, we set\n\n. For the semicircular finger path case, we set\n\n and kept only the part of the curve in the semiplane defined by (, ) \u2265 0. The latter equation described an arc of a circle. The point () was the middle of the segment of length LD that was defined in Materials and Methods.The relationship between the elevation angles and the finger position was given by the following:\n\n The  parameter corresponded to the segment length of each segment, and (Ak, Ak) corresponded to the ankle marker position. Notice that Equation 2 did not depend on the head angle.The optimal problem was to find a final configuration \u03f4 minimizing the error between the imposed finger path [given by equations () = 0] and the path resulting from the choice of \u0398, given by Equation 2. Notice that the initial limb configuration was already known and fixed in this procedure.For the imposed straight finger path, the cost under minimization was defined as the straightness of the finger trajectory, which was measured with the correlation coefficient of the finger coordinates (, ).For the imposed semicircular finger path, the cost was defined as the IPC parameter that had to tend to 0.5 if the finger trajectory was a circular arc.For both conditions, we also tested to directly minimize the root mean squared error between the simulated and the imposed finger path, and this did not change significantly the kinematic strategy found by the optimal process.To conserve a degree of biological validity, the following nonlinear constraints were added to the optimal problem: (1) The A-P position of the CoM was forced to remain in a position within the points of support bounded by the heels and toes. This length was evaluated as the distance between the foot markers plus 6 cm in both forward and backward directions. (2) The final body configuration was requested to be compatible with the reach of the target (using the finger marker position) and such that biological articular limits were respected (using the biological ranges of joint angles).This problem was solved numerically by using the optimization Matlab toolbox. A SQP (sequential quadratic programming) method was used ( Matlab function). The minimization of the above costs was subject to nonlinear inequalities (position of the CoM and articular limits) and equalities (position of the finger on the target) defined in a user-supplied function.Basically, the procedure was initialized to the final limb configuration recorded during the basic motor task (Fig. 9). We also initialized the process with 10 other admissible final limbs configurations selected randomly to limit the problem of local minima, and the resulting kinematic solutions were strongly similar whatever the chosen initial limb configuration. The solutions that we got are depicted in Figure 9.This work was supported by Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales and by Conseil R\u00e9gional de Bourgogne. We thank C. Darlot, P. Morasso, and P. J.

Catecholamine/NPY cell bodies are concentrated in the A1 and caudal C1 cell cluster (A1/C1) in the ventrolateral medulla, a region highly sensitive to glucoprivic challenge. To further investigate the importance of this catecholamine subpopulation in glucoregulation, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology to produce a targeted gene knockdown of NPY and dopamine-\u03b2-hydroxylase (DBH), a catecholamine biosynthetic enzyme. Unilateral injection of NPY siRNA and DBH siRNA (0.02 nmol each) both significantly inhibited expression of the targeted genes up to 2 d, as revealed by real-time PCR, and reduced protein expression up to 8 d, as revealed by immunohistochemistry, compared with the control nontargeting siRNA (ntRNA) side. Subsequently, targeted siRNA or control ntRNA was injected bilaterally into A1/C1 and responses to 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG; 200 mg/kg)-induced glucoprivation were tested 3\u20137 d later. Silencing of either  or  alone did not reduce glucoprivic feeding or hyperglycemic responses, compared with responses of ntRNA-injected controls. In contrast, simultaneous silencing of both  and  reduced 2DG-induced feeding by 61%. Neither the hyperglycemic response to 2DG nor feeding elicited by mercaptoacetate (68 mg/kg)-induced blockade of fatty acid oxidation (\u201clipoprivic feeding\u201d) was reduced by simultaneous silencing of these two genes. These results suggest that catecholamines and NPY act conjointly to control glucoprivic feeding and that the crucial NPY/catecholamine coexpressing neurons are concentrated in the A1/C1 cell group.Glucose is an obligate metabolic fuel for the brain, necessary for both normal function and survival. Protection of the brain's glucose supply depends on a number of glucoregulatory responses, elicited by glucose deficit, that function to conserve and redistribute remaining glucose stores and restore circulating glucose levels. Studies using the selective catecholamine immunotoxin, anti-dopamine-\u03b2-hydroxylase (DBH)-saporin, have demonstrated that key glucoregulatory responses, including feeding (Ritter et al., 2001), adrenal medullary secretion (Ritter et al., 2001; Madden et al., 2006), corticosterone secretion (Ritter et al., 2003) and suppression of estrous cycles (I'Anson et al., 2003), require hindbrain epinephrine (Epi) and/or norepinephrine (NE) neurons.In addition to glucoregulatory responses, other critical homeostatic functions are also controlled by hindbrain catecholamine neurons (Gieroba et al., 1994; Stornetta et al., 1999; Madden and Sved, 2003; Rinaman, 2003; Date et al., 2006; Dinh et al., 2006; Pertovaara, 2006). The functional heterogeneity of these neurons and the anatomical complexity of the hindbrain have made it difficult to identify the specific catecholamine neurons associated with particular functions. Here we use RNA-mediated interference to localize and establish the phenotype of catecholamine neurons involved in glucoprivic feeding. RNA-mediated interference is a sequence-specific RNA silencing mechanism (Sioud, 2004; Dillon et al., 2005) triggered in mammalian cells by the presence of double-stranded RNA or small interfering RNA (siRNA) (Fire et al., 1998; Elbashir et al., 2001). Binding of active siRNA to the target mRNA leads to cleavage and degradation of the target mRNA, resulting in a reversible silencing of gene expression (\u201cgene silencing\u201d). siRNAs are potentially powerful tools for defining the specific functions of particular neuronal phenotypes, even when these phenotypes are intermingled with cells of other phenotypes and functions.Here we apply gene silencing to NE and Epi neurons in the area of overlap of cell groups A1 and C1 (A1/C1) to determine their importance for glucoprivic feeding. Previous work strongly suggests that this group is important for the feeding response. Nearly all A1/C1 neurons coexpress neuropeptide Y (NPY) (Everitt et al., 1984; Sawchenko et al., 1985) and either NE or Epi, all of which are orexigenic when administered centrally (Ritter et al., 1975; Stanley and Leibowitz, 1984, 1985; Leibowitz et al., 1988; Taylor et al., 2007). The A1/C1 neurons are potently activated by glucoprivation (Ritter et al., 1998; Li and Ritter, 2004; Li et al., 2006), they innervate hypothalamic areas known to be critical for metabolic and appetite controls (Sawchenko et al., 1985), and are destroyed by injections of anti-DBH-saporin that abolish glucoprivic feeding (Ritter et al., 2001). Nevertheless, some catecholamine neurons located in other cell groups share some of these properties. Therefore, to determine the importance of cells in A1/C1, we focused our gene silencing on this site, targeting the genes for  and . We hypothesized that if A1/C1 neurons mediate glucoprivic feeding, localized silencing of  and/or  expression in this site would impair this response. We also examined effects of this treatment on lipoprivic feeding, a response that does not require these catecholamine neurons (Ritter et al., 2001).Male Sprague Dawley rats were purchased from Simonsen Laboratories and housed individually in an animal care facility approved by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. Rats were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle with  access to pelleted rodent food (F6 Rodent diet; Harlan Teklad) and tap water. All experimental procedures were approved by Washington State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, which conforms to National Institutes of Health Guidelines.Catecholamine cell groups are defined as in Paxinos and Watson (1997). However, we have adopted additional terms to subdivide cell group C1 along its rostral-caudal extent. The caudal portion of C1 overlaps cell group A1 and, as in the atlas, is designated as A1/C1. We refer here to the middle portion of C1 as C1m, which extends from 12.72\u201312.30 mm caudal to bregma. The rostral portion (C1r) extends rostrally another 0.5 mm to the caudal border of the facial nucleus (12.30\u201311.70 mm caudal to bregma).For siRNA injections, rats were anesthetized using 1.0 ml/kg body weight of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine mixture [5 ml of ketamine HCl, 100 mg/ml (Fort Dodge Animal Health); 2.5 ml of xylazine, 20 mg/ml (Vedco); 1 ml of acepromazine, 10 mg/ml (Vedco); and 1.5 ml of 0.9% saline solution] and placed in a stereotaxic device. Rat NPY siRNA (L090209), DBH siRNA (L090166), and control nontargeting siRNA (ntRNA; D001810) were purchased from Dharmacon. Each targeted siRNA was a mixture of 4 siRNAs formulated to enhance the effectiveness of the mixture in knockdown the target gene. The control ntRNA was mixture of siRNAs with scrambled sequences, confirmed by microarray to have minimal targeting of known genes in human, mouse, and rat cells. siRNAs were dissolved in distilled water (pH = 7.4). Unilateral or bilateral injections (200 nl/site) were delivered slowly over a 5 min period into the target hindbrain region through a pulled glass capillary pipette (30 \u03bcm external tip diameter) using a Picospritzer (Parker). For A1/C1 injection, the capillary pipette was positioned just dorsal to the targeted site at the occipital suture \u00b1 4.0 mm lateral to midline and 8.6 mm ventral to the skull surface, using an angled (15\u00b0) approach (Paxinos and Watson, 1997). For determining the regional specificity of the gene silencing, one group of rats was injected with siRNA mixture outside the targeted A1/C1 site (i.e., 8.0 mm ventral to skull surface). The dose of siRNAs (0.02 nmol) was determined from previous report (Chen et al., 2006) and our preliminary experiments (see Results for details).For glucoprivic feeding tests, rats were injected subcutaneously with 2DG (200 mg/kg body weight in 0.9% sterile saline; Sigma-Aldrich) or with 0.9% sterile saline vehicle as control. Then food intake was measured during the subsequent 4 h. Hyperglycemic responses to glucoprivation were measured in separate tests in the absence of food. Glucose was measured using a FreeStyle glucose monitor (Abbott Diabetes Care) from tail blood collected 15 min before and 90 min after a subcutaneous 2DG (200 mg/kg) injection. Previous studies have shown that the hyperglycemic response peaks at this time point after 2DG injection (Ritter et al., 2001, 2003). Blood glucose tests were conducted in the absence of food, which was removed 2 h before the start of the test. For lipoprivic feeding tests, rats were injected with \u03b2-mercaptoacetate (MA), which inhibits mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids (Bauch\u00e9 et al., 1981, 1983) and stimulates food intake over a time course similar to glucoprivation (Scharrer and Langhans, 1986; Ritter and Taylor, 1989). For this test, MA (68 mg/kg body weight in 0.9% sterile saline; Sigma-Aldrich) or 0.9% sterile saline (control) were injected intraperitoneally and intake of the standard pelleted maintenance diet was measured during the subsequent 4 h period, as described in our previous work (Ritter et al., 2001; Bugarith et al., 2005). All feeding and blood glucose measurements were performed between 3 and 7 d after siRNA injection, when suppression of gene expression was maximal (see Results for details). Each rat was tested in one or two of the three 2DG tests (saline-induced feeding, 2DG-induced feeding, or 2DG-induced hyperglycemia), or in both MA tests (saline-induced feeding and MA-induced feeding) during this period. Tests were separated by at least 2 d.To confirm siRNA silencing of targeted gene expression, the protein product of the gene was detected using immunohistochemistry (IHC). On the day after the last behavioral test, rats were killed by deep anesthesia with halothane (Halocarbon Laboratories). Just before cessation of the heartbeat, rats were perfused transcardially with cold PBS, pH 7.4, followed by freshly made cold 4% formaldehyde in PBS. After perfusion, brains were rapidly removed and placed in 4% formaldehyde/PBS at 4\u00b0C for overnight, then transferred to 12.5% and 25% sucrose in PBS for 24 h each. The hindbrains were sectioned coronally on a cryostat at 40 \u03bcm thickness and collected into four serial sets for IHC.IHC staining was performed using standard avidin-biotin-peroxidase techniques as described previously (Bugarith et al., 2005; Li et al., 2006). Briefly, sections were treated with 50% ethanol for 25 min. After incubation in 10% normal horse serum (NHS) in PBS for 30 min, the sections were incubated for 3 d in mouse monoclonal anti-DBH (1:40,000; Millipore) or rabbit anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (1:6000; Millipore) in 10% NHS/PBS at 4\u00b0C, or rabbit anti-NPY (1:4000; ImmunoStar) at room temperature for 1 d. After washing with PBS, sections were incubated in biotinylated donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) made in 1% NHS for overnight (16\u201317 h). After incubation with ExtrAvidin-Peroxidase (1:1500; Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 h, sections were washed and reacted for visualization of the immunoreactivity using diaminobenzidine or nickel-intensified diaminobenzidine in a peroxidase reaction to produce a brown or gray/black reaction product, respectively.To examine effects of NPY gene silencing on NPY peptide expression, rats were anesthetized using 1.0 ml/kg body weight of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine mixture. A lateral ventricle cannula was implanted (1.0 mm rostral to bregma, 1.5 mm lateral to midline, and 3.9 mm ventral to brain surface (Paxinos and Watson, 1997) for later injection of colchicine. Then NPY siRNA (0.02 nmol) was injected unilaterally into A1/C1, and ntRNA was injected into the contralateral A1/C1. One day before they were killed, rats were injected with colchicine (90 \u03bcg in 9 \u03bcl of saline; Sigma-Aldrich) into the lateral ventricle.To assess the efficacy, selectivity and area of gene silencing, cell bodies expressing the protein product of the targeted genes (i.e.,  and ) were quantified. In addition, cell bodies expressing TH were quantified in the same areas. TH is a biosynthetic enzyme upstream of DBH, which is involved in the synthesis of all catecholamines. Hence, TH can be used as a marker for DBH-expressing neurons that can be detected even when DBH protein expression is suppressed. Furthermore,  can be used in PCR or IHC studies to normalize  and  expression levels. For each rat, DBH-, NPY- and TH-expressing cell bodies were counted bilaterally in three consecutive coronal sections (from one of four parallel sets of sections) at each of the following anatomical levels (distance in mm) (Paxinos and Watson, 1997): A1 at 14.5\u201314.1; A1/C1 at 13.5\u201313.1; C1m at 12.6\u201312.2; and C2 at 12.8\u201312.4. Thus, we quantified cells in the targeted site (A1/C1) and in areas of the ventrolateral medulla (VLM) immediately caudal to (A1) and immediately rostral to (C1m) the targeted site. Intensity of DBH and NPY protein expression in detectable A1/C1 cells was also analyzed after unilateral injection of siRNA or ntRNA. Intensity was measured in optical density using Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics). The intensity of DBH or NPY immunoreactivity in soma of individual cells (after subtraction of background) and the size (area) of soma of detectable cells in A1/C1 were compared between ntRNA- and siRNA-injected sides.Real-time PCR was used to measure the changes of mRNA levels in dissected VLM tissues after NPY siRNA (0.02 nmol) or DBH siRNA (0.02 nmol) injection into A1/C1. Rats, 24, 48 or 72 h after siRNA injection into one side of A1/C1 area (the other side was injected with control nontargeting siRNA), were anesthetized deeply with halothane (Halocarbon Laboratories), and were quickly decapitated. The brain was removed and frozen on dry ice. A 2.0-mm-thick coronal slice was cut using obex (defined here as the caudal border of the area postrema) to locate the caudal border of the slice (0\u20132.0-mm-rostral to obex). Desired regions of the VLM, including A1/C1, were punched from the slice with a needle having a 1 mm inner diameter. Punched samples were quickly placed into TRIzol (Invitrogen) for total RNA isolation. DNase I-treated total RNA (0.3 \u03bcg) was reverse transcribed with oligo(dT)20 primer using Superscript III (Invitrogen) for first-strand cDNA synthesis. PCR Primers were designed using Primer3 software (http://fokker.wi.mit.edu/primer3/input.htm), and if possible an intron was spanned. Standard curve and efficiency analysis of each primer pairs were performed with a primers efficiency >90%. The sequences of primers used are: for rat , 5\u2032-aga gat cca gcc ctg aga ca-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-ttt cat ttc cca tca cca ca-3\u2032; for rat , 5\u2032-aca cag cgg aag aga ttg ct-3\u2032, and 5\u2032-gga tgc tgt cct ctc ggt ag-3\u2032. The real-time PCR was performed in triplicate using the Platinum Quantitative PCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen) with 4 \u03bcl of diluted cDNA (1:3 with water) in a final reaction volume of 25 \u03bcl. The amplification was followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 15 s, annealing at 58\u00b0C for 15 s and extension at 72\u00b0C for 15 s. Finally, a melting curve was generated by stepwise increases in temperature (0.5\u00b0C increase every 10 s) for 80 cycles starting at 56\u00b0C. The threshold cycle (Ct) was determined using SYBR Green fluorescence with iCycler iQ software (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Gene expression was evaluated by means of a comparative Ct method and normalized to  expression. Because of very low expression levels of DBH mRNA in the dissected tissue, we could not get reliable data for DBH mRNA levels in the present study. The dissociation curves of each primer pair used in this study showed a single peak and the samples tested after the PCRs had a single expected DNA band on agarose gels.All results are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. For statistical analysis of data, we used a paired or unpaired  test or one-way ANOVA. After significance was determined using one-way ANOVA, multiple comparisons between individual groups were tested using a  Bonferroni  test.  < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.Preliminary studies to assess the effectiveness of siRNAs on silencing of targeted gene expression showed that 2\u20133 d after the injection of 0.01\u20130.02 nmol of siRNA into the C2 cell group, the number of DBH-positive neurons in the DBH siRNA injection side was only 46.8% of the number present on the contralateral control side injected with ntRNA (11.0 \u00b1 0.9 vs 23.5 \u00b1 1.0;  < 0.0001). A higher dose (0.04 nmol) produced no greater effect. Therefore, 0.02 nmol was used in the all subsequent studies.Results showing the time course of siRNAs on  expression, analyzed with real time PCR and normalized to TH mRNA, are shown in Table 1. NPY mRNA levels in VLM tissue samples containing the A1/C1 injection site were significantly reduced on the side injected with NPY siRNA, compared with the side injected with ntRNA control. NPY mRNA levels were reduced 1 and 2 d, but not 3 d, after injection. PCR results were not reliable for DBH mRNA because of the very low levels of gene expression in the homogenized hindbrain tissue.Expression levels of NPY mRNA in A1/C1 regionThe effect of siRNAs on the protein products of the targeted genes, as detected using IHC, is shown in Figure 1 and Tables 2 and 3. Three days after injection into A1/C1, the number of DBH-positive cells in A1/C1 on the side injected with DBH siRNA was only 42.7% of the number present on the side injected with ntRNA. The effect of DBH siRNA on DBH protein was still present 8 d after the injection, but showed some recovery (57.0% of the control side). The inhibition of DBH expression was limited to the A1/C1 region, as numbers of DBH-positive cells in DBH siRNA- and control ntRNA-injected sides were similar in A1 and C1m areas bordering the A1/C1 injection site (Table 2). As shown in Table 3 and Figure 1, NPY siRNA injected into A1/C1 in colchicine-treated rats inhibited NPY expression in A1/C1 3\u20134 d, and 7\u20138 d after the injection, compared with the contralateral A1/C1, injected with ntRNA. NPY siRNA-induced inhibition of NPY expression was limited to the A1/C1 region. In the A1 and C1m regions bordering A1/C1, the numbers of NPY-positive cells did not differ between the NPY siRNA and control-injected sides (Table 3). Not only was there a reduction in the number of immunoreactive cells that were visible after siRNA injection, but the intensity of DBH and NPY immunoreactivity in the visible cells was also decreased by siRNA injection into A1/C1. Quantitative data showed that 3 d after the injection the mean optical density of DBH expression in A1/C1 soma on the DBH siRNA-injected side was 4412.9 \u00b1 188.5 (mean of 123 neurons), compared with 6220.1 \u00b1 247.9 (mean of 146 neurons) on the ntRNA-injected side (a 29.1% decrease from the ntRNA side;  < 0.001), whereas the size (area) of soma was similar between them (51.8 \u00b1 1.3 \u03bcm2 on the DBH siRNA-injected side vs 51.0 \u00b1 1.6 \u03bcm2 on the ntRNA-injected side;  > 0.7). NPY intensity in soma showed a similar decrease (32.2%) at 3\u20134 d after NPY siRNA injection; i.e., from 2903.5 \u00b1 90.5 on the ntRNA side ( = 85 neurons) to 1967.8 \u00b1 119.2 on the NPY siRNA side ( = 48 neurons;  < 0.001). Again, the mean size (area) of the visible immunoreactive soma was not altered by the injection (47.2 \u00b1 1.3 \u03bcm2 for the ntRNA side and 50.6 \u00b1 1.7 \u03bcm2 for the NPY siRNA side,  > 0.1).Representative IHC images showing expression of DBH or NPY protein in the A1/C1 region in coronal hindbrain sections from rats injected unilaterally into A1/C1 with DBH siRNA (0.02 nmol), or NPY siRNA (0.02 nmol). Control ntRNA (0.02 nmol) was injected contralaterally into A1/C1. Images show tissue obtained 3 d (for DBH siRNA) or 4 d (for NPY siRNA) after A1/C1 injections. DBH siRNA and NPY siRNA significantly decreased the target gene expression (see quantitative data in Table 2 and 3). Scale bar, 0.1 mm.Numbers of DBH-positive cells in hindbrain regionsNumbers of NPY-positive cells in hindbrain regionsBased on the preliminary findings discussed above, 2DG-induced feeding and hyperglycemia were tested between 3 and 7 d after bilateral siRNA injection, the time in which gene silencing was demonstrated.Bilateral injections of either NPY siRNA or DBH siRNA (0.02 nmol) into A1/C1 had no effect on 2DG-induced feeding. As shown in Figure 2, 2DG significantly increased feeding in all groups during the 4-h test, but NPY and DBH siRNA-injected rats did not differ in their intake from ntRNA controls ( = 5\u20136 rats for each group; Ps >0.6 between groups). 2DG increased blood glucose levels significantly above baseline in all groups at the 90 min sampling time ( = 5 \u2013 6/group) but there were no differences between groups either before ( > 0.8) or 90 min after ( > 0.9) 2DG injection (Fig. 2).Effect of single siRNA injection on glucoprivic responses and target gene expression.  shows the effect of NPY siRNA, DBH siRNA, or control ntRNA injected bilaterally into A1/C1 (0.02 nmol/side), on 4 h saline- or 2DG (200 mg/kg)-induced feeding. Food intake was increased significantly above saline baseline by 2DG, but there were no significant between-group differences either in the response to 2DG or in baseline feeding.  shows effects of the same treatments on 2DG-induced hyperglycemia. Blood glucose was measured 15 min before (Pre) and 90 min after (Post) 2DG injection. Blood glucose levels were significantly increased above baseline by 2DG, but there were no significant differences between groups. , Numbers of DBH- and TH-positive cells in A1/C1 as determined by quantification of IHC. Data were obtained from rats used in the above feeding and blood glucose tests. DBH siRNA significantly inhibited DBH expression, but not TH expression, in A1/C1 region. ** < 0.001 (vs control).Immunohistochemical results from these same animals are shown in Figure 2. Cell counts indicate that injections of DBH siRNA ( = 7) into A1/C1 decreased the number of DBH-positive cells in the A1/C1 area to 58.7% of the number present in anatomically equivalent area in the ntRNA controls ( = 7;  < 0.001, vs the control, Bonferroni  test). Injection of NPY siRNA did not significantly reduce DBH-positive cell numbers, which were 85.4% of the number in ntRNA control rats ( = 6;  > 0.1). Neither DBH siRNA nor NPY siRNA had effects on the numbers of TH-positive cells in A1/C1 ( > 0.1 between groups), indicating that the injections did not alter  expression or destroy the targeted neurons.In contrast to separate injections of NPY and DBH siRNAs, which produced no effects of feeding or blood glucose responses to 2DG, simultaneous injection of NPY siRNA and DBH siRNA caused a significant reduction in the feeding response (Fig. 3). Food intake was increased significantly by 2DG in rats injected with ntRNA ( = 6 rats), whereas the feeding in rats injected with DBH + NPY siRNAs ( = 7) was only 39.2% of the control intake ( < 0.002; vs the control rats by Bonferroni  test after one-way ANOVA). The rats with the same mixture of siRNAs, but injected outside the A1/C1 area (Fig. 3, \u201cMissed\u201d group), did not differ in their intake from the ntRNA controls ( = 6;  > 0.9 between groups). All rats ate similar amounts of food after saline injection ( = 4\u20137 rats;  > 0.4 between groups). As shown in Figure 3, blood glucose levels were elevated in all rats after 2DG injection and there were no differences between groups either 15 min before or 90 min after the 2DG injection ( = 3\u20137 rats; Ps >0.3 among groups).Effect of combined NPY siRNA and DBH siRNA injection on glucoprivic responses and target gene expression.  shows the effect of DBH siRNA (0.02 nmol) + NPY siRNA (0.02 nmol) (mixed siRNAs) or control ntRNA injected bilaterally into A1/C1, and the effect of the mixed siRNAs injected more dorsally to miss the A1/C1 area (Missed siRNAs), on 4 h saline- or 2DG (200 mg/kg)-induced feeding. Combined siRNAs injected into A1/C1 reduced the 2DG feeding response. ** < 0.001 (vs control).  shows the effect of the same treatments on 2DG-induced hyperglycemia. Glucose levels were measured 15 min before (Pre) and 90 min after (Post) 2DG injection. Blood glucose was significantly increased by 2DG in all groups, but no significant between-group differences were observed. , Numbers of DBH- and TH-positive cells in A1/C1 by IHC, quantified from rats used in the 2DG tests. DBH siRNA/NPY siRNA mixture injected into A1/C1 significantly inhibited DBH expression, but not TH expression in A1/C1 region. ** < 0.001 (vs control).Immunohistochemical analysis of rats used in the feeding and glucose tests, show that the number of DBH-positive cells in the A1/C1 in rats injected with the combined NPY + DBH siRNAs was only 56.5% of the ntRNA control ( < 0.001), as shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4, whereas numbers of TH-positive cells in A1/C1 were not significantly different among those groups ( = 5\u201310 rats for each group;  > 0.5 among groups), demonstrating that the injections did not lesion cells at the injection site.Representative IHC images showing DBH and TH protein expression in A1/C1 in coronal hindbrain sections. A mixture of DBH siRNA and NPY siRNA (each 0.02 nmol), or control ntRNA was injected bilaterally into A1/C1. Images were obtained from rats used in Figure 3. The mixture of siRNAs significantly decreased DBH expression without reducing TH expression, when compared with controls injected with ntRNA. Scale bar, 0.1 mm.MA significantly increased food intake above saline baseline both in ntRNA-injected rats ( = 7) and in rats injected with DBH + NPY siRNAs ( = 7) (Ps >0.002; vs saline control) (Fig. 5). There were no significant differences between these two groups either after MA or saline injection (Ps >0.8).Effect of combined NPY and DBH siRNA injection on lipoprivic feeding and target gene expression.  shows the effect of DBH siRNA (0.02 nmol) + NPY siRNA (0.02 nmol) (Mixed siRNAs) or control ntRNA injected bilaterally into A1/C1 on 4 h saline- or MA (68 mg/kg)-induced feeding. MA-induced feeding did not differ between the combined siRNA- and ntRNA-injected rats.  shows numbers of DBH- and TH-immunoreactive cells in A1/C1, quantified from rats used in lipoprivic feeding tests. DBH siRNA/NPY siRNA mixture injected into A1/C1 significantly inhibited DBH expression, but not TH expression in A1/C1 region. ** < 0.001 (vs control).Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the number of DBH-positive cells in A1/C1 in rats injected with the combined NPY + DBH siRNAs was 59.6% of the ntRNA control ( < 0.001) (Fig. 5), whereas numbers of TH-positive cells in A1/C1 were not significantly different between groups ( > 0.9).In the present study, we injected naked siRNAs, without transfection reagents or viral vectors, into A1/C1 cell group to target  and . We found that both NPY siRNA and DBH siRNA produced effective, selective and reversible silencing of the targeted genes that was limited to the injection site. Specificity of siRNAs in reducing target gene expression was demonstrated by results showing that immunoreactivity for TH, which is present in all A1/C1 neurons, was not reduced by either single or combined injection of NPY or DBH siRNAs. Silencing of gene expression was localized to the A1/C1 injection site. Targeted genes in immediately adjacent A1 and C1m were not suppressed, as indicated by the normal expression of their protein products. Gene silencing by NPY siRNA or DBH siRNA was reversible. NPY mRNA levels recovered after 3 d, whereas inhibition of NPY and DBH protein expression persisted >1 week. These observations are consistent with other published studies showing reversible silencing of gene expression after single injections of naked siRNA into the brain (Makimura et al., 2002; Akaneya et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2006). We found that localized silencing of  and  expression in A1/C1 significantly reduced the feeding response to systemic 2DG-induced glucoprivation. Only injection of the combined siRNAs was effective. Separate silencing of either the  or  alone did not reduce the feeding response. Furthermore, MA-induced feeding was normal in the combined siRNA-injected rats, suggesting that the response to glucoprivation was not reduced by a nonspecific behavioral impairment. These results indicate that catecholamines and NPY, which are coexpressed in A1/C1 neurons, act conjointly in controlling glucoprivic feeding. The hyperglycemic response to 2DG was not impaired, indicating that A1/C1 neurons are not required for this response, as indicated by other data (Ritter et al., 2001).The results of this study add to the increasing evidence that feeding triggered by glucose deficit requires DBH/NPY coexpressing neurons. Studies using mice with deletions of  and  have shown that deletion of either gene impairs, but does not abolish, the feeding response (Ste Marie and Palmiter, 2003). Hindbrain, but not arcuate, NPY neurons appear to be those required for glucoprivic feeding. Lesion of NPY/agouti-related peptide (AGRP) neurons in the arcuate nucleus using NPY-saporin (Bugarith et al., 2005) or deletion of these neurons in mice by genetic insertion of the human diphtheria toxin receptor (heparin-binding epidermal growth factor) targeted to  locus (Luquet et al., 2007) does not impair glucoprivic feeding, whereas lesion of hindbrain catecholamine/NPY neurons using PVH injections of the selective retrogradely transported immunotoxin, anti-DBH-saporin, abolishes the feeding response (Ritter et al., 2001). Moreover, hindbrain catecholamine innervation of the medial hypothalamus is required for glucoprivation-induced increases in hypothalamic NPY and AGRP mRNA expression (Fraley and Ritter, 2003). Identification of NPY as a critical comediator of glucoprivic feeding facilitates localization of the particular neurons involved, and was central to the hypothesis tested in this experiment, because a large percentage of neurons of this phenotype are located in A1/C1 (Sawchenko et al., 1985). The effects we have observed with gene silencing now provide definitive evidence that NPY and catecholamines in A1/C1 neurons are required for glucoprivic feeding and that corelease of both is essential for the normal function of these neurons.It has long been know that both catecholamines and NPY are potent orexigens when injected singly into the brain (Ritter et al., 1975; Stanley and Leibowitz, 1984; 1985; Leibowitz et al., 1988; Taylor et al., 2007) and that acute pharmacological blockade of catecholamine neurotransmission (M\u00fcller et al., 1972) or injection of anti-NPY antibody into the PVH (He et al., 1998) impairs glucoprivic feeding. Similarly, the coexpression of NPY in hindbrain Epi and NE neurons that innervate the hypothalamus has been known for many years (Sawchenko et al., 1985). However, the question of how these coreleased substances interact to influence feeding has not been addressed. At vascular neuroeffector junctions peripheral sympathetic terminals costore NPY and NE in the large dense-core vesicles and corelease them on electrical stimulation (Fried et al., 1985; De Potter et al., 1988, 1997). Corelease induces vasoconstriction. When NPY and NE are administrated together in human vascular biopsies, NPY dramatically potentiates the NE-evoked vessel constriction through an NPY receptor-dependent mechanism (Donoso et al., 2004a,b; Huidobro-Toro and Donoso, 2004). In the supraoptic nucleus, substance P and NPY, coreleased by some catecholamine terminals in that site, differentially potentiate Epi-induced vasopressin and oxytocin secretion (Kapoor and Sladek, 2001). Additional work will be required to determine the mechanism and nature of the interaction between coreleased NPY and catecholamines at central terminals controlling food intake.The fact that 2DG, but not MA-induced feeding, was impaired by  gene silencing is consistent with several lines of research indicating that 2DG and MA stimulate feeding by distinct metabolic signal processing and by the effects of those signals on distinct neural pathways. Elimination of capsaicin-sensitive vagal sensory neurons (Ritter and Taylor, 1989) or surgical subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (Ritter and Taylor, 1990) abolishes MA-, but not 2DG-, induced feeding. Anti-DBH-saporin lesion of hindbrain catecholamine neuron subpopulations abolishes 2DG-, but not MA-, induced feeding (Ritter et al., 2001). Furthermore, administration of low suprathreshold doses of 2DG and MA are almost precisely additive, and capsaicin treatment blocks only the MA component of the additive response (Ritter and Taylor, 1989). Electrolytic lesions in the lateral parabrachial nucleus or central nucleus of the amygdala abolish MA-, but not 2DG-, induced feeding (Calingasan and Ritter, 1993; Ritter and Hutton, 1995). Finally, MA and 2DG elicit different patterns of gene expression in hypothalamic feeding-regulatory sites (Sergeyev et al., 2000). Thus, the present results emphasize the specific importance of A1/C1 neurons for the glucoprivic feeding response, and in addition, highlight an organizational strategy within the brain for independent processing of distinct metabolic signals.The level of  and  gene silencing achieved in our study was \u223c50%, as indicated by real-time PCR and IHC, respectively. We found that increasing the amount of injected siRNA did not significantly increase gene silencing. Similar levels of mRNA depletion have been reported in previous studies using either single injection or continuous infusion of siRNA into the brain (Makimura et al., 2002; Thakkar et al., 2003; Thakker et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2006). This incomplete gene silencing may be the result of degradation of siRNA at the injection site and/or limited penetration of siRNA into cells. Alternatively, the diffusion radius of our 200 nl siRNA injection may have been inadequate to silence the gene throughout A1/C1.The amount of gene silencing achieved by our approach was clearly adequate to suppress the glucoprivic feeding response to only 37% of control. Nevertheless, the feeding response was not completely blocked and this may be a result that should not be overlooked. Of course, incomplete response suppression may be attributable to incomplete silencing of  and  expression. However, two additional and potentially important factors may also be accountable. First, there may be NPY/catecholamine neurons in other cell groups that contribute to the feeding response and that continue to function normally during gene silencing of the A1/C1 population. Cells in C1m, C2 and C3 would be likely contributors. These groups include cell bodies that coexpress NPY, are activated by glucoprivation, and that project to the hypothalamus. Second, there may be an additional coexpressed substance in the A1/C1 neurons capable of mediating a limited response, even when NPY and catecholamine production in these same cells is suppressed. For example, glutamate (Stornetta et al., 2002), ATP (Kennedy et al., 1996) and cocaine- and amphetamine-related transcript (Dun et al., 2002) are coexpressed in certain catecholamine neurons, supporting the possibility that additional comediators may be present in the A1/C1 catecholamine neurons involved in glucoprivic feeding.Injection of anti-DBH-saporin into the ventral hindbrain, causing extensive (>80%) loss of catecholamine neurons throughout the rostral VLM, attenuates the hyperglycemic response to systemic glucoprivation (Madden et al., 2006). However, silencing of  and  expression in A1/C1 did not impair the 2DG-induced hyperglycemic response. It is likely that this result is attributable to the narrow targeting of our injections to the A1/C1 region. Spinally projecting catecholamine neurons mediate this response and the A1/C1 cell group does not contain spinally projecting neurons (Sawchenko et al., 1985; Ritter et al., 2001). Although such neurons are present in C1m and C1r, neither  and  or their protein products were suppressed in contiguous A1 and C1m regions with our injection parameters. Therefore, A1/C1 neurons can be ruled out as being essential for direct control of blood glucose, but a role for spinally projecting NPY/catecholamine coexpressing neurons in other sites, such as C1m, C2 or C3, cannot yet be ruled out (Minson et al., 1994; Stornetta et al., 1999). Alternatively, NPY may not be involved in this response. Rather, other neuroactive substances may comediate the adrenal medullary response to glucoprivation. Glutamate is a particularly interesting candidate for this role because nearly all bulbospinal Epi neurons coexpress glutamate, and glutamate activates presympathetic neurons more robustly than Epi (Morrison, 2003).This work was supported by Public Health Service Grants DK 40498 and NS 4552004 to S.R.Thank you for sharing this Journal of Neuroscience article.NOTE: We request your email address only to inform the recipient that it was you who recommended this article, and that it is not junk mail.

Based on such anatomic observations, early proposals have attributed a role in \u201cgain control\u201d for GCs, a function disputed by recent investigations, which assert that GCs instead contribute to oscillatory mechanisms. However, conclusive physiological evidence based on studies of cerebellum-dependent behavior supporting/dismissing the gain control proposition has been lacking as of yet. We addressed the possible function of this interneuron by recording the activity of a large number of both MFs and GCs during saccadic eye movements from the same cortical area of the monkey cerebellum, namely the oculomotor vermis (OMV). Our cellular identification conformed to previously established criteria, mainly to juxtacellular labeling studies correlating physiological parameters with cell morphology. Response patterns of both MFs and GCs were highly heterogeneous. MF discharges correlated linearly with eye saccade metrics and timing, showing directional preference and precise direction tuning. In contrast, GC discharges did not correlate strongly with the metrics or direction of movement. Their discharge properties were also unaffected by motor learning during saccadic adaptation. The OMV therefore receives a barrage of information about eye movements from different oculomotor areas over the MF pathway, which is not reflected in GCs. The unspecificity of GCs has important implications for the intricacies of neuronal processing in the granular layer, clearly discrediting their involvement in gain control and instead suggesting a more secluded role for these interneurons.The cerebellar cortex is anatomically organized in three distinct layers: the molecular layer, the Purkinje cell (PC) layer and the granular layer (see Fig. 1). The pathways carrying the two known inputs to the cerebellum [climbing fibers and mossy fibers (MFs)] converge at the level of Purkinje cells, which in turn provide the only output of the cerebellar cortex, with their axons terminating in the deep cerebellar and vestibular nuclei.Whereas the climbing fibers excite the PCs and possibly some interneurons directly, the MF pathway to PC dendrites is indirect. The MF afferents first synapse with cellular elements in the granular layer before the information is transmitted to the PCs via parallel fibers (for a review, see Ito, 2006). Golgi cells (GCs) process the information carried by MFs to the cerebellum before this signal reaches the PC layer. They are the most numerous interneurons in the granular layer [apart from granule cells (GrC)] (Simat et al., 2007), have comparatively larger somata than other interneurons (Barmack and Yakhnitsa, 2008), receive direct excitation from both parallel and mossy fibers (Palay and Chan-Palay, 1974), and in turn exhibit an exclusive inhibition of thousands of GrCs (H\u00e1mori and Szent\u00e1gothai, 1966). The GCs could also potentially modulate the MF signals directly, namely by spillover of GABA through GABAB receptors found on MF rosettes (Mitchell and Silver, 2000).Early studies on the cerebellum (Eccles et al., 1967; Marr, 1969; Albus, 1971; Ito, 1984) postulated a number of concepts purely based on anatomical and theoretical considerations that greatly influenced subsequent investigations. One such concept was that cerebellar GCs perform gain control over the MF transmission to PCs [for a detailed discussion, see the study by De Schutter et al. (2000)]. In short, a greater excitation of GrCs by the MFs would lead to an increased inhibition of the same GrCs by the activated GCs, resulting, overall, in limiting the amount of excitation that is transmitted to the PCs. However, more recent physiological findings about cerebellar GCs (Dieudonne, 1998; Vos et al., 1999a, 1999b; Holtzman et al. 2006) have proven to be inconsistent with this classical view. Instead, they led to alternative concepts about their functional role, such as their implication in launching oscillatory mechanisms in the granular layer (Maex and De Schutter, 1998; De Schutter et al., 2000). Still, such propositions remain speculative. Very little is in fact known about the specific properties of or the role GCs might have, mainly because  recordings from animals involved in well controlled behaviors are lacking.Consequently, with the intention to shed more light on their properties and eventual function they might have in the cerebellar processing of information, we recorded from a substantial number of both GCs and MF terminals in the oculomotor vermis (OMV) (the narrow strip along the midline of lobules VIc and VIIa of the cerebellum), while monkeys executed visually guided saccades. Eye saccades, a model of cerebellum-dependent motor behavior, provide a comparative advantage over other types of motor behavior resulting from the small number of degrees of freedom and simpler kinematics-to-dynamics transformations.Two rhesus monkeys () A and N were prepared for eye position recording using the magnetic scleral search coil technique (Judge et al. 1980). To painlessly immobilize the monkeys' heads, a titanium pole was attached to the skull with titanium bone screws. Titanium was used for its high biocompatibility and for compatibility in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) settings. Recording chambers (also titanium) were implanted over the posterior part of the skull to gain access to the posterior cerebellum for extra-cellular recordings. The middle of the cylinder axis was aimed to the interaural position (0, 0, 0 in stereotaxic coordinates) and inclined by 40\u00b0 in the posterior direction about the axis perpendicular to the interaural plane. All surgical procedures were conducted under general anesthesia (introduced with ketamine and maintained by inhalation of isoflurane and nitrous oxide, supplemented by intravenous remifentanil) with control of vital parameters (body temperature, CO2, O2, blood pressure, electrocardiogram), followed the guidelines set by the National Institutes of Health and national law and were approved by the local committee supervising the handling of experimental animals. After the surgery, monkeys were supplied with analgetics until full recovery.During all behavioral tasks, the monkeys sat head-fixed in a primate chair in total darkness. They were trained to make saccadic eye movements to a white target dot (0.2\u00b0 diameter) displayed on a monitor screen positioned 42 cm in front of the animals. The eye position signal measured by the scleral search coil method was calibrated and sampled at 1 kHz. The monkey received an automatic liquid reward each time he successfully executed the eye saccade; i.e., maintained gaze inside an eye position window (\u00b11.5\u00b0) during initial fixation until the target jump, and displaced the eyes back inside the window and maintained fixation no later than 300 ms after the jump.To test for the directional preference of the recorded units, the monkeys executed visually guided saccades from an initial central fixation point toward targets located at 10\u00b0 eccentricity in eight different directions in the frontoparallel plane. We designated each direction by their angular polar coordinate. Directions included two horizontal (rightward: 0\u00b0 and leftward: 180\u00b0), two vertical (upward: 90\u00b0 and downward: 270\u00b0), and four diagonal (right-up: 45\u00b0, left-up: 135\u00b0, left-down: 225\u00b0, and right-down: 315\u00b0) directions. The monkeys initially fixated a central fixation point for 1000 ms, after which the peripheral target appeared with the simultaneous disappearance of the fixation target. After the saccadic eye movement, the monkeys had to fixate the peripheral target for 300\u2013500 ms. Target directions were randomly chosen from trial to trial.To test for the tuning of cells to saccades of different amplitudes, the animals executed visually guided saccades from a central fixation point toward targets at eight different peripheral eccentricities (from 2.5\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 in 2.5\u00b0 steps) in the single radial direction for which the neuron had preferentially responded. The central and peripheral fixation times were as in the directional selectivity paradigm. The target amplitude was randomly chosen for each trial.Saccades were adapted using the standard \u201cMcLaughlin\u201d paradigm (McLaughlin, 1967). The monkeys were asked to make saccades from a central fixation point toward a peripheral target in the preferred direction of the neuron and at a fixed eccentricity. During the execution of the saccade, the target spot was shifted either back toward the fixation point (inward adaptation) or in the direction away from it (outward adaptation). The monkey shifted its gaze to the initial target location and then produced a corrective saccade toward the shifted target. This procedure was repeated up to 1000 trials during which the monkey progressively learned to either decrease or increase the amplitude of the initial saccades [see the study by Catz et al. (2005) for examples illustrating saccadic adaptation]. The initial target amplitudes, as well as the sizes of target shifts, were varied between different adaptation sessions. The percentage of gain change was calculated as \u00b1|1-saccade_amplitude/initial_target_amplitude| \u00d7 100. Gain change percentiles were defined as positive for outward and negative for inward adaptation.Postsurgical MRI was used to facilitate the anatomic localization of cerebellar lobules VI and VIIa. The identification of this area was confirmed by extra-cellular recordings characterized by frequent saccade-related multiunit background bursts and a large number of saccade-related single units. All extra-cellular action potentials were recorded with commercially available glass-coated tungsten microelectrodes (Alpha Omega Engineering) with 1\u20132 M\u03a9 impedances that were driven to the cerebellum by means of a high precision motor (1 \u03bcm movement steps). Single units were isolated on-line with the Multi Spikes Detector software (Alpha Omega Engineering) by detecting and sorting waveforms according to shape. We did not attempt to discern what side of the OMV we were recording from.All analyses were performed off-line with custom programs compiled in Matlab (Mathworks). The recorded horizontal and vertical eye position traces were smoothed with a Savitzky-Golay filter (window = 10 points, polynomial degree = 4), which replaces the data points in the specified window by a polynomial regression fit of the chosen degree. With a window of 10 points and a fourth degree polynomial, the eye position data are low-pass filtered with a bandwidth of \u223c100 Hz, which is appropriate for frequencies of natural eye movements (20\u201330 Hz). Two-dimensional velocity vectors were computed and we used the 20 \u00b0/s velocity criterion for detecting saccade onset and end. Saccades with maximal velocity <100 \u00b0/s or with durations longer than 100 ms were discarded (this comprised <1% of saccades).We estimated the instantaneous firing rate of the recorded neurons with a continuous spike density function, generated by convoluting the spike train with a Gaussian function of width \u03c3 = 20 ms. A Poisson spike train analysis (Hanes et al., 1995) was applied to detect the time stamps of onset and end of bursts for the relevant neurons. This analysis relies on a surprise index (SI) defined as SI=\u2212log(), where  is given in Equation 1 and is the probability that, given a mean discharge rate  of the entire spike train being analyzed, a spike train of a time interval  contains  or more spikes. Burst peaks were then calculated as the maximum value of the estimated spike density function between these two time stamps.\n\n The sample average of the dependence of burst peaks on saccade amplitude (see Fig. 8,) was computed by first dividing the range of amplitudes for saccades in the preferred direction of the unit into 10 equally sized bins of 2\u00b0. Mean burst peaks were then calculated for each bin for each neuron. The average amplitude tuning data were then computed as the average of all the mean values in each bin across all neurons that had been tested at the amplitude represented by that particular bin. The population activity of all neurons (see Fig. 8,) was computed by dividing the range of saccade durations into 21 equally sized bins of 2 ms. Recorded spike trains were then assigned to their corresponding bins, and the population mean was computed so as to have each neuron contribute equally to the population response. The spike density function was estimated for the averaged spike trains in each bin as described above. The end of the population response in each bin was determined as the time when the burst decreased below a subjectively chosen value of five SDs above the mean of activity during the first 750 ms of fixation. Calculating population averages this way is not intended to have any anatomic significance, it is instead used as a pertinent method in capturing the temporal information conveyed by a particular group of neurons.We performed a Student's (when the two samples had equal variances) or Welch's (when the two samples had unequal variances)  test whenever we wished to evaluate whether two data samples come from the same distribution with equal means. Normality of data were tested with the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. We deemed the difference to be statistically significant when the probability ( value) of having distributions with equal means did not surpass the 5% level. Where appropriate, the computed  value was multiplied by the number of performed tests to correct for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni correction).Linear and quadratic fits to data points were computed using the method of least squares. The coefficient of determination 2 was used to evaluate how well the model fitted the data and the -statistic was calculated to evaluate the probability ( value) that all parameters in the model fit were equal to zero. Furthermore, the  test with 1 and 2 degrees of freedom was performed to evaluate whether fitting the data with a quadratic rather than a linear model was justified. The  test gives the probability ( value) that the model with added parameters yields the same noise variance as the initial linear one. We deemed the quadratic model as being justified when the probability of having the same noise variance was <5%.The directional tuning curves shown in Figure 5 were intended for a qualitative description only and were least squares fits to the data points using Equation 2 with  = 4 (\u03b2 are the free parameters, \u03c4 the angle in radians is the independent variable). This polar equation produces a periodic smooth curve that passes through the eight data points in a polar plot, as follows:\n\n for\n\n\n\n Nonlinear regression was used to fit Gaussian curves to the directional data (see Figs. 5, 6). Perisaccadic activity was computed as the average spike density from 50 ms before saccade onset until 200 ms after saccade onset, and activity during central fixation was computed as average spike density from 500 to 200 ms before saccade onset. The perisaccadic data were first normalized by subtracting the mean activity during central fixation and then by dividing all the points by the maximum (or minimum for pausing units) value. Accordingly, in the normalized perisaccadic activity ratios (see Figs. 5, 6), a value of one indicates maximum (or minimum for pausing units) activity, and the zero level corresponds to the baseline activity (during central fixation). The goodness of fit was evaluated uniquely by the coefficient of determination 2, and a Gaussian fit was deemed to be inappropriate when 95% confidence intervals on the estimated parameters were unreasonable. The preferred direction of each tested neuron was defined to be the angular value corresponding to the peak of the fitted Gaussian curve; only where a Gaussian fit was judged appropriate.Before any attempt in trying to record action potentials from specific neuronal types, we made sure that the recording electrode was situated in the granular layer. The PC layer was used as a landmark for this purpose (Fig. 1). PCs were readily identified by the simultaneous presence of simple and complex spikes (Eccles et al. 1967; Thach 1968) (Fig. 2). Further advancing the electrode past the PC layer, depending on the orientation of the cerebellar folia, either the molecular or the granular layer could be encountered. The molecular layer was characterized by prominent complex spikes with any other action potentials being highly infrequent (Fig. 2). Otherwise, if the electrode was advanced into the granular layer, complex spikes disappeared completely and action potentials from other cellular elements could be encountered and clearly isolated, albeit less frequently than in the PC layer, where the large-sized neurons are more densely distributed (Fig. 2). Another important criterion which permitted the distinction between granular and molecular layers was the beehive-like saccade-related background activity. Whereas the molecular layer remained relatively silent, saccade-related multiunit activity often dominated the background of the granular layer. These criteria are in line with previous electrophysiological identification of cerebellar layers confirmed by histological verification of electrolytic lesion sites in monkeys (Miles et al., 1980; van Kan et al. 1993).Schematic of the cerebellar cortex organization.

Insets, Enlarged waveforms of spikes pointed to by the arrows.With the recording electrode located in the granular layer of the OMV, GCs were recognized mainly on the basis of a unique electrophysiological signature established by Barmack and Yakhnitsa (2008) (in the mouse cerebellum), and Holtzman et al. (2006) and Simpson et al. (2005) (in the rat cerebellum) who compared a number of electrophysiological parameters based on extracellular recordings with the morphology of cells as revealed by subsequent juxtacellular labeling. In accordance with these studies, units we identified as GCs were characterized by the absence of complex spikes and by action potentials that all showed tonic activity at rest with low mean firing frequencies (2\u201330 Hz), distinctive interspike interval (ISI) histogram shapes lacking high frequency components (Fig. 3) and well pronounced, long (> 1 ms) and di/tri-phasic action potential wave shapes (Fig. 3). In accordance with previous work (Holtzman et al., 2006), a comparison of the ISI distributions of individual cells we identified as either Golgi or Purkinje revealed that the two types of units possessed different discharge properties at rest (Fig. 3). Whereas median ISI values of GCs covered a wide range of intervals, those of PCs fell into a much narrower range of 5 to 40 ms with very little overlap between the distributions of median ISIs of the two populations of neurons. This comparison provides an additional guideline for distinguishing GCs from the PC simple spike discharges when the latter is not necessarily accompanied by complex spikes., Exemplary ISI histograms characterizing individual Golgi cells and unipolar brush cells. , Comparison between median ISI values of Golgi and Purkinje cells. , Comparison between typical action potential wave shapes recorded from Golgi cells and mossy fibers. , Distribution of action potential durations calculated from 10 randomly chosen UBCs, Golgi cells (G), Purkinje cells (P), and MF. Durations were measured from the beginning of the wave, up to the last moment the wave again crossed the initial level (the long negative rebound period was not included). The thick black line indicates mean values, short delimiters the SD, and long delimiters the full data range. The distribution of action potential durations of all units are compared with that of Golgi cells; * < 0.03, ** < 10\u22127.Other cellular elements that could give rise to action potentials in the granular layer include GrCs, unipolar brush cells (UBC), Lugaro cells, and MF terminals. More often than the putative GCs, we encountered very short and faint action potentials rather randomly in the granular layer (Fig. 3). They were often followed by a negative after-wave (NAW) and were difficult to keep isolated for longer times. Based on previous similar descriptions from awake monkey recordings (Kase et al., 1980; Miles et al. 1980; Ohtsuka and Noda, 1992; van Kan et al. 1993), we assigned these action potentials to be emanating from MF terminals. The ISI histograms computed for these units were, however, highly diverse and unlike for GCs, typical histograms exemplifying the putative MFs could not be provided. The main criteria for identifying MFs (with the electrode in the granular layer) were either the presence of the NAW, or action potential durations significantly shorter than those of units thought to reflect cellular elements (Fig. 3). van Kan et al. (1993) furthermore confirmed this identification by asynaptic activation of such units from electrical stimuli of the peduncle. We excluded GrCs as the possible origin of such potentials because the size of their somata (4\u20136 \u03bcm) seems to be much smaller than that of MF rosettes, which makes their recording possible only if high impedance electrodes (>15 M\u03a9) are used (Barmack and Yakhnitsa, 2008). Climbing fibers that branch through the granular layer are also excluded as possible sources because, in addition to being \u223c50 times less frequent than MFs (Ito, 1984), they fire at very low rates (0.5\u20132 Hz) (Thach, 1968), unlike the high frequency bursts we recorded.The units we identified as GCs could potentially also be mistaken for UBCs or Lugaro cells, the other two large-sized interneurons of the granular layer. Luckily, UBCs have been identified and characterized in juxtacellular labeling studies of Barmack and Yakhnitsa (2008) and Simpson et al. (2005). They discharge at highly regular firing rates and hence show narrow ISI histograms, with a wide range of possible median values. We have indeed encountered cells in the granular layer corresponding to this description (Fig. 3) and have excluded them from our GC population, although recorded spike trains with similar properties have also been attributed to Golgi units after juxtacellular labeling (Holtzman et al., 2006). We also found that the presumed UBCs we recorded have action potential durations significantly shorter than GCs (Fig. 3), which would be consistent with their comparatively smaller somata sizes (Barmack and Yakhnitsa, 2008). Unfortunately, we cannot exclude the possibility that some Lugaro cells were erroneously included in our GC group, simply because, to our knowledge, Lugaro cells have never been physiologically characterized ; only in slice preparations of the rat cerebellum (Dieudonn\u00e9 and Dumoulin, 2000). It should however be noted that GCs largely outnumber the Lugaro cells in the granular layer [the ratio of Golgi to Lugaro cells is \u223c67/15 in the mouse cerebellum according to Simat et al. (2007)]. Finally, unlike previously reported (Edgley and Lidierth, 1987), we did not find that PC action potentials were shorter than those of GCs (Fig. 3) were. The GC action potential durations were, however, more variable, which would be in agreement with their morphological heterogeneity (Geurts et al., 2003).As a final point, it is important to state that we did not confirm the identity of Golgi cells or mossy fiber terminals morphologically, nor did we perform electrolytic lesions at recording sites. Our identification therefore remains putative.We recorded eye saccade responses of 177 putative GCs and 103 putative MFs. Both types of units exhibited a variety of response patterns including burst only [69% for MFs (Fig. 4); 65% for GCs (Fig. 4)] and pause only [14% for MFs (Fig. 4); 25% for GCs (Fig. 4)], while other cells/fibers exhibited a burst-followed-by-a-pause or pause-followed-by-a-burst pattern [17% for MFs (Fig. 4); 10% for GCs (Fig. 4,)]. Both saccade-related (phasic) and position-related (tonic) increases (bursts) and decreases (pauses) in firing rate levels were observed., , Diversity of response patterns recorded from six exemplary mossy fibers () and Golgi cells (). In each panel, the upper trace represents horizontal () and vertical () eye movements, the middle trace shows the spike raster plot, and the lower trace is the estimated mean spike density function for all trials. All trials are aligned on saccade onset represented by the thin vertical line.High unit-to-unit variability in start timings of the bursting responses (as detected by a Poisson spike train analysis; see Materials and Methods) relative to saccade onset [median (lower quartile, upper quartile): \u221214 (\u221264, 10) ms,  = 87 for MFs; \u221211 (\u221258, 7) ms,  = 126 for GCs] and end timings relative to saccade end [median (lower quartile, upper quartile): 10 (\u221227, 74) ms,  = 87 for MFs; 24 (\u221220, 81) ms,  = 126 for GCs], as well as highly variable durations of the related bursts [median (lower quartile, upper quartile): 94 (56, 145) ms,  = 87 for MFs; 104 (67, 155) ms,  = 126 for GCs] and pauses (subjectively evaluated), was observed without any obvious relationship to their classification as GCs or MFs. Where the GCs strikingly differed from MFs however, was in the peak frequency of the burst responses. GCs only rarely displayed saccade-evoked bursts >100 spk/s [median (lower quartile, upper quartile): 40.6 (32.8, 53.45) spk/s,  = 126], whereas MFs exhibited very strong bursts of activity often in the range of 100\u2013200 spikes/s [median (lower quartile, upper quartile): 67.9 (49.2, 97.7) spikes/s,  = 87]. Further qualitative differences could be observed between the responses of MFs and GCs, namely in the pause and position-related burst patterns. The position-related bursts recorded from GCs had wavering firing rate levels and often decreased to baseline during prolonged eccentric fixation. Although most position-related responses of MFs approximately resembled those of GCs, many also showed distinct constant tonic levels maintained during prolonged peripheral fixation. These were often accompanied by phasic components and resemble the discharge of motor units in the abducens nucleus (Fig. 4). Whereas the pause responses of GCs could either be very precise and short (Fig. 4) or long and position-related (Fig. 4), those of MFs all persisted for longer durations, often throughout peripheral fixation (Fig. 4).The identified GCs and MFs were tested for directional selectivity while the monkeys executed saccades in eight different directions in the frontoparallel plane (see the directional selectivity paradigm in Materials and Methods). For each tested unit, the perisaccadic activity (see Materials and Methods) was computed on a trial by trial basis and mean values were obtained for each of the eight directions of movement. The maximum (or minimum for pausing units) mean value was compared with the means of the other seven directions; when the difference was not statistically significant in more than four neighboring directions (meaning that directions >90\u00b0 apart have similar activities), the unit was labeled as not directionally selective (see Fig. 6). If, on the contrary, the unit showed directional selectivity, the preferred direction was evaluated as the angular value at which a Gaussian fit to the data points reached its peak.From the 63 MFs (26 from monkey A and 37 from monkey N) tested using this paradigm, most (47, i.e., 74.6%) showed a clear directional tuning as illustrated by two typical examples in Figure 5,. Furthermore, the directionally selective MFs differed in the amount of suppression of their discharge relative to baseline for the direction opposite to the preferred one; some held their activity close to baseline (Fig. 5), while others ceased firing (Fig. 5). The 111 GCs (52 from monkey A and 59 from monkey N) tested for directional selectivity were found to exhibit a remarkably different behavior than the MFs. A minority of GCs (45, i.e., 40.5%) were directionally selective while the majority showed no clear directional preference as depicted in two typical examples in Figure 5,. Moreover, as many as 35 GCs (31.6%) showed no significant difference in their perisaccadic activity, when compared with the \u201coptimal\u201d direction, for all other seven neighboring directions (Fig. 6), while this was true in the case of only eight MFs (12.7%)., Directional tuning properties of two exemplary mossy fibers (, ) and Golgi cells (, ). In each figure, the top central panel shows the directional tuning of the perisaccadic activity (in red) and activity during fixation (in blue) to the eight directions of movement. The bottom central panel shows a Gaussian fit to the normalized perisaccadic activity ratio points (see Materials and Methods) for the eight directions, and the inset depicts the preferred direction of movement of the cell (angle corresponding to the peak of the Gaussian fit), with the shaded area corresponding to the SD of the Gaussian curve. Each exterior panel is aligned with one of the eight movement directions and shows the raster plot and the mean spike density for that direction. All trials are aligned on saccade onset represented by the thin vertical line. The absence of a curve fit in  indicates that a Gaussian function was inappropriate to describe the data.Directional selectivity properties of GC and MF. , Histogram showing the percentage of cells/fibers considered to be directionally selective.

Insets, The SD (shaded area) around the preferred direction of the average cell/fiber. , Circular plots showing the preferred directions of 97 Golgi cells and 61 mossy fibers (only units with appropriate Gaussian fits to the directional data points were included, see Materials and Methods), together with histograms in which these directions were binned into octants. The arrows and dotted lines designate movement directions.To ascertain a categorical description of the directional selectivity behavior of the MF and GC populations, it was first of interest to establish to what extent the eight different directions of movement tested were represented in the perisaccadic discharge of the GCs and MFs respectively. To address this question, circular data of preferred directions of individual units was compiled (Fig. 6; see figure legend for details). Both Rao's spacing test and Rayleigh's uniformity test (both evaluate the probability of the null hypothesis that circular data are uniformly distributed along the 360\u00b0 range) yielded lower  values for MFs (Rao:  = 0.05, Rayleigh:  = 0.07) than for GCs (Rao:  = 0.17, Rayleigh:  = 0.81). The circular histograms provided in Figure 6 furthermore show that for both GCs and MFs, the two bins with maximum number of counts correspond to the two horizontal directions. These horizontal-preferring units constitute 51% of our MF sample but only 36% of our GC sample (25% would be expected for uniformly distributed data). It is therefore apparent that the octants corresponding to the other six nonhorizontal directions contain a proportionately larger number of counts for GCs than for MFs. Together, these findings suggest that MFs in the OMV are biased toward encoding horizontal movements, confirming previous findings of Ohtsuka and Noda (1992), but, in the same cortical area, all directions of movement seem to be more equally represented in the population response of GCs.To directly compare the amount of direction selectivity of the two groups of units, we calculated the average normalized perisaccadic discharge of the two groups. For this purpose, the perisaccadic activity means of all individual cells/fibers were normalized in a way to always have the same direction (0\u00b0) as the preferred one (i.e., the tuning data were rotated so as the maximal perisaccadic activity value is pointing in the 0\u00b0 direction). Least squares Gaussian fits to the population averages of such normalized data points (Fig. 6) (see Materials and Methods for details) reveal that the MFs have a much narrower tuning than the GCs [variance parameter of the Gaussian curve with 95% confidence bounds: 64.35\u00b0 (49.95\u00b0, 78.75\u00b0) for MFs and 208.35\u00b0 (144.45\u00b0, 272.7\u00b0) for GCs]. Because the 95% confidence bounds on the variance estimates do not overlap for the two groups, the difference in direction tuning affinity is judged to be statistically significant.After having established the directional preference of the recorded GCs and MFs, the monkeys executed saccades toward targets at eight different eccentricities in the preferred direction of the cell/fiber (see amplitude tuning paradigm in Materials and Methods). Because saccades toward increasing target eccentricities are associated with increasing saccade amplitude, velocity and duration, this paradigm allows us to establish if and how movement metrics are encoded by the activity of the recorded cells/fibers.We first examined the GCs/MFs with burst responses using a Poisson spike train analysis (Hanes et al. 1995). Bursts were detected with this method in 105 (60 from monkey A and 45 from monkey N) and 86 (55 from monkey A and 31 from monkey N) of the recorded GCs and MFs, respectively, in the amplitude tuning paradigm. The peak discharge rate of the detected bursts was plotted as a function of increasing saccade amplitude for all the individual cells/fibers. Among the highly diverse tuning profiles that could be observed for all of the 105 GCs, two leading trends stand out and are illustrated by typical examples in Figure 7. As shown in these figures, the peak burst discharge of most GCs either increased weakly or not at all with increasing saccade amplitude (Fig. 7), or showed clear preference for intermediate saccade sizes (Fig. 7). Also, the bursts of individual MFs could be characterized by two predominant tuning profiles that were most often observed. However, unlike the GCs, burst peaks of many MFs correlated positively and distinctly with saccade size (Fig. 7), while others reached their maximum at intermediate amplitudes (Fig. 7). To obtain a statistical description of the GC and MF mean population burst responses, increasing saccade amplitudes were divided into bins and all of the detected bursts were averaged for each bin (see Materials and Methods for details), regardless of what the preferred direction of the cell/fiber was. The resulting population data (Fig. 8,) reveal that the MF peak burst discharge increases linearly with increasing amplitude (linear fit: 2 = 0.92,  < 10\u22124), whereas the relationship between saccade sizes and burst maxima for the GCs is best described with a comparatively flat inverse parabola (quadratic fit: 2 = 0.9,  = 0.0003;  test for quadratic vs linear fits:  = 18.13, 1 = 1, 2 = 8,  = 0.0028)., Amplitude tuning characteristics of two exemplary Golgi cells (, ) and mossy fibers (, ). In each figure, the top panels each show the spike raster plot and the mean spike density for the indicated saccade amplitude (5\u00b0, 10\u00b0, 15\u00b0 or 20\u00b0). All trials are aligned on saccade onset (vertical line). The bottom panels shows the peak discharge data points as a function of saccade amplitude and a corresponding least squares fit of a linear or Gaussian function.Amplitude tuning properties of the average peak discharge of Golgi cell and mossy fiber bursting units (, ) and timing properties of the mossy fiber and Golgi cell population responses. , Mean burst peak discharge as a function of saccade amplitude calculated for 105 Golgi cells.

To this end we ordered all the recorded saccades and the associated cell/fiber spike trains by increasing saccade duration, divided the record into equally sized bins, and computed the average spike activity for each bin (see Materials and Methods for details). In this manner, the mean population activity of 177 GCs (112 from monkey A and 65 from monkey N) (Fig. 8) and 103 MFs (66 from monkey A and 37 from monkey N) (Fig. 8), tested with the amplitude tuning paradigm regardless of their response patterns and preferred directions, could be evaluated. The onset of the MF population response relative to saccade onset (mean \u00b1 SD: \u221283.71 \u00b1 21.17 ms) was found to precede that of the GC population (mean \u00b1 SD: \u221274 \u00b1 15.7 ms) in a statistically significant manner ( test:  = 0.017). Both population bursts thereafter persisted beyond the end of the saccadic eye movement, but differed greatly in the timing properties of their cessation. On the one hand, the ending of the MF response correlated linearly with increasing saccade duration (linear fit: 2 = 0.89,  < 10\u22129) and on the other, the end of the GC population burst was best fitted with an inverse parabola as a function of saccade duration (quadratic fit: 2 = 0.86,  < 10\u22127;  test for quadratic vs linear fits:  = 31.18, v1 = 1, v2 = 19,  < 10\u22124). Moreover, the MF population response lasted far beyond that of the GCs [response end relative to saccade end, median (lower quartile, upper quartile): 138 (80, 231) ms, for MFs; 65 (54, 79.5) ms, for GCs], suspected to be caused by the strong position-related response patterns characterizing some of these units (Fig. 4).Overall, 40 GCs could be kept isolated long enough to be tested during saccadic adaptation in the preferred direction of the cell/fiber [19 cells (13 from monkey A and 6 from monkey N) for inward and 21 cells (15 from monkey A and 6 from monkey N) for outward adaptation]. This form of short-term learning (see saccadic adaptation paradigm in Materials and Methods) allowed us to examine how GCs behave, compared with what is already known about the plasticity of PCs, during a recalibration of the saccadic system.On an individual cell basis, we never observed obvious changes in the firing profiles of the recorded neurons. Despite progressively increasing or decreasing saccade amplitudes associated with a recalibrated saccadic command, individual GCs generally maintained their initial pattern of activity throughout the course of adaptation (Figs. 9, 10). Furthermore, the population mean activity was computed for the GCs tested for inward (Fig. 9) and outward (Fig. 10) adaptation. It was of interest to see whether and how peak activity, onset latency, and end latency estimates of the population average changed with increasing/decreasing saccade amplitude gains (see figure legends and Materials and Methods for details). Peak activity and onset latency showed no significant linear changes (linear fits: 2 = 0.19,  = 0.053 and 2 = 0.06,  = 0.28, respectively) during the course of inward adaptation, whereas the end latency of the burst showed a marginally significant decrease (linear fit: 2 = 0.26,  = 0.02). In the case of outward adaptation, the onset latency of the population burst exhibited a barely significant increase (linear fit: 2 = 0.23,  = 0.032), and peak discharge and end latency remain unchanged (linear fits: 2 = 0.03,  = 0.48 and 2 = 0.04,  = 0.38, respectively), while the amplitude of saccades increased., Spiking activity of three exemplary Golgi cells during the course of inward adaptation.

The panels are as in Figure 9.Unfortunately, we could not test the MFs during the adaptation paradigms, mainly because the recording stability of MFs was often poor, making it difficult to keep their action potentials well isolated for longer times.Previous recordings from the OMV and the flocculus during eye movements in monkeys are in accordance with our results about the different patterns of activity recorded from MFs (Kase et al., 1980; Miles et al., 1980; Ohtsuka and Noda, 1992). Similarly, recordings from monkeys in the intermediate cerebellar cortex during forelimb manipulations (van Kan et al., 1993) describe various combinations of tonic and phasic discharges of MFs. In the case of the OMV, the MF afferents have been shown to arise mainly in the pontine nuclei, the nucleus reticularis tegmentis pontis (NRTP), and the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF), suggesting that the cerebellum is provided by both cortical and subcortical information about visually guided eye movements (Thielert and Thier, 1993). Based on their recordings, Ohtsuka and Noda (1992) have, however, concluded that the MFs destined for the OMV are restricted to the PPRF and superior colliculus (via NRTP), because the end of their MF bursting responses always precluded the completion of the saccade. Our own data show a much higher variability of MF burst timings, and such heterogeneity indeed conforms to the fact that the MF input to the cerebellum originates from various movement-related sources in the brainstem.The cell-to-cell variability of movement-related discharges in GCs was also observed for various eye and head movements (Miles et al., 1980) and forelimb manipulations (van Kan et al., 1993) in the monkey, as well as during cat locomotion (Edgley and Lidierth, 1987). This was vexingly not the case for electrical and somatosensory stimuli of vibrissal pads and limbs in rats (Vos et al., 1999b; Holtzman et al., 2006), in which the evoked GC responses were more stereotypical. This variability observed in GCs could simply reflect excitations, direct or indirect, from the heterogeneous MFs. However, the Golgi group included substantially more pause units, often phasic, which we never observed in MFs. The additional modulation of GCs by inhibitory interneurons seems pertinent in this context. The axonal plexus of individual GCs are known to branch within generally non-overlapping parasagittal planes (Barmack and Yakhnitsa, 2008). Combined with the heterogeneity of their discharge patterns, this suggests, as previously speculated by Edgley and Lidierth (1987), that subpopulations of thousands of GrCs organized in sagittal zones are under different patterns of inhibitory control.van Kan et al. (1993) reported that most MFs responded reciprocally to extension and flexion movements and exhibited strong device specificity (showed preference for shoulder, elbow, wrist, or finger manipulation), whereas GCs fired identically for both flexion and extension, and lacked device specificity. Similarly, Edgley and Lidierth (1987) stated that the majority of GCs were responsive to stimuli of both forelimbs of the cat, and the eye saccade-related responses of MFs recorded in the flocculus (Miles et al., 1980) or the OMV (Kase et al., 1980; Ohtsuka and Noda, 1992) generally showed strong directional preference. Finally, electrical and tactile stimuli of the rat face or limbs (Vos et al., 1999b; Holtzman et al., 2006) revealed that responses in GCs could be elicited from widespread areas. All these findings are in accordance with our own results about the disparity of directional selectivity between MF and GC populations (Fig. 5, 6).The strong directional selectivity of MFs entails that restricted groups of GrCs [400\u2013600 per MF according to Ito (2006)] are excited preferentially for movements in a particular direction. The broad directional tuning of GCs then suggests that these neurons are well suited to individually inhibit large groups [thousands according to H\u00e1mori and Szent\u00e1gothai (1966)] of GrCs regardless of movement direction. In principle, the excitation of a GC by numerous parallel fibers originating from GrCs, each tuned to a particular direction, could account for the broad directional field of that neuron. However, the efficacy of the parallel fiber input to GCs has been demonstrated to be too weak to modulate their firing (Dieudonne, 1998), leading to assertions that the activity of GCs is determined mainly by direct MF excitation. Because MFs fire preferentially for eye saccades in a single direction, the absence of directional preference in GCs would require a substantial convergence of direct MF excitatory inputs onto single neurons. Still, compared with the vast majority of GC dendrites that ascend toward the molecular layer, only few are thought to branch within the granule layer (Pellionisz and Szent\u00e1gothai, 1973). This observation would alternatively lend credit to the assumption that GCs are modulated by a climbing fiber-dependent signal and other cerebellar interneurons (Barmack and Yakhnitsa, 2008). If the GC modulation were, however, climbing fiber-dependent, it would be expected to show changes during saccadic adaptation, which we found not to be the case.The population activity of MFs showed distinct linear relationships with saccade metrics (Fig. 8,). Therefore, the abundance of information carried by MFs to the cerebellum is movement specific. Ohtsuka and Noda (1992) reported tuning curves to saccade amplitude of MFs similar to ours, and van Kan et al. (1993) further confirmed that several properties of MF firing correlated with joint angle, movement velocity, and duration. Conversely, the GC population did not reflect any features specific to the metrics or timing of eye saccades (Fig. 8,). The study by Edgley and Lidierth (1987) is the only other one to our knowledge to examine the specificity of GCs to movement metrics. In line with our own results, they reported that different speeds of locomotion and platform inclination angles resulted in unaltered timing patterns and discharge rates of most GCs. Therefore, the observation that MFs convey movement-specific data to the cerebellum and that GCs are oblivious to this information, suggests that these neurons are not well suited to perform gain control over PC discharge. In contradiction with the gain control theory, our results suggest that larger and/or longer eye saccades will result in a higher/longer excitation of GrCs by MFs, but the same GrCs will not receive a proportionately larger inhibition from GCs that would be needed to limit the amount of MF transmission to PCs.The population response of PCs has been shown to be characterized by an intriguingly precise reflection of saccade timing (Thier et al., 2000), while our present results show that GCs fail to provide any alike information. It is clear that any influence GCs might have on PCs via their inhibition of GrCs cannot be responsible for this feature of the PC population. Our other finding is that MFs, the input to the cerebellar cortex, encode an abundance of movement-specific information, which contrasts the much more restricted information found on the output side at the level of PCs. Unlike PCs, the MF population response does not end simultaneously with saccade end but lasts much beyond (Fig. 8), and furthermore, bursting MFs fire on average more for larger saccades (Fig. 8), which is not characteristic of PCs (Thier et al., 2000). A confinement of the input information seems thus to be necessary on its pathway toward the PC layer, in which the inhibitory GCs, although anatomically in an ideal position, are hardly involved. More generally, if one assumes that the firing properties of a major interneuron are indicative of the saccade-related properties of the granular layer at large, than the saccade-related timing of the PC population is not a mere reflection of a previous processing in the granular layer of the movement-specific MF input. Alternatively, climbing fibers and molecular layer interneurons may be more important in modulating this unique activity of PCs, which might also be an emerging property of the circuitry rather than reflective of input.Another distinctive feature of GCs is that they fail to exhibit the kind of plasticity observed in PC simple spikes (Catz et al., 2008) during saccadic adaptation. Our results do not suggest any strong correlation between changes in GC firing and changes in the adapting amplitude of saccades (Fig. 9, 10). Therefore, the PC simple spike activity modulation of saccade dynamics during adaptation [see the study by Catz et al. (2008) for details] seems not to be caused by a previous processing of the MF input in the granular layer, but is instead a consequence of adjusting the complex spike activity (Catz et al., 2005). Our results thus show that behaviorally relevant cerebellar plasticity emerges only at the level of PCs, where the climbing fiber input seems to play the major role.This work was supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft Sonderforschungsbereich 550 A7.Thank you for sharing this Journal of Neuroscience article.NOTE: We request your email address only to inform the recipient that it was you who recommended this article, and that it is not junk mail.

We describe a homozygous, missense, single nucleotide (G to C) mutation in the Cav3.2 T-type Ca2+ channel gene () in the genetic absence epilepsy rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) model of IGE. The GAERS Cav3.2 mutation () produces an arginine to proline (R1584P) substitution in exon 24 of , encoding a portion of the III\u2013IV linker region in Cav3.2.  segregates codominantly with the number of seizures and time in seizure activity in progeny of an F1 intercross. We have further identified two major thalamic  splice variants, either with or without exon 25.  introduced into the splice variants acts \u201cepistatically,\u201d requiring the presence of exon 25 to produce significantly faster recovery from channel inactivation and greater charge transference during high-frequency bursts. This gain-of-function mutation, the first reported in the GAERS polygenic animal model, has a novel mechanism of action, being dependent on exonic splicing for its functional consequences to be expressed.The idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGEs) are a common group of diseases with a strong hereditary component. Despite a small number of genes explaining the disease in rare families, the genetic causes of the majority of the IGEs remain undetermined and are generally believed to be polygenic. Absence seizures, which form part of the IGE spectrum, are nonconvulsive generalized seizures resulting in a brief impairment of consciousness (Mattson, 2003). The genetic absence epilepsy rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) are a well validated genetic rat model of absence epilepsy (Marescaux et al., 1984) that exhibit spontaneous spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) on a normal electroencephalogram (EEG) background, closely resembling the human condition. Cross-breeding (Marescaux et al., 1992) and qualitative trait linkage analysis (Rudolf et al., 2004) studies indicate that the epilepsy phenotype in GAERS is polygenically determined. However, despite two decades of study, the nature of the genetic determinants underlying the epileptic phenotype of GAERS has not been identified previously.The thalamocortical network is critically involved in the propagation of SWDs in both human absence epilepsy and many animal models (Crunelli and Leresche, 2002). Extensive investigation has revealed that neuronal low-voltage-activated (T-type) Ca2+ channels underlie burst firing and oscillatory behavior in this network as a result of their ability to generate Ca2+ spikes near resting membrane potential (Llinas and Yarom, 1981; Carbone and Lux, 1984; Huguenard and Prince, 1992; Perez-Reyes, 2003). Three lines of evidence specifically implicate the T-type Ca2+ channel with absence epilepsy. First, Cav3.2 mRNA expression (Talley et al., 2000) and T-type Ca2+ currents (Tsakiridou et al., 1995) have been found to be elevated in the reticular nucleus of the thalamus (nRT) of GAERS. Second, elevated thalamic T-type currents precede the onset of absence seizures in a SNAP-25-deficient mouse model (Zhang et al., 2004). Third, mutations in the human  have been found in patients with childhood absence epilepsy and juvenile absence epilepsy (Chen et al., 2003; Liang et al., 2006, 2007; Heron et al., 2007) with exogenous expression of mutant human Cav3.2 channels revealing a variety of biophysical changes (Khosravani et al., 2004, 2005; Vitko et al., 2005, 2007; Peloquin et al., 2006).Here we report the first mutation with functional effects in a polygenic animal model of absence epilepsy. The GAERS Cav3.2 mutation () is situated in exon 24 of  in a region encoding a portion of the domain III\u2013IV linker. Electrophysiological investigation revealed that  increases the rate of recovery from channel inactivation, producing a predicted gain-of-function phenotype. The functional effects of  are dependent on alternative splicing of exon 25, being manifested in the splice variant with this exon [Cav3.2 (+25)]. These results provide unique insight into the genetic cause of absence seizures in GAERS as well as provide new knowledge regarding the structural\u2013functional relationship for Cav3.2 T-type Ca2+ channels. Of particular importance is the demonstration of the principle that genetic mutations may have functional effects only in certain splice variants of ion channels (Adams et al., 2007).The double cross matings required for this study were produced in two stages. First, GAERS rats (homozygous or \u2212/\u2212 for the Cav3.2  mutation) were crossed with nonepileptic control (NEC) rats (null or +/+ for the  mutation) to produce an F1 generation, all of which should be heterozygous for the mutation. Then, two F1 (+/\u2212) generation rats were mated to produce an F2 generation. On average, 25% of the F2 progeny would be expected to be homozygous for the mutation, 50% heterozygous for the mutation, and 25% null or not carrying the mutation at all.The study was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research/Department of Surgery, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, The University of Melbourne and conformed to National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines for the ethical use of animals in scientific research. All surgeries were performed under deep general anesthetic, with each rat receiving an intraperitoneal injection (5 ml/kg) of anesthetic solution containing ketamine (75 mg/kg; Ketavet 100; Parnell Laboratories) and xylazine (10 mg/kg; Xylazil-20; Troy Laboratories) in 0.9% sodium chloride. Once anesthetized, a single midline incision was made on the scalp, from just posterior to the eyes to between the ears. Six holes were drilled through the skull but not penetrating the dura, one on each side anterior to the bregma and two on each side posterior to the bregma. A recording electrode was screwed into each hole. Each recording electrode comprised a 1.3 mm \u201cmale\u201d gold connector (Farnell Components) soldered onto a nickel alloy jeweler screw. The recording electrodes were fixed in position by applying Vertex dental cement around the electrodes and over the skull. The incision was then sutured (Dysilk 3/0). Immediately after surgery, each rat received an intraperitoneal injection of 1 ml/kg analgesic solution containing intraperitoneal carprofen analgesic (5 mg/kg; Rimadyl; Pfizer Australia) in 0.9% sodium chloride. Polyvisc was again applied to the eyes.Seven days after surgery, all rats underwent four 90 min EEG recordings over weeks 17 and 18 (two recordings per week). The rats were connected to an EEG board, and their EEG trace was recorded using Compumedics EEG acquisition software. Recordings lasted 90 min after an initial 15 min habituation period. Recordings alternately took place in the morning or afternoon; each rat had two morning and two afternoon recordings. The animals were able to move freely around their cage and were constantly monitored by an investigator to ensure that they did not fall asleep using gentle finger taps on the side of the cage as necessary. Rats were allowed at least 2 d rest between consecutive recordings. All rats were observed during the recording to confirm their seizure status. Seizure expression for the 90 min after injection EEG recording was quantified by visual inspection of the EEG recordings, blinded to the animal's genotype. Standard criteria described for adult GAERS were used to classify the seizures, i.e., an SWD burst of amplitude of more than three times baseline, a frequency of 7\u201312 Hz, and duration of longer than 0.5 s (Marescaux et al., 1992; Liu et al., 2006). The start and end of each seizure was determined by manually marking the beginning and end of each SWD on the EEG. From this, the total percentage time spent in seizure over the 90 min postinjection EEG recording was determined, the primary endpoint for comparison of the treatment effect on seizure expression.Genomic DNA was extracted from tail tips using the Promega Wizard Genomic DNA extraction kit, and genotyping PCR was performed using primers designed to amplify exon 24 (193 bp). Each 20 \u03bcl of PCR reaction contained the following: 1\u00d7 DNA polymerase buffer, 2.5 U of DNA polymerase, 250 \u03bcm dNTPs, 500 nm forward and reverse primers, and 25 ng of genomic DNA (for primer sequences, see supplemental Table 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). To confirm the correct size band, 5 \u03bcl of PCR reactions were run on a 2% agarose gel with molecular weight markers, and gels were stained with GelRed DNA stain (Jomar) and visualized under UV light. PCR reactions were cleaned up using the Promega PCR cleanup kit, and purified PCR products were sent to the Australian Genome Research Facility (Brisbane, Australia) for sequencing (for primer sequences, see supplemental Table 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Sequence analysis was done using Sequence Scanner version 1.0 (Applied Biosystems).Total RNA was extracted from adult Wistar rat thalamus using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. One microgram total RNA was initially treated with DNase to avoid genomic DNA contamination during reverse transcription using the Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) enzyme. A total of 20 \u03bcl of reaction volume was prepared containing DNase-treated total RNA, first strand buffer (1\u00d7), DTT (10 \u03bcm), oligo-dT (0.5 \u03bcg/L), dNTP mix (500 \u03bcm), RNAseOUT (40 U), and reverse transcriptase (200 U). Reaction mixture was incubated at 42\u00b0C for 50 min and inactivated by heating to 70\u00b0C for 15 min. Finally, RNase H (2 U) was added to the mixture and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 20 min to remove the RNA complementary to the cDNA.Initially, splice variant exon scanning was performed on rat thalamic RNA to identify the existence of expressed Cav3.2 isoforms. Overlapping primer sets were designed to amplify between two and five exons. PCR products were sequenced and compared with genomic sequence for the presence of splice sites. Subsequently, full-length Cav3.2 cDNA libraries were made from thalamic total RNA (2 \u03bcg) using Cav3.2-specific forward (5\u2032-GATAAGCTTATGACCGAGGGCACG-3\u2032) and reverse (5\u2032-CGCTCTAGACTACACAGGCTCATC-3\u2032) primers. The cDNA products were subcloned into the pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega), and a total of 76 full-length Cav3.2 cDNAs were subject to complete DNA sequencing. Full-length Cav3.2 with or without exon 25 alternative splice variants were moved from pGEM T-Easy to pCDNA3.1 zeo(+) (Invitrogen) using the restriction enzymes dIII and I (introduced at beginning and end, respectively, of the Cav3.2 cDNAs). The DNA sequence of the full-length Cav3.2 clones were determined using automated DNA sequencing, and sequences were aligned to available published genomic Cav3.2 sequences. The  was introduced into the +/\u2212 exon 25 Cav3.2 clones using the Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) procedure (Stratagene) with the GAERS\u2013sdm1 (5\u2032-AGGAGGCTCGGCGCCGGAGGAGAAACGGCT-3\u2032) and GAERS\u2013sdm2 (5\u2032-AGCCGTTTCTCCTCCGGCGCCGAGCCTCCT-3\u2032) primers. Once generated, the GAERS mutation +/\u2212 exon 25 was removed as an 872 bp RV\u2013BI fragment and cloned back into a nonmutagenized Cav3.2 plasmid background to remove nonspecific mutations introduced during SDM. Finally, the \u00b1 exon 25 GAERS clones were then fully resequenced to confirm that no other mutation had been introduced.Adult chronically epileptic (18\u201321 weeks) GAERS and age-matched NEC rats were culled by a lethal dose of pentobarbital (Lethabarb) anesthetic (Virbac), followed by rapid extraction of the brain. The thalamic brain region was rapidly dissected and stored in RNALater (Applied Biosystems) and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C.RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN) and treated with DNase I (QIAGEN) to remove any contaminating genomic DNA and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Spectrophotometric readings were taken with the NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies) to determine RNA concentration and purity. For each sample, 2 \u03bcg of total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit from Applied Biosystems. Real-time-PCR reaction was performed using Applied Biosystems reagents and TaqMan probes to the respective gene targets on an Applied Biosystems AB 7500 system. Primer mixes used for detection of exon 25 splice variants were as follows: + exon 25 (H-Cav3.2-plus25 forward, GCGCAGGAGCACTTTCC; H-Cav3.2-plus25 reverse, GAGTGTGTGAATAGTCTGCGTAGTA; H-Cav3.2-plus25-Probe, CCAACCCAGAGGCCCAG); \u2212 exon 25 (H-Cav3.2-minus25 forward, CGCCGGGAGGAGAAACG; H-Cav3.2-minus25 reverse, GAGTGTGTGAATAGTCTGCGTAGTA; H-Cav3.2-minus25-Probe, CTGGGCCTTCCTGCGCC). Titration curves to calculate copy number parameters for each of the + and \u2212 exon 25 primer sets were produced using splice-variant-specific full-length cDNA plasmid clones. A rat actin B (ActB) primer set (Applied Biosystems AB 4352340E) was run in parallel with the + and \u2212 exon 25 probes in all samples as a control for total cDNA input to allow comparison. Copy numbers for each splice variant in each sample were then calculated and scaled, using relative ActB amounts, before being compared. Target and control probe reactions were run in triplicate and averaged for each sample.Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 50 U/ml penicillin, and 50 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transiently transfected with Cav3.2 or Cav3.2  (0.6 \u03bcg of cDNA per 35 mm2 dish, plus 0.1 \u03bcg per dish of GFP marker) in pcDNA3.1zeo(+) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 for 24\u201348 h before recording.Ca2+ currents were recorded using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique with the following two solutions (in mm): internal: 120 Cs-methanesulphonate, 11 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2 MgCl2, 5 MgATP, and 0.3 NaGTP, pH 7.2; external: 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 40 tetraethylammonium-Cl, 92 CsCl, and 10 glucose, pH 7.4. Fire-polished patch pipettes (borosilicate glass) had typical resistances of 3\u20135 M\u03a9 when containing internal solution. The recording chamber was grounded with an Ag/AgCl pellet. Whole-cell currents were recorded at room temperature using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Data were acquired with pClamp software package version 9 (Molecular Devices). Series resistance (s) was compensated by 65\u201375%, and seals with s values >20 M\u03a9 or cells with peak current <100 pA were discarded. Data analysis was performed using Clampfit 9 (Molecular Devices) and software Origin version 7.5 (Microcal Software). Data followed a normal distribution, and statistical significance was calculated using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's  test considering a  value <0.05 as significant. Data were plotted as mean \u00b1 SE values.The current\u2013voltage () relationship was obtained by depolarizing the membrane with 150 ms pulses from a holding potential of \u2212110 mV (currents sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz). Test pulses from \u221290 to +10 mV were applied at 5 mV steps. Peak amplitude of Ca2+ currents was plotted against test pulse potential, and  curves were fitted using a modified Boltzmann equation:  = (max * (m \u2212 r))/(1 + exp((m \u2212 50)/)), where max is the maximum value of membrane conductance, m is the test potential, r is the extrapolated reversal potential, 50 is the half-activation potential, and  (slope constant:  = /\u03b4, where  is gas constant,  is absolute temperature,  is valence of conducting ion, \u03b4 is electrical distance across the membrane, and  is Faraday's constant) reflects the voltage sensitivity. Activation curves were obtained by calculating conductance from the  curves and plotting the normalized conductance as a function of the membrane potential. The data were fitted with the following Boltzmann equation: /max = 2 + (1 \u2212 2)/(1 + exp((m \u2212 50)/)), where 1 is minimum normalized conductance, 2 is maximum normalized conductance, m is the test potential, 50 is the half-activation potential, and  value is the slope of the activation curve (slope constant).Steady-state inactivation was studied using 90 ms test pulses at \u221230 mV applied after 2 s conditioning prepulses ranging from \u2212120 to \u221210 mV (currents sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz). The current magnitude obtained during each test pulse was normalized to the maximum at \u2212120 mV and plotted as a function of the prepulse potential. The data were fitted with the following Boltzmann equation: /max = 2 + (1 \u2212 2)/(1 + exp((m \u2212 50)/)), where 1 is minimum normalized current, 2 is the maximum normalized current, m is the test potential, 50 is the half-inactivation potential, and  reflects the slope of the inactivation curve (slope constant). The time course for activation (\u03c4act) and inactivation (\u03c4inact) were analyzed by fitting current recordings obtained from the  protocol with a single-exponential standard equation:  =  \u2212 /\u03c4, where  is the amplitude of the current, and \u03c4 is the time constant.Recovery from inactivation was studied using a double-pulse protocol at a holding potential of \u2212110 mV (currents sampled at 2 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz) to ensure complete deinactivation of Cav3.2 channels. The cell membrane was depolarized for 400 ms to \u221230 mV (prepulse) to ensure complete channel inactivation and then to \u221230 mV for 50 ms (test pulse) after an increasing time period (interpulse interval) between 5 ms and 5 s. The peak current from the test pulse was plotted as a ratio of maximum prepulse current versus interpulse interval. The data were fitted with a double-exponential function: /max = 1 * exp(\u2212/\u03c41) + 2 * exp(\u2212/\u03c42), where 1 and 2 are the amplitude for the fast and slow components of the exponential, and \u03c41 and \u03c42 are the time constants for the fast and slow components, respectively.Cav3.2 activity during high-frequency burst depolarization was studied using a burst square pulse protocol at a holding potential of \u221270 mV (currents sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 5 kHz). The membrane was depolarized for 4 ms to \u221220 mV at a frequency of 125 Hz for 80 ms to produce a high-frequency burst. Burst depolarizations were performed at a frequency of 5 Hz for 1 s. The data were analyzed by taking the integral of each burst individually giving a measurement of charge transference () carried by Ca2+ through Cav3.2. Charge transference was then divided by the peak current on the first pulse of the first burst to account for variation in current magnitude between cells to yield a charge transference factor (/pA).The entire coding region (7098 bp) of  was sequenced in both GAERS ( = 3) and NEC ( = 3) rats, and we identified a single-nucleotide mutation in GAERS compared with NEC and  strains (Table 1). At base pair 4751 in exon 24, NEC rats and  both possess a guanine (G), whereas GAERS possess a cytosine (C). The base change results in an amino acid change from an arginine (CGG) to a proline (CCG) at position 1584 (R1584P) located within the domain III\u2013IV linker region of the channel. This region of the gene is highly conserved across species and across other T-type Ca2+ channels, suggesting a critical functional role. Arginine is a basic amino acid with a long side chain, whereas proline is a cyclic amino acid lacking a hydrogen at the amino end and is unable to form hydrogen bonds and thus can disrupt protein structure. Exon 24, the location of the , was then sequenced in another 15 NEC and 22 GAERS, revealing that all NEC rats were null for the  and all GAERS had two copies of the  We screened additional rat strains, i.e., Sprague Dawley, Wistar\u2013Kyoto, spontaneously hypertensive rats, normotensive rats, and WAG/Rij (Wistar Albino Glaxo from Rijswijk; another genetic rat model of absence epilepsy), as well as mouse strains (BALB/c and DBA), and found that none of these carry any copies of the R1584P mutation. NEC rats (which originate from a Wistar strain) and  (Brown Norway) also do not carry any copies of the R1584P mutation.Summary of the genetic alterations in the rat Cav3.2 T-type calcium channel geneThe epileptic phenotype that was attributable to the  was assessed in the progeny of an F1 cross between GAERS and NEC rats. Homozygous animals carrying either two copies of the  or null for the  were compared for the total amount of time spent in seizures during a 90 min EEG recording and also for the number, duration, and frequency of the seizures. Examples of EEG traces from an animal null for the  are shown in Figure 1,  and , from an animal heterozygous for the  in Figure 1,  and , and an animal homozygous for the  in Figure 1,  and . More F2 animals possessing two copies of the  (92.5%;  = 12) express seizures than animals possessing zero (50%;  = 8) or one copy (66.7%;  = 24) of the  ( = 0.058; m/m vs +/+; Fisher's exact test, one tailed). A strong  dose effect is evident for the time spent in seizure activity, with animals homozygous for the  spending significantly more time in seizure activity than animals null for the  (3.1 \u00b1 1.5%,  = 12 vs 0.5 \u00b1 0.4%,  = 8;  < 0.05) (Fig. 2). A significant association between the presence of the  and the number of seizures was also seen (Fig. 2). Animals homozygous for the mutation experienced 38.5 \u00b1 13.6 ( = 12) seizures compared with 10.5 \u00b1 8.1 ( = 8) seizures for animals null for the mutation ( < 0.05). Additionally, animals homozygous for the mutation had a significantly shorter interval between the seizures than animals null for the mutation (268.1 \u00b1 5364.8 s,  = 12 vs 4048.5 \u00b1 5321.9 s,  = 8;  < 0.05) (Fig. 2). The length of the individual seizures did not significantly differ between the three genotypes (zero copies, 3.01 \u00b1 0.95 s,  = 4; one copy, 3.03 \u00b1 0.7 s,  = 16; two copies, 3.1 \u00b1 0.87 s,  = 11;  > 0.05 null vs homozygous) (Fig. 2). The cycle frequency (hertz) of the spike-and-wave discharges accompanying the seizures was also not affected by the . Animals null for the mutation had a seizure frequency of 7.7 \u00b1 0.2 Hz, and animals homozygous for the mutation had a seizure frequency of 7.6 \u00b1 0.2 Hz ( > 0.05) (Fig. 2). Only animals that had seizures were included in the seizure duration and cycle frequency analysis.Representative EEG traces from m/m (, ), +/m (, ), and m/m (, ) animals over a 10 s period () and a 5 min period (). +/+ animals are null for the R1584P mutation (), +/m animals carry one copy of the mutation, and m/m animals are homozygous for the gcm mutation.The  mutation positively correlates with the epileptic phenotype in double-crossed (F2) GAERS versus NEC rats. , Percentage of recording time spent in seizure activity. Animals homozygous for the mutation spend more time in seizure activity than animals null for the  ( < 0.05, Mann\u2013Whitney one-tailed test). , Number of seizures. Animals homozygous for the  experience more seizures than animals null for the mutation ( < 0.05, Mann\u2013Whitney one-tailed test). , The interval between the seizures was significantly shorter for animals homozygous for the mutation compared with animals null for the mutation ( < 0.05, Mann\u2013Whitney one-tailed test). , The length of individual seizures did not significantly differ between the genotypes ( > 0.05, Mann\u2013Whitney one-tailed test). , The cycle frequency of the spike-and-wave discharges (hertz) did not significantly differ between the genotypes ( > 0.05, Mann\u2013Whitney one-tailed test). +/+ animals are null for the , +/m animals have one copy of the , and m/m animals are homozygous for the . Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. * < 0.05.Although our results provide evidence that the  plays a significant role in the absence epilepsy phenotype, they also demonstrate that the mutation does not, by itself, account for the entire phenotype. Some of the rats that were null for the  displayed absence seizures but significantly less often than those with the mutation. Similarly, there were rats that were positive for the  that either did not experience any (1 of 12) or experienced very few (2 of 12) absence seizures during the recording period. This is consistent with the current hypothesis that the determinants of the absence seizures in patients with IGE are polygenic (Crunelli and Leresche, 2002; Rudolf et al., 2004). A nonparametric Spearman's rank order correlation test was performed to examine the strength of the association between the number of copies of the  mutation in the F2 animals with their various seizure endpoints. A significant correlation was found for the percentage time in seizures ( = 0.31,  = 0.04) and the number of seizures occurring during the recording period ( = 0.34,  = 0.02). No significant correlation existed for the average length of the individual seizures ( = \u22120.17,  = 0.35) or for the cycle frequency (hertz) of the spike-and-wave discharges ( = 0.12,  = 0.52).We identified two major thalamic splice variants of the rat  that differ with respect to the presence or absence of exon 25. Cav3.2 (+25) transcripts include exon 25, whereas Cav3.2 (\u221225) transcripts exclude exon 25 (Fig. 3). We hypothesized that there may be a splice-variant-specific effect of  in (+25) versus (\u221225) because the  mutation is situated in the adjacent exon 24, only 13 aa upstream of the beginning of exon 25 region (Fig. 3). The inclusion of exon 25 results in an insertion of 18 nt (6 aa) plus the substitution of a lysine to a glutamate at the beginning of exon 26. Examination of adult Wistar full-length thalamic cDNA clones screened for splice variation ( = 76) showed approximately equal proportions of both splice variants [Cav3.2 (+25) = 51% and Cav3.2 (\u221225) = 48% of the total pool of Cav3.2 channels; data not shown]. Quantitative real-time-PCR analysis of the thalamus from >13-week-old NEC ( = 7) and GAERS ( = 7) animals revealed that there was no significant difference in the relative copy number of Cav3.2 mRNA [Cav3.2 (+25) + Cav3.2 (\u221225)] between NEC and GAERS animals (NEC, 178.2 \u00b1 23.4,  = 7; GAERS, 123.4 \u00b1 19.8,  = 7;  = 0.09). However, the ratio of Cav3.2 (+25) to Cav3.2 (\u221225) splice variants was \u223c1.5-fold greater in GAERS animals compared with the NEC strain [NEC, Cav3.2 (+25)/Cav3.2 (\u221225) = 0.91 \u00b1 0.06,  = 7; GAERS, Cav3.2 (+25)/Cav3.2 (\u221225) = 1.51 \u00b1 0.11,  = 7;  < 0.0001].Differential expression of Cav3.2 splice variants in NEC and GAERS animals. Exon 25 of the rat  gene is alternatively spliced to produce Cav3.2 (+25) and Cav3.2 (\u221225) isoforms. The Cav3.2 (\u221225) variant channels have a lysine residue at position 1598. This lysine residue is replaced by the 7 aa sequence (STFPNPE) in the Cav3.2 (+25) variant. The R1584P mutation () site is located 13 aa upstream of the beginning of exon 25 region (underlined arginine residue).Cav3.2 channel function was assessed electrophysiologically  using HEK293 cells transiently expressing either the Cav3.2 (+25) or the Cav3.2 (\u221225) splice variant \u00b1 the . The  had no significant effect on activation and inactivation kinetics, conductance, or steady-state inactivation of Cav3.2 channels in either splice variant (Fig. 4,, Table 2). The  also had no significant effect on the current density of either variant (Table 2). However, the  induced a splice-variant-specific gain of function in Cav3.2 (+25) biophysical properties that could be highly relevant to neuronal burst firing. Cav3.2 (+25)  channels recovered from an inactivating prepulse at a significantly faster rate (smaller slow recovery tau; \u03c42) than Cav3.2 (+25) channels (Fig. 4). Conversely, the -mediated gain of function was not observed in the Cav3.2 (\u221225) splice variant, in which the Cav3.2 (\u221225)  channels had a modestly slower rate of recovery (larger \u03c42) (Fig. 4, Table 2). As the  increases the rate of recovery from inactivation in Cav3.2 (+25), more of these channels are available to conduct during subsequent depolarizations, resulting in significantly larger Ca2+ currents from 80 to 2560 ms interpulse intervals (Fig. 4,). During multiple depolarizations, this would produce larger Ca2+ currents in cells expressing Cav3.2 (+25)  channels, potentially increasing excitability and promoting epileptogenesis (Contreras, 2006).The  accelerates rate of recovery from inactivation in the Cav3.2 (+25) splice variant. , , The conductance (filled symbols) of Cav3.2 (+25) () and Cav3.2 (\u221225) () and steady-state inactivation (open symbols) of Cav3.2 (+25) () and Cav3.2 (\u221225) () were not significantly altered by the . Insets (, ) show overlaid  and wild-type macroscopic currents during a 150 ms depolarizing pulse from a holding potential of \u2212110 to \u221220 mV. Activation and inactivation kinetics of Cav3.2 (+25) (, inset) and Cav3.2 (\u221225) (, inset) splice variant currents are not affected by the . Cav3.2 conductance was calculated from currents recorded during a series of depolarizing steps from a holding potential of \u2212110 mV to various membrane potentials and normalized to maximum conductance. Steady-state inactivation was calculated from Cav3.2 currents recorded during a test pulse to \u221230 mV directly after a 2 s inactivating prepulse of varying membrane potentials and normalized to peak current. , , The effect of the  on fractional recovery (determined by the ratio of the peak current at the test pulse to the peak current at the prepulse and fitted to a double exponential) is shown for Cav3.2 (+25) () and Cav3.2 (\u221225) (). Cav3.2 currents were recorded during test voltage pulses from a holding potential of \u2212110 to \u221230 mV after an inactivating prepulse, with an increasing interpulse interval. , , Representative traces obtained at test pulses after 160, 320, 640, and 1280 ms interpulse intervals are shown for Cav3.2 (+25) () and Cav3.2 (\u221225) () currents.

Cav3.2 (+25) -containing channels generated a significantly greater value for the charge transference factor in all subsequent bursts after one 125 Hz burst compared with Cav3.2 (+25) channels (Fig. 5). Conversely, the  had no effect on the charge transference factor during high-frequency bursts in Cav3.2 (\u221225) channels (Fig. 5). The increased charge transference factor observed in Cav3.2 (+25)  channels may be directly related to the increased rate of recovery from inactivation, because a faster recovery from inactivation may lead to an increase in the channels available to conduct on subsequent depolarizations.The  increases the charge transference of Cav3.2 (+25) during high-frequency burst depolarizing trains. , Representative traces of Cav3.2 (+25) wild-type () and Cav3.2 (+25)  () currents recorded during high-frequency depolarizing train pulses (125 Hz for 80 ms) from \u221270 to \u221220 mV occurring in bursts (5 Hz for 1 s) (). Charge transference of Cav3.2 during each burst was divided by the peak current on first pulse of the first burst to account for variations in current magnitude. , In Cav3.2 (+25), the  significantly increased the charge transference factor in all subsequent bursts after one 125 Hz burst. , In Cav3.2 (\u221225), the  had no significant effect on the charge transference factor.

We identified a mutation in GAERS () in the rat ortholog of , wherein mutations have been identified previously in human absence epilepsy patients (Chen et al., 2003; Liang et al., 2006, 2007; Heron et al., 2007). Examining crosses between NEC and GAERS animals, we found that the presence of the  mutation segregated with seizure expression in the F1 progeny. These results provide evidence that the  mutation plays a significant role in the absence epilepsy phenotype, but the mutation does not, by itself, account for the entire phenotype. Some rats that were null for the  still displayed absence seizures, albeit significantly less often than those possessing the mutation. Correlation analysis indicated that the presence of  accounted for approximately one-third of the variance for the percentage time in seizures and the number of seizures. These findings are consistent with the current idea that IGE is a polygenic disease (Crunelli and Leresche, 2002; Rudolf et al., 2004; Glasscock et al., 2007). Rudolf et al. (2004) mapped various seizure-related quantitative trait locus (QTL) in GAERS versus Brown Norway rat double crosses to chromosomes 4, 7, and 8. The relevant genes and genetic mutations within the regions represented by these QTLs have not been identified. Our group has reported an increase in expression of both stargazin mRNA and protein in the cortex and thalamus of GAERS (Powell et al., 2008), the gene for which () lies within the QTL on chromosome 7. However, the genetic cause for this is still unknown. The Rudolf study failed to identify a QTL on chromosome 10, the location of the Cav3.2 gene, but the primary seizure variables associated with the QTLs in this study were the duration, amplitude, and cycle frequency of the spike-and-wave discharges, which we found were not associated with the  (Fig. 2). The only significant association found with the number of seizures expressed, the variable that we found to be most strongly associated with , was with the QTL on chromosome 7 in 6-month-old (but not 3-month-old) rats. The only other genetic abnormality reported in GAERS is an extra alanine residue in a polyalanine tract in the potassium channel, KCNK9 (Holter et al., 2005). However, no functional consequences of this mutation have been identified  or .Our study also identified two major Cav3.2 channel splice variants expressed in the rat thalamus, Cav3.2 (+25) and Cav3.2 (\u221225), which differ in the presence or absence of the small exon 25. Of particular interest is the finding that the ratio of Cav3.2 (+25) mRNA to Cav3.2 (\u221225) mRNA is greater in the thalamus of GAERS animals compared with NECs, suggesting that the relative proportion of Cav3.2 (+25) to Cav3.2 (\u221225) is subjected to transcriptional regulation. Whether the increase in relative expression of the +25 variant in GAERS is a direct effect of  on splicing or an indirect effect on transcription is unknown.In Cav3.2 (+25) channels transiently expressed in HEK293 cells, the  induces a faster rate of recovery from inactivation, thereby promoting a Ca2+ charge transference of greater magnitude during burst firing conditions. Contrastingly, in Cav3.2 (\u221225) channels, the  modestly slows recovery and has no effect on charge transference during bursts. It would appear that the  increases the rate of recovery of Cav3.2 (+25) channels to a rate similar to that of channels without the 25 exon segment, Cav3.2 (\u221225). It is not known whether this is attributable to the separate mechanisms of  and exon 25 acting in opposition or whether the  acts to somehow silence the functional effect of exon 25 inclusion. Whether Cav3.2 (+25) and Cav3.2 (\u221225) splice variants are expressed selectively or coexpressed in the same cells is also unknown. If the splice variants are coexpressed within cells, there would be an expected heterologous population of both fast (\u2212 exon 25) and slow (+ exon 25) recovering channels in  +/+ animals. The occurrence of the  in m/m animals would drive all cells expressing Cav3.2 channels to a fast recovering type, which may increase synchrony of neuronal firing. Alternatively, if the splice variants are expressed in a mutually exclusive manner, the  change would be predicted to produce a cell-specific increase in excitability.T-type Ca2+ channels underlie a low-threshold spike that plays an important role in the generation of oscillatory thalamocortical rhythms and in the switch between tonic and burst firing patterns (Destexhe and Sejnowski, 2002; Contreras, 2006; Joksovic et al., 2006). Increased Cav3.2 expression and increased T-type currents have been detected in the nRT of GAERS and WAG/Rij (Tsakiridou et al., 1995; Talley et al., 2000; Kim et al., 2001; Broicher et al., 2008), suggesting that Cav3.2 channels may be a strong candidate for contribution to SWD generation in the thalamocortical network. This is supported by computational modeling, demonstrating that increased T-type activity has the ability to promote burst firing (Chorev et al., 2006) and that temporal changes in Cav3.2 conductance alone can synchronize oscillations (Huguenard and Prince, 1992). Thus, the larger currents achieved by the  in Cav3.2 (+25) channels during high-frequency bursts alone may be sufficient to induce oscillations. The  might render neurons of the nRT more susceptible to excitatory corticothalamic and thalamocortical inputs, producing more robust bursting activity. However, the net result of increased Ca2+ charge transference during high-frequency bursts is difficult to discern because of the intricacy of the neuronal network involved. In addition, although it may seem logical that the  would increase the duration of seizure activity attributable to longer-lasting Ca2+ conductance during burst firing, there is no direct evidence as yet to confirm that Cav3.2 channels are the molecular pacemaker controlling bursting. Aside from any direct biophysical effects of the mutation on excitability, it is also possible that increased Ca2+ entry might enhance Ca2+ signaling, with the potential to alter gene expression (Rudolf et al., 2004). Ca2+ as a signaling molecule has numerous cellular effects and Cav3.2 channels, for example, are known to induce increased expression of high-voltage-activated Ca2+ channels and to induce neuritogenesis (Chemin et al., 2002).The expression of different splice variants is now recognized as an important mechanism by which the diversity of cellular effects required for normal functions in different tissues and cell types is achieved. Splice variation in the Cav3.1 and Cav3.3 T-type Ca2+ channels has also been shown to alter electrophysiological properties and provides a general molecular mechanism for the functional diversity of T-type Ca2+ channels (Mittman et al., 1999a,b; Monteil et al., 2000; Chemin et al., 2001; Murbarti\u00e1n et al., 2002, 2004). Genetic mutations that have physiological effects only in selected splice variants may be an important mechanism by which some disease-causing mutations exhibit their well defined temporal and spatial phenotypes (Adams et al., 2007). As previously noted, alternative splicing of exon 26 in the human Cav3.2 gene (corresponding to the rat exon 25) alters the rate of recovery from inactivation (Ohkubo et al., 2005; Zhong et al., 2006). Our findings show that modification of rat exon 25 by the upstream  in Cav3.2 (\u00b125) splice variants can also alter the rate of recovery from inactivation. Thus, the III\u2013IV linker region of Cav3.2 appears to be critically involved in the recovery from inactivation of T-type channels, potentially modulating the stability of the inactivated state. Consistent with our findings, there is also evidence that the III\u2013IV linker region of Cav3.1 channels contributes to T-type channel inactivation (Chemin et al., 2001; Staes et al., 2001).Overall, the results of our study emphasize that the effects of missense mutations and the effects of alternative splicing on ion channel function must be considered together. Missense mutations that produce little or no direct changes in channel function may nevertheless interfere with regulatory sequences and lead to aberrant splicing, especially if, as found in the human Cav3.2 gene, some of the mutations flank splicing junctions (Liu et al., 2001; Zhong et al., 2006). Zhong et al. (2006) have described the splice variations in the human Cav3.2 gene and characterized their effects electrophysiologically (Zhong et al., 2006). Importantly, they demonstrated the interdependency of the effect of these variants. Our study extends this further to demonstrate that T-type channel mutations can have measurable functional effects in only certain splice variants. This provides a mechanism by which genetic mutations could produce spatial and temporal cell-type-specific effects dependent on splice variant expression patterns. This concept has potentially important implications for the pathophysiology of the IGEs wherein mild perturbations in the balance of activity between interconnected neuronal networks results in an epileptic phenotype but otherwise retains normal neurological functioning. It may also help explain both why somatic genetic mutations have been observed to result in seizures arising exclusively from topographically restricted focal brain regions (Fukata et al., 2006).This work was supported by National Health and Medical Research Council Grants 406640 (T.J.O., S.J.F.) and 454655 (C.A.R.), the Molly McDonnell Foundation Scholarship (K.L.P.), and Canadian Institutes of Health Research Grant 10677 (T.P.S.).

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the mitochondrial metabolism have been postulated to be the central source of molecular damages and imbalance between levels of intracellular ROS and antioxidant defenses is a characteristic of the aging brain. How aging modifies free radicals concentrations and increases the risk to develop most neurodegenerative diseases is poorly understood, however. Here we show that the Polycomb group and oncogene Bmi1 is required in neurons to suppress apoptosis and the induction of a premature aging-like program characterized by reduced antioxidant defenses. Before weaning, \u2212/\u2212 mice display a progeroid-like ocular and brain phenotype, while +/\u2212 mice, although apparently normal, have reduced lifespan. Bmi1 deficiency in neurons results in increased p19Arf/p53 levels, abnormally high ROS concentrations, and hypersensitivity to neurotoxic agents. Most  functions on neurons' oxidative metabolism are genetically linked to repression of  pro-oxidant activity, which also operates in physiological conditions. In \u2212/\u2212 neurons, p53 and corepressors accumulate at antioxidant gene promoters, correlating with a repressed chromatin state and antioxidant gene downregulation. These findings provide a molecular mechanism explaining how  regulates free radical concentrations and reveal the biological impact of  deficiency on neuronal survival and aging.Mitochondria are required for cellular aerobic respiration but are also the main source of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are thought to be causal for most oxidative damage that accumulates with age (Balaban et al., 2005; Halliwell, 2006; Lin and Beal, 2006). The balance between ROS and antioxidant molecules is critical to determine the rate of oxidative damage accumulation, and thus possibly cellular and organism lifespan (Harman, 1956).The role of the p53 gene in organism aging and on cellular oxidative metabolism remains highly controversial. A constitutively active form of p53 was shown to induce a premature aging-like phenotype in mice, while expression of a dominant-negative form of p53 in the CNS of  was shown to result in lifespan extension, both suggesting that  activity promotes aging (Tyner et al., 2002; Bauer et al., 2005). In cell lines, p53 overexpression can also repress glutathione -transferase \u03b11 (GST\u03b11), NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), and cystine/glutamate transporter (xCT) expression, and interfere with antioxidant defenses activated by Nrf2 (Faraonio et al., 2006). In contrast, transgenic mice expressing an extra dose of the  and  genes have reduced tumor incidence and extended median but not maximum lifespan, and show increased resistance to paraquat (Matheu et al., 2007). P53 is proposed to mediate these biological effects by reducing ROS through activation of Sestrin1 and Sestrin2 (Sablina et al., 2005; Matheu et al., 2007). Whether p53 is a proaging or antiaging gene and whether its activity is pro-oxidant or antioxidant thus remains an open question. is a member of the Polycomb group family. Polycomb group proteins form large multimeric complexes that silence specific target genes by modifying chromatin organization (Valk-Lingbeek et al., 2004). \u2212/\u2212 mice show axial skeleton defects and impaired development and degeneration of the cerebellum (Jacobs et al., 1999).  is required for the proliferation of hematopoietic and neural stem cells (Lessard and Sauvageau, 2003; Molofsky et al., 2003; Park et al., 2003). -deficient stem cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) proliferate poorly owing to derepression of the  locus (Jacobs et al., 1999; Molofsky et al., 2003). The  locus encodes two tumor suppressor proteins: p16Ink4a and p19Arf. P16Ink4a is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that blocks the activity of Cdk4/6 by preventing its association with cyclin D, which results in Rb hypophosphorylation and cell cycle arrest or senescence. P19Arf binds and inhibits the activity of the E3-ubiquitin ligase mouse double minute 2 (Mdm2), which prevents p53 targeting for proteasomal degradation (Sherr, 2001; Sharpless et al., 2004).We show here that Bmi1 is expressed in ocular tissues and in postmitotic neurons of the CNS. \u2212/\u2212 mice display a progeroid-like ocular and brain phenotype, while +/\u2212 mice have reduced lifespan. \u2212/\u2212 neurons are hypersensitive to several neurotoxic agents. They also present abnormally high ROS concentrations, increased p19Arf/p53 levels, and dramatic reduction in antioxidant defenses. Genetic and molecular analyses revealed that most  effects on neurons' oxidative metabolism are linked to repression of  pro-oxidant activity, which also operates in physiological conditions.\u2212/\u2212 mice (in the C57BL/6 background) are a gift from M. van Lohuizen (The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).  heterozygote mice (B6.129S2-Trp53tm1Tyj/J) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 inbred mice (Charles River) were maintained in our facilities and used in accordance with the Animal Care Committee of the Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital Research Centre.Embryonic day 18.5 cortical neuron cultures were established by mechanical dissociation of the cortices into a single-cell suspension. Cells were plated at 1.5 \u00d7 105 cells/well on poly-l-lysine-coated eight-well cultures slides (BD Biosciences) in serum-free media containing Neurobasal-A medium (Invitrogen), Glutamax-I (Invitrogen), gentamycin (50 \u03bcg/ml; Invitrogen), B27 supplement (Invitrogen), NGF (50 ng/ml; Invitrogen), and BDNF (0.5 ng/ml; Invitrogen). For the \u03b2-amyloid transfection experiments, the human \u03b2-amyloid (1\u201342 form) (from n1953 to n2081; GenBank accession no. NM_201413) cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR using human retina, and inserted into the DUAL-IRESGFP plasmid. The plasmid was purified on cesium chloride column by ultracentrifugation. Neurons were nucleofected with plasmid DNA using the Mouse Neuron Nucleofector Kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Amaxa Biosystems). In these experiments, electroporation efficiency was \u223c10%.Cultures were established from day 14 (MEFs) or day 18 (MELFs) embryos and cultured at 3% or 20% oxygen concentration in DMEM containing 10% FBS and gentamycin (50 \u03bcg/ml; Invitrogen). Cells were frozen after the first passage following establishment and were considered at population doubling zero (PD 0) at this point. Cell number was determined and population doubling calculated at each passage. MEFs (PD 0) were infected overnight with high-titer lentiviruses encoding either GFP or GSE22, a genetic suppressor element of p53 [for details on lentivectors used, see Beaus\u00e9jour et al. (2003)]. Lentiviral titers were adjusted to infect >90% of cells, and infection rates were verified by immunohistochemistry.For fixation, tissues were immersed for 1 h at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)/3% sucrose in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Samples were washed three times in PBS, cryoprotected in PBS/30% sucrose, and frozen in CRYOMATRIX embedding medium (CEM) (Thermo Shandon). Otherwise, tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin according to standard protocols. Five- to seven-micrometer-thick sections were mounted on Super-Frost glass slides (Fisher Scientific) and processed for immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry staining. For immunofluorescence labeling, sections were incubated overnight with primary antibody solutions at 4\u00b0C in a humidified chamber. After three washes in PBS, sections were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were mounted on coverslips in DAPI-containing mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). For immunohistochemistry labeling, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded slices were analyzed by using the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector) according to the manufacturer instructions. Peroxidase substrates used are the Vector VIP (pink) (Vector), and DAB (brown) (Sigma).

Following centrifugation at 10,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C for 10 min, pellets containing nuclei were dissolved in resuspension buffer (10 mm HEPES, 0.4 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors). Samples were ultracentrifuged at 55,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C for 10 min, and supernatants containing nuclear extracts were analyzed by immunoprecipitation. Otherwise, total protein extracts were prepared in buffer K (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mm KCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1% NP-40, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors). Proteins contents were quantified using the Bradford reagent. For immunoprecipitation, we used a sheep anti-p53 polyclonal antibody (EMD Biosciences), and Salmon Sperm DNA-protein A/G beads (Millipore). Beads with bound immunocomplexes were washed with buffer K, and bound proteins were heat eluted with Laemmli buffer. Eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAG electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose blotting membrane (Pall) that was exposed to an anti-acetylated lysine antibody (Cell Signaling). For Western blots on total protein extracts, the primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-p53 polyclonal antibody, anti-Nrf2 polyclonal antibody, and anti-PGC-1\u03b1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Sirt1 polyclonal antibody, anti-phospho-histone H2A.X monoclonal antibody (Millipore), and anti-\u03b2-actin monoclonal antibody (Abcam).

Microarray analysis using BeadChip Mouse Genome (Illumina) was performed at the Centre d'innovation at Genome Quebec (McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Data were analyzed using the FlexArray software.Senescence-associated (SA) \u03b2-galactosidase staining was detected histochemically at pH 6 as described previously (Dimri et al., 1995). Briefly, tissue slices were fixed in PBS containing 1% formaldehyde, 0.4% glutaraldehyde, and 0.02% Igepal. After three washes, slices were exposed to the X-gal solution (1 mg/ml X-gal; 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6; 5 mm K4Fe(CN)6; 1 mm MgCl2, in PBS; pH 6.0). Slides were mounted and observations made under a microscope (Leica DMRE, Leica Microsystems), and images were captured with a digital camera (Retiga EX; QIMAGING; with OpenLab, version 3.1.1 software).For apoptosis, activated caspase-3 staining was performed by IHC using a rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody (Cell Signaling). For the quantification of caspase-3-independent cell death (i.e., vacuolization), neurons' overall morphology was visualized by IHC using the rabbit anti-MAP2 (Cell Signaling). Grades of vacuolization were determined empirically according the vacuole density inside the cell. The measure is qualitative by nature (grade I, few small vacuoles, i.e., close to but not normal; grade II, more vacuoles: clearly abnormal; grade III, filled with vacuoles: near autolysis).Cortices were prepared on ice before homogenization while cultured embryonic neurons were collected following trypsin treatment (TrypLE Express, Invitrogen). Samples were homogenized in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer in 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4 (Merck). The dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA; Sigma) staining method was used for the quantification of ROS generation (Rad\u00e1k et al., 2004). The dye was added to the homogenates to achieve a final concentration of 25 \u03bcm. Fluorescence intensity was monitored using a fluorescence multiwell plate reader (Perseptive Biosystems), at excitation 485 nm and emission 530 nm. On the other hand, homogenates were tested for lipid peroxidation by measuring the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) according to the thiobarbituric acid reactive substrate (TBARS) method (Buege and Aust, 1978). The homogenates were mixed to 0.6% TBA mixture and boiled for 30 min. After cooling on ice, the chromogenic reaction was read in a spectrophotometer (Beckman) at 535 nm. Data are normalized to the amounts of proteins per sample.Statistical differences were analyzed using Student's  test for unpaired samples. An ANOVA followed by the Dunnett test was used for multiple comparisons with one control group. For nonparametric data analysis (i.e., cataract incidence phenomenon), a \u03c72 test was performed. The criterion for significance ( value) was set as mentioned in the figures.In the rodent eye, all retinal cells are postmitotic by postnatal day (d) 25, and we observed robust Bmi1 expression in retinal neurons, ciliary body epithelium (CBE), and lens cells of d25 and 9-month-old mice (Fig. 1, data not shown). Dual immunofluorescence using antibodies against the lineage-specific markers Chx10 and Pax6 showed that in the retina, Bmi1 is expressed in bipolar and ganglion cells and a subset of amacrine cells. Bmi1 was also detected in mouse and human photoreceptors (Fig. 1, data not shown). In the mouse brain, Bmi1 was expressed in cells of the upper cortical layers and the hippocampus, but not in the white matter (Fig. 1, data not shown). Most CNS neurons in both humans and mice expressed Bmi1 (Fig. 1,), while only some astrocytes in mice did (Fig. 1). These data indicate that Bmi1 is robustly expressed in ocular tissues and in nearly all postmitotic neurons of the developing and adult CNS of mice and men.Bmi1 is expressed in postmitotic neurons of the CNS. , Frozen eye sections from d25 WT and \u2212/\u2212 littermates were analyzed by immunofluorescence. No specific Bmi1 labeling was detected in \u2212/\u2212 samples. , Brain sections from d25 WT and \u2212/\u2212 littermates were analyzed as in . , Mouse and human brain sections were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (Bmi1 is in brown; MAP2, NeuN, and GFAP are in pink). Scale bars, 20 \u03bcm. onl, Outer nuclear layer; inl, inner nuclear layer; gcl, ganglion cell layer.During the course of our study, we found that \u223c90% of \u2212/\u2212 mice ( = 10,  = 0.001) in the C57BL/6 genetic background presented bilateral lens cataracts at d20\u2013d25 (Fig. 2); remaining \u2212/\u2212 mice had unilateral cataracts ( = 2). No cataracts were found in WT littermates at this early age ( = 10). Lens cataracts are well established biomarker of aging (The Italian-American Cataract Study Group, 1991; Wolf et al., 2005). In cell dissociation assays, we also found that the CBE of \u2212/\u2212 mice was more sensitive to protease treatment than that of WT littermates, with \u226590% of cell viability for 8 min of protease treatment for WT ( = 5), and \u226590% of cell viability at 6 min 50 s of protease treatment for \u2212/\u2212 ( = 3,  = 0.04). This suggests that Bmi1 deficiency compromises the structural integrity of the CBE extracellular matrix. Alterations of the extracellular matrix are found in eyes of aged mammals (Ihanam\u00e4ki et al., 2001). To evaluate whether the observed cataracts were due to a developmental defect or to accelerated aging, we tested the eyes for the presence of SA \u03b2-galactosidase activity, an enzymatic biomarker of cellular senescence (Dimri et al., 1995). We observed robust staining for the SA \u03b2-galactosidase activity in the lens, and weaker staining in the CBE of \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 2). Reactive gliosis in the retina and brain is observed in neurodegenerative diseases and CNS lesions and during normal aging in humans and mice (Silver and Miller, 2004). Likewise, \u2212/\u2212 mice had a reactive gliosis in the retina at d25 (Fig. 2). Upregulation of p16Ink4a and p19Arf genes has been correlated with normal tissue aging , and we could confirm this in the CNS of aging mice and humans by analyzing protein and gene expression (data not shown) (Krishnamurthy et al., 2004). We dissected eye structures (lens, retina, iris, and CBE) from WT and \u2212/\u2212 littermates at d25, and evaluated p16Ink4a and p19Arf genes expression. Compared with WT mice, expression of both genes was increased in most eye structures of \u2212/\u2212 mice, including the retina (Fig. 2). These findings reveal that  deficiency results in a premature aging-like ocular phenotype. deficiency results in an early aging-like phenotype in the eye. , Lenses from \u2212/\u2212 mice show visible cataracts (top panels). Frozen eye sections from WT and \u2212/\u2212 littermate mice were stained for SA \u03b2-galactosidase activity (arrowheads). , Immunofluorescence analysis of 3-week-old WT and \u2212/\u2212 mice retinal sections labeled with a GFAP antibody.

Scale bars, 20 \u03bcm. , Gene expression was analyzed by RT-PCR in WT, +/\u2212, and \u2212/\u2212 eye structures.  was used as internal standard.+/\u2212 mice are fertile and apparently normal, in contrast with \u2212/\u2212 mice, which present growth defects and a lethality rate exceeding 75% before weaning (Jacobs et al., 1999). However, we noticed that \u223c10% of +/\u2212 mice developed lens cataracts by the time of weaning, in contrast to their WT littermates, which did not have cataracts at this early age. This suggested the possibility that Bmi1 gene dosage may influence cellular aging and organism lifespan. To assess the potential involvement of Bmi1 gene dosage in the regulation of lifespan, we analyzed cohorts of WT and +/\u2212 mice in the C57BL/6 genetic background over a period of 36 months. In general, +/\u2212 mice were indistinguishable from their WT littermates. However, at 15 months of age they progressively presented features resembling those of 22- to 24-month-old C57BL/6 WT mice, such as hair loss covering >20% of body surface, lens cataracts, and reduced locomotor activity. Kaplan-Meyer analysis revealed that loss of one Bmi1 allele reduced the median and maximum lifespan by \u223c35% (Fig. 3). These data reveal that Bmi1 gene dosage can modulate lifespan. modulates lifespan and neuronal apoptosis in the CNS. , Kaplan-Meyer representation of the survival curves of WT and +/\u2212 mice (19 mice per cohort). Statistical significance was assessed using the log rank test relative to WT;  < 0.0001. , Cortical sections from d25 WT and \u2212/\u2212 littermates labeled with p19Arf and NeuN antibodies. Arrowheads indicate neurons expressing p19Arf. Scale bars, 20 \u03bcm. , Real-time PCR analysis of genes expression in the \u2212/\u2212 cortex (relative to WT). Results are mean \u00b1 SD ( = 4 sets of brains; ** < 0.01). , Immunohistochemistry analysis of WT and \u2212/\u2212 brain sections labeled with anti-caspase-3 antibodies. Data are expressed as the percentage of caspase-3+ nuclei over total hematoxylin-stained nuclei counts. Results are mean \u00b1 SD ( = 5; ** < 0.01).Consistent with Bmi1 expression in most postmitotic cortical neurons, we found a significant upregulation of Ink4a (174.9 \u00b1 33.7,  = 0.004),  (5.3 \u00b1 0.7,  = 0.002), and  (1.9 \u00b1 0.2,  = 0.006) in the cerebral cortex of \u2212/\u2212 mice ( = 3) at P20 when compared with WT littermates ( = 4), as measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Immunostaining also revealed robust p19Arf expression in individual cortical neurons (NeuN+) of \u2212/\u2212 mice, but not of WT littermates (Fig. 3). P19Arf increases p53 activity by inhibiting Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation (Sherr, 2006). The increased in p19Arf expression in retinal and cortical neurons of \u2212/\u2212 mice is thus predicted to increase p53 activity. One way p53 might promote aging in the CNS is by rending neurons more susceptible to apoptosis. Ectopic expression of p53 in mouse cortical neurons has been shown to induce apoptosis, and \u2212/\u2212 neurons are resistant to apoptosis induced by the topoisomerase I inhibitor and DNA-damaging agent camptothecin (Fortin et al., 2001; Cregan et al., 2004). We quantified the expression of p53 target genes involved in apoptosis in the cortex of \u2212/\u2212 mice. Puma, Noxa, Bcl2l2, and Apaf1 expression were significantly increased (Fig. 3). Furthermore, immunostaining for activated caspase-3, a marker of apoptosis, showed that, compared with WT, \u2212/\u2212 mice had a threefold to fivefold increased apoptosis in the cortex and hippocampus (Fig. 3).To evaluate p53 expression in the CNS of WT and -null mice, we performed Western blot analysis on cortical extracts using antibodies against p53. In these conditions, p53 was not detectable. We rationalized that this could be explained by a dilution effect. To test this, we first analyzed Bmi1 expression in the embryonic cortex at e18.5, and found robust expression in cortical neurons (Fig. 4). We then performed embryonic cortical neuron cultures from e18.5 WT and -null littermates, where >95% of cells present after 7 d were postmitotic neurons expressing the neuronal marker MAP2 along with Bmi1 (Fig. 4). As expected, Ink4a and  expression levels were increased in cultured \u2212/\u2212 neurons (Fig. 4). We measured total p53 levels by Western blot at day 7 of culture. We found that in \u2212/\u2212 neurons, the total amount of p53 was increased near 3.5 times at normal oxygen tension (data not shown). To further validate our findings, we cultured WT and \u2212/\u2212 neurons at 3% oxygen concentration, to reduce oxidative stress. Using these conditions, we observed that total p53 was increased \u223c1.8 times in \u2212/\u2212 neurons compared with WT (Fig. 4). One posttranslational modification linked to p53 activation is lysine acetylation, and recent work revealed that p53 acetylation (but not phosphorylation) is indispensable for its growth arrest and apoptotic activities (Vaziri et al., 2001; Tang et al., 2008). We found that the acetylated form of p53 was increased \u223c2.2 times in \u2212/\u2212 neurons at normal oxygen tension (Fig. 4). Because  deficiency may induce p53 activation through a p19Arf-independent pathway, such as through increased DNA damage, we measured \u03b3H2AX levels by Western blot and immunofluorescence. \u03b3H2AX is a DNA damage sensor that also helps to maintain genome integrity, and DNA damage is followed by the accumulation of \u03b3H2AX foci in the cell nucleus. In both WT and \u2212/\u2212 neurons, \u03b3H2AX expression was not detected by Western blot, and no differences could be observed either by immunofluorescence (Fig. 4, data not shown). Together, these results suggest that loss of  results in activation of a p53-dependent apoptotic cascade in the cerebral cortex, and reveal that p19Arf expression as well as total p53 level and p53 activation state are increased in cultured \u2212/\u2212 neurons.P53 expression level and activation state are enhanced in \u2212/\u2212 neurons. , , Bmi1 is expressed in embryonic cortical neurons. , Sections of mouse embryos (e18.5) were analyzed by IHC using a Bmi1 antibody. Bmi1 is highly expressed in neurons of the upper cortical layer. , Embryonic (e.18.5) neurons were cultured on poly-l-lysine substrate in serum-free media containing NGF and BDNF. Seven days later, they were labeled with Bmi1 and MAP2 antibodies and analyzed by immunofluorescence. Bmi1 (green) is coexpressed with the neuronal marker MAP2 (red) (arrowheads). Scale bars, 20 \u03bcm. , Real-time PCR analysis shows that Ink4a and  expression levels are increased in cultured \u2212/\u2212 neurons. Results are mean \u00b1 SD compared with WT levels set at 1 ( = 3\u20134 independent cell cultures; * < 0.05, ** < 0.01). , Western blot analysis shows that the expression levels of total and acetylated p53 are increased in cultured \u2212/\u2212 neurons. Data are calculated as ratios of p53 levels to those of \u03b2-actin. Ratios in \u2212/\u2212 samples are compared with the ratios in WT samples set at 1 ( = 3 independent cultures;  = 0.02 for p53 expression analysis, and  = 0.001 for acetylated p53 expression analysis). , Western blot analysis of cultured WT and \u2212/\u2212 neurons using an anti-\u03b3H2AX antibody shows that \u03b3H2AX is not detected under these conditions. WT neural stem cells irradiated at 10 Gy were used as positive control.Previous work revealed that \u2212/\u2212 MEFs proliferate poorly and become prematurely senescent at passage 3 (Jacobs et al., 1999). To evaluate the specific contribution of p53 to the phenotype of \u2212/\u2212 cells, we inhibited its activity in \u2212/\u2212 MEFs using a retrovirus expressing a dominant-negative form of p53 (GSE22). In mice, ambient oxygen (20%) concentration is sufficient to induce MEFs senescence through accumulation of oxidative damage and induction of p53 (Parrinello et al., 2003). To test the possibility that oxygen concentration may also influence the \u2212/\u2212 phenotype, we cultured MEFs at 3% and 20% oxygen concentration (Fig. 5). We found that inactivation of p53 in \u2212/\u2212 MEFs lead to a gradual but almost complete rescue of growth capabilities in either 3% or 20% oxygen tension, revealing that p53 inactivation alone is sufficient to rescue both premature senescence and proliferation defects caused by the loss of  in MEFs.Premature senescence and slow proliferation phenotypes of \u2212/\u2212 MEFs are p53 dependent. , , WT and \u2212/\u2212 MEFs were cultured under 3% or 20% oxygen concentration and population doublings (PD) were calculated at every passage. Cells were infected at PD 0 with a control retrovirus encoding GFP (-GFP) or GSE-22 (-GSE), a dominant negative peptide that inactivates p53. GSE can rescue the premature senescence phenotype of \u2212/\u2212 MEFs. , , BrdU incorporation assay (1 h exposure) reveals that GSE can restore \u2212/\u2212 MEFs proliferation rate close to that of WT-GFP or WT-GSE MEFs. Results are mean \u00b1 SD of triplicates (data are representative of 4 independent cell cultures; ** < 0.01).To address whether the apoptotic features observed in the CNS of \u2212/\u2212 mice were cell autonomous to neurons and p53 dependent, we used neuronal cultures. Neurons from both genotypes were treated with 1 \u03bcm camptothecin and analyzed in a time course (Cregan et al., 2004). Our data revealed that at 24 h, \u223c45% of \u2212/\u2212 neurons had disappeared from the cultures, compared with only \u223c12% for WT neurons (Fig. 6). A similar trend was found at 48 h (Fig. 6). Immunostaining of the cells 24 h after treatment using an antibody against the activated form of caspase-3 revealed a marked increase in apoptotic neurons in \u2212/\u2212 samples compared with WT (Fig. 6). To test the role of p53 in this context, we infected neurons with an adenovirus expressing a dominant-negative form of p53 (DNp53), which blocks p53 tetramerization and DNA binding-dependent transcriptional activity (Ferbeyre et al., 2002). In both WT and \u2212/\u2212 neurons, DNp53 rescued camptothecin-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6), showing that  deficiency results in a p53-dependent increased sensitivity to DNA damages cause by topoisomerase I inhibition.\u2212/\u2212 neurons are hypersensitive to neurotoxic agents. , Neurons were treated with camptothecin (CA; 1 \u03bcm) and labeled with MAP2 and caspase-3 antibodies. Data are expressed as the percentage of MAP2+/caspase-3+ cells over total MAP2+ cells. Results are mean \u00b1 SD ( = 5; * < 0.05; ** < 0.01) (left panel). Total number of viable neurons was calculated at time 0, 24, and 48 h after CA exposure for WT and \u2212/\u2212 neurons to generate a time course plot. Results are mean \u00b1 SD ( = 3; ** < 0.01 compared with WT) (right panel). , Neurons were treated with H2O2 (5 \u03bcm), and cell death was analyzed and expressed as the percentage of vacuolized MAP2+ cells over total MAP2+ cells. Results are mean \u00b1 SD ( = 5). Vacuolization grades reflect the degree at which neurons are affected; grade I, mildly affected; grade II, moderately affected; grade III, severely affected (left panel). Total number of viable WT and \u2212/\u2212 neurons was calculated at various H2O2 concentrations to define the EC50 values. Data were calculated using three independent cell cultures. Values in brackets are the EC50 values (right panel). , Neurons were electroporated with plasmids driving expression of A\u03b242, or A\u03b242 lacking the first ATG (control). Both A\u03b242 and control constructs carried the GFP transgene. We performed the analysis by counting the total number of neurons double positive for MAP2+ and GFP+ staining at different time points. Data are expressed as percentages relative to control-plasmid transfected WT neurons. Results are mean \u00b1 SD ( = 3; * < 0.05; ** < 0.01).Exogenously added H2O2 induces neuronal death mainly by activation of the MST/FOXO signaling pathway (Lehtinen et al., 2006). To test the resistance of \u2212/\u2212 neurons to this oxidant, we treated neurons with 5 \u03bcm H2O2. Sixteen hours later, we analyzed cell number, caspase-3 activation, and cellular morphology. Differences in cell viability were not found between WT and \u2212/\u2212 neurons (Fig. 6). Furthermore, addition of the DNp53 virus did not rescue either WT or \u2212/\u2212 neurons' viability. These data revealed that  deficiency does not alter neurons' sensitivity to H2O2.\u2212/\u2212 mice display a progeroid phenotype in the CNS and age is the prime risk factor to develop Alzheimer's disease. Based on this, we hypothesized that \u2212/\u2212 neurons are more sensitive to \u03b2-amyloid toxicity. Extracellular A\u03b242 peptide accumulates in senile plaques of Alzheimer's patient brains, but evidence reveals that intracellular A\u03b242 also accumulates in neurons, and that A\u03b242-induced cell death in neurons is mediated by p53 (Zhang et al., 2002; Ohyagi et al., 2005; LaFerla et al., 2007). We electroporated WT and \u2212/\u2212 neurons with plasmids driving expression of A\u03b242/GFP or of a mutated form lacking the first ATG. Time course analyses of cell survival at 48, 72, and 96 h after electroporation revealed that \u2212/\u2212 neurons were significantly more sensitive to intracellular A\u03b242 peptide toxicity than WT neurons (Fig. 6).Mitochondria are the main source of intracellular ROS. To test whether \u2212/\u2212 neurons were more sensitive to these metabolites, we treated neurons with 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP), a succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor. 3-NP exposure blocks complex II of the mitochondria respiratory chain, generates mitochondrial ROS, and leads to phase II antioxidant response genes activation by Nrf2 (Calkins et al., 2005; Shih et al., 2005). 3-NP treatment induced caspase-3-dependent (apoptosis) and caspase-3-independent (vacuolization) neuronal cell death (Fig. 7). \u2212/\u2212 neurons were significantly more sensitive than WT neurons to both forms of 3-NP-induced cell death (Fig. 7,). DNp53 rescued WT and \u2212/\u2212 neurons from caspase-3-dependent cell death, but only rescued \u2212/\u2212 neurons from caspase-3-independent cell death (Fig. 7). These results suggest that -deficiency possibly affects neurons' capacity to scavenge mitochondrial ROS.\u2212/\u2212 neurons are hypersensitive to the mitochondrial toxin 3-NP. , , E18.5 WT and \u2212/\u2212 neurons were exposed to 3-NP (2 mm) for 16 h. , Neurons were labeled with caspase-3 (brown) and MAP2 (pink) antibodies, and analyzed by IHC. Upon 3-NP exposure, most \u2212/\u2212 neurons presented caspase-3-dependent (arrowhead) or caspase-3-independent (vacuolization; arrow) cell death. Caspase-3-positive nuclei not expressing MAP2 represent remains of dead astrocytes or fibroblasts. Scale bar, 20 \u03bcm. , Data are expressed as the percentage of MAP2+/caspase-3+ cells over total MAP2+ cells (left panel) or as the percentage of vacuolized MAP2+ cells over total MAP2+ cells (right panel). Vacuolization grades are as described in Figure 6. Results are mean \u00b1 SD ( = 5; * < 0.05; ** < 0.01).To identify -regulated molecular pathways that could explain the increase sensitivity of \u2212/\u2212 neurons to a mitochondrial toxin, we performed DNA microanalyses on cultured embryonic cortical neurons. Because Bmi1 is a transcriptional repressor, we first focused on upregulated genes. Our data reveal that in \u2212/\u2212 neurons, there is an upregulation of most previously identified Bmi1-target genes, including p16Ink4a, p21Cip1, and Hox genes (Hoxa5, Hoxd8, and Hoxa7), as well as previously uncharacterized Bmi1-regulated homeobox genes (Engrailed 1 and Tal1) (Table 1) (Molofsky et al., 2003). New potential Bmi1-regulated genes involved in neurogenesis (dendrin, decorin, and neuritin), cell survival (Eda2r, Gria3, and \u03b1-synuclein), or neuronal functions (AMPA3, GABAA, and neurotensin) were also identified. Notably, we identified four genes involved in antioxidant defenses that are downregulated in \u2212/\u2212 neurons (Nrf1, GST-1\u03b1, Aldh6a1, and Sestrin1), suggesting that the oxidative metabolism may be affected by  deficiency (Table 1).List of genes whose expression is modulated in cultured \u2212/\u2212 neuronsTo test the possibility that  regulates the oxidative metabolism in neurons, we quantified ROS levels. Notably, we found a twofold increase in ROS concentrations in cultured \u2212/\u2212 neurons compared with WT (Fig. 8). Infection with the DNp53 adenovirus (or supplementation with the antioxidant -acetyl-cysteine) efficiently restored ROS concentrations to WT levels, suggesting that ROS accumulation in \u2212/\u2212 neurons is dependent on increased p53 activity (Fig. 8). Because DNp53 might also interfere with the function of other proteins, including the p53-family members p63 and p73 (Jacobs et al., 2006), we further assess the specific role of p53 in this context by using  knock-out mice. WT, \u2212/\u2212, \u2212/\u2212, and \u2212/\u2212\u2212/\u2212 embryos were used to establish cortical neuron cultures. After 1 week, we quantified ROS levels and found that genetic ablation of  could also prevent ROS accumulation in \u2212/\u2212 neurons (Fig. 8). These results suggest that in \u2212/\u2212 neurons, p53 is stabilized or activated, resulting in elevated ROS concentrations.Antioxidant defenses are deficient in \u2212/\u2212 neurons. , ROS concentrations were measured with the fluorescent dye DCFDA. Data were normalized to the protein contents and expressed as fold change relative to WT. Results are mean \u00b1 SD ( = 3 independent cultures; * < 0.05; ** < 0.01). , ROS levels in \u2212/\u2212 and \u2212/\u2212\u2212/\u2212 neurons. Measurements were done as in . , , Gene expression levels were analyzed by real-time PCR in \u2212/\u2212, DNp53-infected \u2212/\u2212, and \u2212/\u2212\u2212/\u2212 neurons. Dashed lines represent the basal gene expression level measured in WT neurons (normalized to 1). Results are mean \u00b1 SD ( = 5 independent cultures; * < 0.05; ** < 0.01). , Western blot analysis of neuronal extracts for the expression of Sirt1, Nrf2, and total and acetylated forms of PGC-1\u03b1. For PGC-1\u03b1 detection, proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-PGC-1\u03b1 antibody and Western blotting were done using anti-PGC-1\u03b1 antibody (total PGC-1\u03b1), or an anti-acetylated-lysine (K acet.). \u03b2-Actin was used as loading reference. , Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed with WT and \u2212/\u2212 neuronal extracts. Immunoprecipitated DNA/protein complexes were analyzed using primers directed against the ,  (2 sites), and \u03b2- promoters. Results are mean \u00b1 SD ( = 3 independent cultures; * < 0.05 compared with values in WT set at 1).To address how  deficiency leads to elevated ROS concentrations, we evaluated the expression of several antioxidant genes, including those previously linked to  activity, i.e., GST\u03b11, NQO1, xCT, Sestrin1, Sestrin2, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Sod1), and Mn superoxide dismutase (Sod2) in WT, \u2212/\u2212, \u2212/\u2212\u2212/\u2212, or DNp53-infected \u2212/\u2212 cultured neurons (Sablina et al., 2005; Dhar et al., 2006; Faraonio et al., 2006; Matheu et al., 2007). We found that compared with WT, expression of all tested genes was reduced in \u2212/\u2212 neurons, and that this reduction was most dramatic for phase II genes (Fig. 8). Importantly, DNp53 could restore the expression of most genes to WT levels in \u2212/\u2212 neurons, similarly as genetic ablation of  (Fig. 8,). We also cultured neurons at 3% oxygen concentration. We found that reducing oxygen concentration had no impact on ROS levels in \u2212/\u2212 and \u2212/\u2212\u2212/\u2212 neurons (Fig. 9, data not shown). These results reveal that abnormal antioxidant gene expression in \u2212/\u2212 neurons is genetically linked to  activity. is pro-oxidant in cultured neurons and in the CNS. , ROS levels in WT and \u2212/\u2212 neurons cultured at 3% or 20% oxygen concentrations. Data are represented as fold change relative to WT samples. Results are mean \u00b1 SD ( = 3; * < 0.05) (left panel). Expression levels of antioxidant genes in \u2212/\u2212 neurons were analyzed by real-time PCR. Dashed line represents the basal gene expression level measured in WT neurons (normalized to 1). Results are mean \u00b1 SD ( = 3 independent cultures; * < 0.05; ** < 0.01) (right panel). , ROS (left panel) and gene expression (right panel) levels in WT and \u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic lung fibroblasts (MELFs) were analyzed as in () ( = 3; * < 0.05; ** < 0.01). , Working model. , Upon oxidative stress, Nrf2 and PGC-1\u03b1 are recruited to antioxidant gene promoters to induce transcription. , In physiological condition, p53 may compete or not with Nrf2 and PGC-1\u03b1 for association at promoters, establishing equilibrium. ,  deficiency leads to increase p53 accumulation at promoters and to gene repression through recruitment of corepressors. The p53 repressor complex may or may not displace Nrf2 and PGC-1\u03b1 from the promoter.To further explore the underlying molecular mechanism, we compared the expression of Sirt1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 \u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1), and Nrf2 in WT and \u2212/\u2212 neurons. PGC-1\u03b1 and Nrf2 are activators of antioxidant defense genes in neurons, and Sirt1 can promote PGC-1\u03b1 activity by deacetylation (Calkins et al., 2005; Shih et al., 2005; St-Pierre et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2007). Sirt1, PGC-1\u03b1, and Nrf2 protein levels were modestly increased in \u2212/\u2212 neurons, and the acetylated form of PGC-1\u03b1 was slightly reduced (Fig. 8). No significant variations in gene expression were found by quantitative RT-PCR (data not shown). Thus, expression levels of PGC-1\u03b1, Nrf2, and Sirt1 are close to normal in \u2212/\u2212 neurons.To test the possibility that antioxidant genes are actively repressed by p53 in \u2212/\u2212 neurons, we performed ChIP experiments at the  and  promoters. When compared with WT, we found that p53 was enriched at the  and  promoters in \u2212/\u2212 neurons, and this correlated with a repressed chromatin state, as shown by the accumulation of bimethylated histone H3 at lysine 9 and 27 (Fig. 8) (Sparmann and van Lohuizen, 2006). No variations were found for acetylated histone H4, a mark of active chromatin. We also assess whether p53 accumulation at these regions of the chromatin was accompanied by the presence of corepressors. HDAC3/N-CoR and HDAC1/Sin3a corepressor complexes have been described in various systems (Jepsen and Rosenfeld, 2002; Karagianni and Wong, 2007). We found that HDAC1 and N-CoR were enriched at the  and  promoters in \u2212/\u2212 neurons. No variations were found at the \u03b2- promoter, which was used as an internal control (Fig. 8). These findings suggest that  deficiency results in increased ROS concentration in neurons due to a repressive action of p53 on the expression of antioxidant genes (see model in Fig. 9).In physiological conditions,  is proposed to have an antioxidant activity in most tissue and primary cell lines, such as in embryonic lung fibroblasts (Matheu et al., 2007). However, we found that genetic ablation of  in \u2212/\u2212 neurons could restore ROS to normal levels, showing that  is pro-oxidant in this pathological context. To explore the possibility that  is also pro-oxidant in neurons in physiological conditions, we established neuronal and lung fibroblast cultures from WT and \u2212/\u2212 embryos at 3% and 20% oxygen concentration. At day 7 after plating (neurons) or passage 1 (lung fibroblasts), we measured ROS level and compared gene expression. Notably, \u2212/\u2212 neurons showed reduced ROS level when compared with WT at both oxygen concentrations (Fig. 9). In contrast, \u2212/\u2212 lung fibroblasts presented increased ROS concentrations in the same conditions (Fig. 9). Consistently,  deficiency in neurons resulted in upregulation of , \u03b1, , and  expression when compared with WT, with the exception of , which expression was modestly reduced (Fig. 9). In contrast, \u03b1, , and  expression was reduced in \u2212/\u2212 lung fibroblasts, while  expression was increased (Fig. 9). Little variations in ROS levels were observed by modifying oxygen concentration in neurons, but not in MELFs (Fig. 9,). To validate these observations , we compared lipid peroxidation and gene expression in the brain, lung, and liver of WT and \u2212/\u2212 littermates at 2 months of age. Lipid peroxidation is the result of cumulative oxidative damage to cell membranes and thus reflects imbalance in ROS levels. Analysis of older -null mice was not possible due to the rapid development of tumors in these animals. When compared with WT, we found that lipid peroxidation levels were much higher in the liver and lung of \u2212/\u2212 mice and significantly lower (by 42%) in the brain (Table 2). Furthermore, real-time PCR analyses revealed that antioxidant gene expression levels are significantly higher in the cortex of -null mice than in their WT littermates (Table 2). Thus, in sharp contrast with the proposed general antioxidant function of  (Matheu et al., 2007), our results demonstrate that  is pro-oxidant in neurons and in the CNS of mammals in pathological and physiological conditions (see model in Fig. 9). is pro-oxidant in the central nervous systemThe Bmi1 oncogene has been extensively studied for its role in the maintenance of cell proliferation (Sparmann and van Lohuizen, 2006). However, Bmi1 is also widely expressed in postmitotic ocular tissues and in neurons of the adult CNS (this study). Here, we uncover a new function for  in controlling survival and antioxidant defenses in neurons through repression of  proapoptotic and pro-oxidant activities. These findings have implications for the understanding of normal CNS aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases.We have shown that ,  RNA and protein expression levels are increased in \u2212/\u2212 neurons, and that the downstream p53 apoptotic cascade is activated. , \u2212/\u2212 neurons have increased total and activated p53 protein levels, are hypersensitive to camptothecin-induced apoptosis, and can be rescued by the DNp53 virus. These data suggest that p53 mediates most of the apoptotic phenotype observed in \u2212/\u2212 neurons. We also found that \u2212/\u2212 neurons also present abnormally high free radical concentrations and are hypersensitive to a mitochondrial toxin, implying a role for  in regulation of mitochondria oxidative metabolism. Genetic inactivation of  revealed that deregulation of the oxidative metabolism in \u2212/\u2212 neurons is mostly, if not entirely, mediated by . This is supported by the observation that antioxidant gene levels in \u2212/\u2212\u2212/\u2212 neurons (where xCT and GST have supraphysiologic levels) are almost identical to those observed in \u2212/\u2212 neurons (compare Fig. 8 with Fig. 9). However, total ROS levels are apparently distinct between \u2212/\u2212\u2212/\u2212 and \u2212/\u2212 neurons (compare Fig. 8 with Fig. 9). These observations suggest that most but maybe not all  functions are mediated through repression of  activity. These additional functions may be explained by p19Arf-mediated actions through Mdm2 on the p63 and p73 protein variants, which are also expressed in CNS neurons (Jacobs et al., 2006).Upon accumulation of mutations, p53 promotes apoptosis or senescence in premalignant tissues to prevent carcinogenesis (Sherr, 2001; Sharpless et al., 2004). One way p53 may promote mitochondria-mediated cell death in dividing cells is by increasing ROS concentrations through repression of antioxidant genes (Dhar et al., 2006; Faraonio et al., 2006). Paradoxically, p53 was proposed to stimulate antioxidant defenses in various organs in physiological conditions through its positive action on Sestrin(s), and thus protect the genome from accumulation of mutations by lowering intracellular ROS levels (Sablina et al., 2005; Matheu et al., 2007). During development,  has a function in eliminating supernumerary neurons and neuronal progenitors (Jacobs et al., 2006). Later on,  is required to prevent tumor development from progenitor/stem cells, oligodendrocytes, or astrocytes. However, p53 activity is apparently not required in adult neurons, which are postmitotic and not tumor prone. Rather, all evidence suggests that p53 activity in neurons is pathological (Zhang et al., 2002; Bae et al., 2005; Ohyagi et al., 2005; Nair, 2006; Nair et al., 2006; Kieran et al., 2007).We found here that in contrast with other organs and cultured lung fibroblasts,  is pro-oxidant in brain tissue and cultured neurons. Our data argue that  is always active in neurons to levels that are pro-oxidant, in sharp contrast with other cell types. Notably, expression of a dominant-negative form of p53 in the CNS of , but not in other organs, was shown to result in lifespan extension and improved resistance to paraquat, suggesting that the deleterious function of p53 in neurons is conserved in insects (Bauer et al., 2005). These observations may explain why transgenic mice with extra copies of  and  do not have an increase in maximum lifespan, despite being protected from tumor burden (Matheu et al., 2007). In these animals, increasing p53 gene dosage is predicted to increase oxidative damage accumulation in the CNS, which is unlikely to promote lifespan extension.The function of  on the antioxidant defense system appears to overlap only partially with that of \u03b1. \u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice show only a modest reduction in the basal expression level of Sod1, Sod2, and catalase genes in the brain, but \u03b1\u2212/\u2212 cells are highly inefficient to activate antioxidant genes expression when challenged with oxidants (St-Pierre et al., 2006). In contrast, \u2212/\u2212 neurons have abnormally low basal expression levels for most antioxidant genes, yet can still respond to 3-NP treatment by activating phase II gene expression, although less efficiently (data not shown). These observations suggest that  deficiency results in the constitutive repression of antioxidant genes (model in Fig. 9), while \u03b1 deficiency results in defective activation of antioxidant genes upon acute oxidative stress. In contrast to \u2212/\u2212 neurons, \u03b1\u2212/\u2212 cells are also more sensitive to the action of H2O2. Importantly, catalase, which scavenges H2O2, is mostly present in the nonmitochondrial cytoplasm and peroxisomes, and thus may be more protective against exogenous H2O2 than against mitochondrial ROS. Catalase is the only antioxidant gene we tested which expression is unaffected in \u2212/\u2212 neurons.The free radical theory of aging proposes that cellular and DNA damage produced by mitochondrial ROS are the causal factor of cellular and organismal aging (Harman, 1956), and we have shown here that loss of  leads to a dramatic reduction in antioxidant defenses and to concomitant increase in ROS concentrations. Furthermore, \u2212/\u2212 neurons are hypersensitive to neurotoxic agents and have an elevated level of spontaneous apoptosis in nontoxic conditions when compared with WT neurons. Together, these results provide a most plausible mechanism to explain why -deficient mice and neurons age prematurely. In the context of normal aging, our finding brings the possibility that reduced  expression in human brain neurons may contribute to the age-associated reduction in antioxidant defenses, leading to accumulation of oxidative damage and to neuronal dysfunction. The activity of  against mitochondrial ROS may be also relevant to age-associated neurodegenerative diseases where cell death is apparently mediated by oxidative damage, such as in Parkinson disease (Thomas and Beal, 2007).  activity against p53-mediated neuronal apoptosis may be relevant to Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases. P53 expression is increased in Alzheimer's disease brains, its transcription is activated by intracellular A\u03b242, and p53 inhibition prevents A\u03b242-induced neuronal cell death (Zhang et al., 2002; Ohyagi et al., 2005). We found here that  deficiency sensitizes neurons to apoptosis induced by the intracellular A\u03b242 peptide. Because this system is far from physiological conditions, more work will be required to evaluate the possible implication of BMI1 in Alzheimer's disease. In the Huntington's disease brain, complex II activity is reduced, and 3-NP administration results in a striatal movement disorder in rodents and primates resembling Huntington's disease (Lin and Beal, 2006). Notably, p53 is activated by mutant Huntingtin protein (Bae et al., 2005). We found that  deficiency dramatically increases neurons' vulnerability to 3-NP toxicity and that p53 inhibition can rescue this phenotype. Our study reveals how the activity of  in postmitotic neurons is required to block the induction of a proapoptotic and pro-oxidant molecular aging program mostly driven by .This work was supported by grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada, and Turmel Family Foundation for Macular Degeneration Research.

Processing of such information arises from the interaction between OB output neurons local interneurons, as well as interactions between the OB network and centrifugal inputs. Cholinergic input to the OB in particular has been hypothesized to regulate mitral cell odorants receptive fields (ORFs) and behavioral discrimination of similar odorants. We recorded from individual mitral cells in the OB in anesthetized rats to determine the degree of overlap in ORFs of individual mitral cells after exposure to odorant stimuli. Increasing the efficacy of the cholinergic neurotransmission in the OB by addition of the anticholinesterase drug neostigmine (20 mm) sharpened the ORF responses of mitral cells. Furthermore, coaddition of either the nicotinic antagonist methyllycaconitine citrate hydrate (MLA) (20 mm) or muscarinic antagonist scopolamine (40 mm) together with neostigmine (20 mm) attenuated the neostigmine-dependent sharpening of ORFs. These electrophysiological findings are predictive of accompanying behavioral experiments in which cholinergic modulation was manipulated by direct infusion of neostigmine, MLA, and scopolamine into the OB during olfactory behavioral tasks. Increasing the efficacy of cholinergic action in the OB increased perceptual discrimination of odorants in these experiments, whereas blockade of nicotinic or muscarinic receptors decreased perceptual discrimination. These experiments show that behavioral discrimination is modulated in a manner predicted by the changes in mitral cell ORFs by cholinergic drugs. These results together present a first direct comparison between neural and perceptual effects of a bulbar neuromodulator.Cholinergic inputs to cortical processing networks have long been proposed to be associated with attentional and top-down processing (Hasselmo et al., 1992; Sarter and Bruno, 1997; Sarter et al., 2005; Yu and Dayan, 2005; Hasselmo and Giocomo, 2006). In primary sensory areas, several studies have associated acetylcholine with contrast modulation and changes in neuronal receptive fields as well as the plasticity of receptive fields (Metherate et al., 1988; Metherate and Weinberger, 1990; Wilson, 2001; Weinberger, 2003; Roberts et al., 2005; Timofeeva et al., 2005). Because of the strong correlations between sensory inputs, neural activity, and perception, the transformation of sensory perception by cholinergic inputs is directly measurable in the olfactory bulb (OB) of rodents (Linster et al., 2001b; Cleland et al., 2002, 2007; Cleland and Linster, 2005). Experimental and modeling data indicate that the main OB (MOB) plays a critical role in feature extraction, noise reduction, and contrast enhancement of odor-evoked sensory information (for review, see Cleland and Linster, 2005). A crucial function of the OB is to integrate afferent information from the sensory neurons in concert with descending cortical and neuromodulatory inputs from central structures such as the piriform cortex, basal forebrain, and brainstem (Hal\u00e1sz and Shepherd, 1983; Shipley and Ennis, 1996). One important modulatory pathway to the OB originates in the nucleus of the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca (HDB), which supplies cholinergic and GABAergic innervation from the basal forebrain system to the MOB (Heimer et al., 1990). Accumulating evidence indicates that olfactory discrimination is at least partially mediated by processes in the OB (Mandairon et al., 2006a, 2008a; Doucette et al., 2007) and that cholinergic centrifugal inputs to the OB modulate perceptual discrimination (De Rosa et al., 2001; Linster and Hasselmo, 2001; Linster and Cleland, 2002; Mandairon et al., 2006b).To directly assess the relationship between neural and perceptual modulation by cholinergic receptor activation in the OB, we here measure the modulation of mitral cell odorant receptive fields (ORFs) by cholinergic agents infused directly into the olfactory bulb. In a parallel experiment, we measure the effects of the same drug infusions on spontaneous and reward-driven odor discrimination. We find that enhancement of cholinergic modulation in the OB via local infusions of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor neostigmine narrows the representation of odorants and increases the number of mitral cells exhibiting differential responses to chemically and perceptually similar odorants. In behavioral experiments, the same enhancement of cholinergic inputs leads to an increase in perceptual discrimination between chemically similar odorants. Blockade of both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors in the OB abolishes the overall effect of neostigmine on neural responses, a result paralleled by a decrease in behavioral discrimination after cholinergic receptor blockade. The present results show, for the first time, a predictive relationship between modulation of neural and perceptual odor discrimination.Adult male Sprague Dawley rats (200\u2013250 g) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Rats were housed in individual cages with water and food available . Animals were maintained in a 12 h light/dark cycle. All procedures were performed under guidelines established by the Cornell University Institutional Animal Care and Use committee and the National Institutes of Health guidelines.Animals were anesthetized with urethane (1.5 g/kg, i.p.; Sigma) and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus (Narishige). The skull was exposed by scalpel incision, and a hole was drilled over the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) [+3.7 mm anteroposterior (AP); 3.4 mm mediolateral (ML); 6.5 mm dorsoventral (DV)] and over the olfactory bulbs (5.2 mm AP; 1.8 mm ML). Respiratory activity was monitored throughout the experiments using a piezoelectric monitor strapped around the animal's chest. Signals from the respiratory output were sent to the computer enabling synchronization of odor delivery with inhalation.Three drugs were used in this study: the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor neostigmine (20 mm), the nicotinic receptor antagonist methyllycaconitine citrate hydrate (MLA) (20 mm), and the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine (40 mm). All drugs were dissolved in 0.9% saline, and 6 \u03bcl were delivered per MOB. The dosage used was based on previously published studies in which the cholinergic drugs were directly infused into the olfactory bulb (Ravel et al., 1994; Mandairon et al., 2006b). A higher dosage of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor was found to be necessary to obtain significant effects in the anesthetized preparation compared with behavioral experiments, presumably because of the absent or low activation of the cholinergic system in this state. The infusion volume of 6 \u03bcl had been determined previously to be sufficient to distribute into the whole MOB (Ravel et al., 1994; Mandairon et al., 2006a,b, 2008a) without spilling beyond the main and accessory olfactory bulbs. Drugs were administered \u223c20 min before the recording session because this had been shown to be sufficient time for drug action (Mandairon et al., 2006b). Drugs were delivered using a stereotaxic syringe pump (Stoelting) attached to a 50 \u03bcl Hamilton syringe at an infusion rate of 0.50 \u03bcl/min. At the beginning of the experiment, the syringe was lowered into the OB targeting the center of the OB (+8.0 mm AP; \u00b11.5 mm ML; \u22125.5 mm DV from bregma). Previous experiments have shown that a drug volume of 6 \u03bcl infused at 0.5 \u03bcl/min at this position is sufficient to diffuse throughout the OB without spilling beyond the main and accessory OB (Mandairon et al., 2006a,b).Odorants used were ethyl acetate (E2), ethyl propionate (E3), ethyl butyrate (E4), ethyl valerate (E5), and the carrier control mineral oil (MO). These odorants are part of a family of odorants shown to produce perceptual similarity gradients: as the difference in carbons between two odorants increases, their perceptual similarity also decreases (Linster and Hasselmo, 1999; Linster et al., 2001a; Cleland et al., 2002; Cleland and Narla, 2003). Odorants were delivered by passing a stream of humidified, charcoal-filtered air and mixed with a stream of specific pure humidified odorants (1:50 dilution). The odor protocol consisted of a 2 s odor delivery separated by a 60 s interstimulus interval. Each odor was presented five times, and odors were presented in pseudorandom order.Bipolar stimulating electrodes (100 \u03bcm stainless steel, Formvar insulated) were placed in the LOT to evoke antidromic action potentials. Unit recordings and extraction of action potentials followed standard methods (Wilson, 2000; Fletcher and Wilson, 2003). Stimulation currents (100 ms duration, 200\u2013900 \u03bcA) were delivered by a constant-current stimulus isolation unit (model PSIU6) controlled by a Grass S88 stimulator (Grass-Telefactor). Neuronal responses were recorded using a monopolar tungsten electrode (5\u201310 M\u03a9; A-M Systems). Electrodes were lowered into the mitral cell layer using a fine control micromanipulator (David Kopf Instruments). Optimal placement of the recording electrode into the mitral cell layer of the MOB was achieved by monitoring the size and shape of field potentials (amplified 1000\u00d7; low-pass filter, 0.1 Hz; high-pass filter, 475 Hz; sampled at 20 kHz) after LOT stimulation (for details, see Haberly, 1973). Single units (amplified 5000\u00d7; low-pass filter, 600 Hz; high-pass filter, 6 kHz; sampled at 20 kHz) were recorded in the dorsomedial region of the OB known to be responsive to ethyl esters of differing hydrocarbon chains (Wilson, 2000; Fletcher and Wilson, 2003). Single units were recorded using the Spike 2 software (Cambridge Electronics Design). Single units were initially isolated online and more rigorously extracted by offline template matching.Single units were extracted offline using Spike 2 software. First, templates of spikes were selected from the raw data and then extracted from the whole dataset. Extracted spikes were separated through principal component analysis (PCA; Spike 2 software) whereby features from the data are extracted and clustered to groups of similar waveforms. PCA allows the removal of \u201cnoise\u201d and the separation of two or more separate spikes that may have been detected by the electrode. After spike sorting, the number of spikes were automatically counted 4 s before and 4 s after each odor onset.At the end of the experiment, positive current was passed through the electrodes (5 s via a 9 V battery) to produce a small lesion. Transcardial perfusion was then performed with saline and 10% Formalin. Brains were sectioned at 40 \u03bcm and subsequently stained with neutral red for electrode localization.We first determined whether a given cell exhibited significant changes in firing rate after exposure to at least one odor by comparing the number of spikes 4 s before odor delivery with that 4 s after odor onset (paired  test,  = 0.05) (Wilson, 2000). Cells that responded significantly to at least one of the odorants were used in all subsequent analyses. Among these cells, we then determined whether the response of any given cell was significantly dependent on odor identity under each drug condition (ANOVA with the difference between pre-odor and post-odor response as main measure and odor as main effect) and whether the cell differentiated between pairs of odorants [ comparisons, Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) test with  = 0.05]. For comparisons between the different drug conditions, an ANOVA on the proportion of cells that differentiated between two odorants was performed, followed by  pairwise comparisons (Fisher's LSD test) to determine which drug group was significantly different from the others.Eight male Sprague Dawley rats (250\u2013300 g) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories. Rats were kept alone in standard laboratory cages on a 12 h light/dark cycle at a constant temperature. During the testing of spontaneous discriminations (experiment 1), rats were allowed access to food and water . During the reinforced olfactory discrimination task (experiments 2), rats were maintained on a food-deprivation schedule designed to keep them at \u223c85\u201395% of their body weight over the behavioral testing period. Water was continuously available. Behavioral experiments were conducted in the afternoon (1400\u20131800). All procedures were performed under the auspices of a protocol approved by the Cornell University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Rats were shaped to perform the digging task used for the food-reinforced tasks before cannulation. Rats were first exposed to the two-chambered experimental box used for the procedure over several days until they became accustomed to it, and then they were taught to retrieve a reward (General Mills Frosted Cheerios, preexposed to heat and air to reduce odor) by digging in dishes of corncob bedding (Bed-O-Cobs; The Andersons).Rats were anesthetized with an intramuscular mixture injection of 50 mg/kg ketamine and 7.5 mg/kg xylazine (in a volume of 1 ml/kg) and secured in a stereotaxic instrument (Narishige). Cannulas (22 gauge; Plastics One) were inserted bilaterally into the OBs according to standard procedures (Mandairon et al., 2006a,b, 2008b). Cannulas were implanted at the following coordinates with respect to bregma: +8.0 mm AP; \u00b11.5 mm ML; \u22124.5 mm DV. The tips of the guide cannulas were positioned 1 mm dorsal to the target infusion site; consequently, infusion cannulas extended 1 mm from the end of the guide cannulas. Five screws were drilled into the skull, and dental cement was used to secure the guide cannulas and cover the incision area. Dummy infusion cannulas were then placed into the guide cannulas to prevent blockage or infection. After surgery, rats were allowed to recover for 10 d. For drug administration, two infusion cannulas were fitted into the guide cannulas so that their tips protruded 1.0 mm beyond the ends of the guide cannulas into the center of each MOB. Two 10 \u03bcl Hamilton syringes containing either drug solutions or vehicle (plain saline) were attached to the cannulas with a polyethylene tube and driven with paired infusion pumps (YA-12 Genie pumps; Kent Scientific).Three cholinergic agents were used in this study: the nicotinic receptor antagonist MLA (19.0 mm, 6 \u03bcl delivered per MOB; obtained from Tocris Cookson), the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine (38.0 mm, 6 \u03bcl delivered per OB; obtained from Sigma-Aldrich), and the blood\u2013brain barrier-impermanent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor neostigmine (8.7 mm, 6 \u03bcl delivered per MOB; Sigma-Aldrich). Infusion volume and drug concentrations were those determined to yield significant effects in a previous study (Mandairon et al., 2006b). Drugs were delivered bilaterally into awake rats at a rate of 2 \u03bcl/min for 3 min (6 \u03bcl total volume delivered per side). The infusion cannulas remained in place for 1 additional minute after the infusion ended to minimize backflow. Behavioral testing was performed 20 min after drug administration was completed.To allow for repeated testing under all four drug conditions without repeatedly presenting the same odorants, four odor sets were used for the behavioral experiments (Table 1). Each odor set consisted of a homologous series of aliphatic molecules with unbranched carbon chains presenting the same perceptual characteristics as those used in the electrophysiological experiments: odorants are perceived as increasingly dissimilar from each other as the difference in carbon chain length increases (Linster and Hasselmo, 1999; Cleland et al., 2002; Cleland and Narla, 2003). The three test odorants in each odor set were used for all drug conditions to allow for higher resolution of drug effects compared with our previous study (Mandairon et al., 2006b). All odorants were diluted in mineral oil so as to theoretically emit a steady-state vapor phase partial pressure of 1.0 Pa (Cleland et al., 2002). For each experiment, rats were exposed to each odor set only once. Experiments were separated by 2 weeks from each other to prevent interference between experiments.Odorsets and dilutions used for behavioral experimentsAn olfactory cross-habituation task assesses the degree to which rats spontaneously discriminate odorants by habituating them to one odorant (hab) and then measuring the magnitude of their novelty response to a second odorant (test). Presentation of a novel odorant will elicit substantial investigation of the new stimulus; however, if the second odorant is perceived as similar to the habituated odorant (i.e., it is poorly discriminated), the rat will spend less time investigating the second odorant when it is presented. Because no reward is associated with either odorant in this task, and each test odor is presented only once, this task is used to measure baseline perceptual similarities between odorants, unaltered by a history of reinforcement. All habituation experiments took place in the home cages of the test animals under red light. All odors were diluted in mineral oil according to Table 2 and prepared before each experiment; odor sets were double blinded so that the experimenter was unaware of the identity of each odor. Odors were presented by placing 60 \u03bcl of the odor stimulus onto a filter paper disc (Whatman #1) contained within a weighing dish that was placed on top of the wire cage lid. This procedure enabled the observer to change the odor stimulus without unduly disturbing the animal. Each test session was preceded by one 50 s presentation of plain mineral oil. Test sessions comprised four 50 s presentations of the habituation odor at 5 min intervals, followed by three 50 s presentations of test odorants in randomized order. The amount of time that the rat spent actively investigating each presented odorant was measured. Active investigation was defined as directed sniffing within 1 cm of the odor source. Individual rats were repeatedly tested under different drug conditions but encountered different odor sets under each condition to prevent rats from becoming familiar with the odorants. The order of presentation of odor sets and the pairing of odor sets with drug conditions were counterbalanced.Summary of spontaneous discrimination resultsData analyses were performed using SPSS statistical software with the time spent investigating odor stimuli during presentation trials as the dependent variable. Because habituation is necessary to assess discrimination ANOVA was performed across the four habituation trials, followed by Fisher's  pairwise comparisons to determine whether rats in each drug treatment group habituated to the habituation odor (significant decrease in investigation time between the first and fourth habituation trials). Separate ANOVAs followed by Fisher's  pairwise comparisons were subsequently performed to determine whether rats in each drug treatment group (1) exhibited reduced spontaneous discrimination between habituated and test odors (one, two, or three carbon difference from habituated odor) compared with vehicle-injected animals, and (2) discriminated significantly between the habituation and test odors, as indicated by a significant increase in investigation time during the test trial when compared with the fourth habituation trial. The criterion for significance was set to \u03b1 = 0.05.In this experiment, we tested how discrimination between a conditioned and novel test odorant is modulated by cholinergic inputs using the same odor sets as in experiment 1.Rats were conditioned to the conditioned odor (cond) by retrieving a reward buried in a scented dish during eight successive trials in which it had a choice between a scented dish containing the reward and an unscented dish containing no reward. The strength and precision of the odor\u2013reward association was then tested in four unrewarded test trials during which time rats spent looking for the reward in the conditioned odor and the three test odors was recorded. This task, described in detail previously, assesses the degree to which rats associate a reward with an odorant after several training trials as well as to what degree this association is odor specific (Linster and Hasselmo, 1999; Cleland et al., 2002). Each odorant was tested a single time under a different drug condition. The experimenter was blind to the identity of the test odors during performance of these experiments.The primary data, as depicted on figure ordinates, consisted of digging times during test trials. After ANOVA testing for differences in digging times among rats, using test odorant as a within-subject factor (differences of zero, one, two, or three carbons from cond) and drug condition as between subjects factor,  tests (Fisher's LSD test) were performed to determine whether digging times differed as a result of drug treatment for specific test trials and whether the digging time elicited by a test odorant was significantly different from that elicited by cond. All tests were two tailed, and \u03b1 was set to 0.05. Error bars depict SEs. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS statistical software.In these experiments, we investigated how cholinergic receptor activation modulates mitral cell odor responses and how this modulation is related to pairwise odor discrimination at the level of mitral cell odor representation. We first describe the effects on individual mitral cells. We then discuss how the population response (representation) to the odor series is modulated.We recorded a total of 110 mitral cells from 38 rats. The majority of mitral cells recorded in our study exhibited significant responses to at least one of the four odors used (71 mitral cells or 65%). Of the 71 cells that responded significantly to odorants, 45 mitral cells (66%) always exhibited excitatory responses, whereas 26 mitral cells (38%) exhibited a combination of excitatory and inhibitory responses. Of the 71 cells, 26 mitral cells (38%) responded to only one ester odor, 7 mitral cells (12%) responded to two ester odors, 16 mitral cells (24%) responded to three ester odors, and 23 mitral cells (34%) responded to all four ester odors. Figure 1 shows a raw recording trace., Examples of single-trial responses of a select mitral cell to each of the four odorants under saline conditions. , Comparison of spontaneous activity between saline and drug conditions. Neo, Neostigmine; Scop, scopolamine.Although the frequency of baseline spontaneous activity can vary between mitral cells, neostigmine, MLA, and scopolamine were not found to modulate spontaneous activity of mitral cells when compared with saline control ((3,44) = 0.322;  > 0.05) (Fig. 1).Mitral cells were found to exhibit a variety of response changes after modulation of the cholinergic pathway. Neostigmine was typically found to increase the ability of mitral cells to exhibit differential responses to chemically similar odors as seen in the example in Figure 2. Figure 2 shows a mitral cells for which there was no significant difference between odors in either saline or neostigmine conditions.Effect of cholinergic modulation in odor responses. , , Examples of mitral cell odor response modulation by application of neostigmine. The graphs show the number of spikes evoked by odor stimulation (difference in the number of spikes recorded during 4 s after odor onset and 4 s before odor onset) in response to the four stimulation odorants (E2\u2013E5). , In this cell, there was no statistical response difference between the four odors ((3,16) = 0.34;  > 0.05) in saline. However, in the same cell after infusion of neostigmine, there was sharpening of the ORF after exposure to the same four odors ((3,16) = 3.7;  < 0.05).  analysis shows significant differences between E3/E4 ( < 0.01) and E3/E5 ( < 0.05).  shows a mitral cell for which there was no significant difference between odors in either saline or neostigmine conditions (saline, (3,16) = 0.012,  > 0.05; neostigmine, (3,16) = 0.049,  > 0.05). , Number of individual mitral cells exhibiting significantly different responses to odorants differing by one carbon under the control and drug conditions. * < 0.05, significant difference between saline and drug conditions. , Proportion of cells responding with significant excitation () or inhibition () to the odor chemically most similar to the \u201cbest odor\u201d of the cell under saline and neostigmine conditions. * < 0.05, significant difference between saline and neostigmine conditions. , Comparison of population responses to pairs of odorants as a function of drug treatment. The graph shows the average correlation between mitral cell responses to odorants differing by one, two, or three carbons. * < 0.05, significant reduction in correlation between odor pairs differing by one carbon under neostigmine conditions. Neo, Neostigmine; Scop, scopolamine.Overall, neostigmine was found to sharpen mitral cell ORFs: in the presence of neostigmine, 61% of cells ((Total) = 36) exhibited significant response differences between odors differing by a single carbon compared with 30% of cells in saline conditions ((Total) = 71) [Fig. 2; control saline data were all pooled together for data analysis because there was no difference in any of the saline runs (data not shown)]. Neostigmine-dependent sharpening of ORFs was attenuated by the presence of the nicotinic antagonist MLA and to a lesser degree by the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine (Fig. 2). Statistical comparisons of the number of cells that exhibited significant response differences between odors differing by a single carbon showed a significant effect of drug (ANOVA; (5,161) = 2.4;  < 0.05).  analysis showed that, in the presence of neostigmine ( = 36) alone, the percentage of mitral cells that exhibited significant response differences between the nearest neighbor odor pairs was significantly greater than that measured in saline ( = 71) or neostigmine/MLA ( = 32) conditions ( < 0.05). Interestingly, there was no significant difference between neostigmine and neostigmine/scopolamine ( = 17) conditions ( > 0.05). Addition of MLA ( = 7) or scopolamine ( = 4) alone did not significantly alter the response differences to these odor pairs ( > 0.05). The proportion of cells that showed a significant increase in firing in response to the odor chemically most similar to the \u201cbest odor\u201d was significantly reduced under neostigmine, whereas the proportion of cells that were significantly inhibited by this odor was significantly increased ( < 0.05) (Fig. 2). This comparison with the best response clearly shows that, overall, response profiles are sharpened by neostigmine.Statistical comparisons for the effects of drugs on the ability of the cells to fire differentially in response to odors differing by two carbons or three carbons did not show a significant drug effect (two carbon difference: (5,161) = 1.6,  > 0.05; three carbon difference: (5,161) = 0.59,  > 0.05), showing that the experimental manipulation of cholinergic actions performed here modulated the discrimination of chemically very similar (i.e., differing by one carbon) odors only.To further illustrate the enhanced discrimination between chemically similar odorants by mitral cell spiking responses, we calculated the correlation between mitral cell responses to pairs of odorants differing by one, two, or three carbons. If mitral cells respond similarly to a pair of odorants, the correlation should approach one, and, as their responses differ more, the response correlations take on smaller values. Figure 2 shows the average correlations between responses to pairs of odorants differing by one, two, and three carbons for saline and neostigmine conditions. Note the significant reduction in correlation ( < 0.01,  test) under neostigmine, indicating that infusion of neostigmine reduces the similarity in mitral cell responses to these pairs of odorants.In summary, increasing cholinergic modulation in the OB by local infusion of neostigmine significantly increased the proportion of mitral cells firing differentially in response to chemically very similar odorants. The observed increase was significant only when odors differing by a single carbon were compared. The neostigmine-induced increase was significantly reduced by the addition of the nicotinic antagonist MLA as well as the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine.In these experiments, to understand the effect of mitral cell response modulation on odor perception, we tested the effects of increasing and decreasing cholinergic receptor activation on the discrimination of series of aliphatic odorants differing by increasing number of carbons. Two behavioral tasks were used: a habituation task in which memory formation is non-associative and a reinforced task in which memory formation is in association with a food reward. Both tasks use a single conditioning odor and allow to test the specificity of the formed memory by comparing the response to the conditioned odor with that to novel test odorants.In this experiment, rats are initially habituated to a habituation odorant, after which their investigation response to the habituated and chemically similar test odorants (test1\u20133, differing by one, two, or three carbons from hab), presented in randomized order, is recorded (Fig. 3). This task enables measurement of short-term olfactory memory (i.e., the recognition of the habituation odor over the course of repeated trials) as well as the degree of spontaneous discrimination between chemically similar odorants (i.e., the recognition of a novel test odorant as being different from the habituate odorant).Behavioral experiments. , Habituation/spontaneous discrimination. Average investigation time during randomized test trials for all drug conditions. * < 0.05, significant difference between a response to a test odor and response to the last habituation trial (habituated odor). , Generalization learning, strength, and specificity of association. The graph shows the average digging times in response to the conditioned and test odors for all drug conditions. * < 0.05, significant difference compared with saline controls.No significant effect of drug treatment on investigation time during habituation trials was measured ((3,132) = 1.265;  > 0.2); however, a significant effect of trial number ((3,132) = 13.459;  < 0.001), without a significant interaction between drug and trial number ((9,132) = 1.408;  > 0.1), indicated that all groups of rats decreased their response to repeated odor presentations.  tests (Fisher's LSD test) showed a significant effect of trial number in all drug groups ( < 0.01 in all cases), and all rats responded significantly less during the fourth trial compared with the first trial ( < 0.05 in all cases).Comparison of investigation responses during the last presentation of the habituated (hab) and test odors (test1\u20133) during the randomized test trials yielded a significant effect of drug treatment ((3,112) = 3.757;  < 0.02) as well as a significant effect of odor ((3,112) = 11.057;  < 0.001). Pairwise comparisons of investigation responses in each group showed, as predicted from previous experiments, that saline-treated control rats discriminated between odors differing by two or three carbons but not between odors differing by one carbon. Rats in which cholinergic modulation was enhanced (in the presence of neostigmine) were able to discriminate between the habituated odor and all three test odors, showing that enhanced cholinergic inputs facilitate the discrimination of odorants differing by a single carbon. In contrast, rats in which nicotinic receptors were blocked discriminated only the most dissimilar odor from the habituated odor (Otest3, three-carbon difference), as did rats treated with the muscarinic receptor blocker scopolamine. Table 2 summarizes the results by indicating drug conditions under which a significant effect of test odor was observed and which odor pairs were discriminated under each condition. Figure 3 shows the average investigation responses during the last habituation trial and all test trials for all drug conditions.In summary, compared with saline control, increased activation of cholinergic receptors increased odor discrimination, whereas blockade of muscarinic or nicotinic receptors decreased odor discrimination (Fig. 3, Table 2).In this experiment, rats were first conditioned to associate a given odorant (cond) with a food reward (Fig. 3). The strength and specificity of the formed association was then tested during non-rewarded test trials with the conditioned odor (cond) as well as with several chemically similar test odorants (test1\u20133). ANOVA using digging time during non-rewarded test trials as variable showed no effect of treatment group ((3,267) = 0.845;  > 0.5) but an effect of test odor ((3,267) = 150.816;  < 0.001) as well as significant interaction between these two effects ((9,267) = 2.335;  < 0.02), thus indicating that differences in relative digging times may be attributed to cholinergic modulation.Additional statistical testing showed that a significant effect of treatment group on digging times was not found for the conditioned odor ((3,66) = 1.630;  > 0.1), indicating that the response to the conditioned odor (i.e., strength of odor\u2013reward association) was not affected by the drug treatment. A significant effect of treatment group was found among the responses to test odors test1 (one-carbon difference; (3,64) = 3.117;  < 0.05) and test2 (two-carbon difference; (3,71) = 3.298;  < 0.05) but not test3 (three-carbon difference; (3,66) = 2.230;  > 0.05). Specifically, rats treated with the nicotinic antagonist MLA responded significantly more to test odors differing by one or two carbons from the conditioned odor, showing that these rats discriminated less between these odor pairs (Fig. 3).In summary, these results show that blockade of bulbar nicotinic receptors decreased discrimination between the conditioned odor and chemically similar odorants differing by one or two carbons (Fig. 3).To compare electrophysiological and behavioral results, we plotted the population ORFs, i.e., the average response of all recorded mitral cells, normalized by the best response of each mitral cell, as a function of the difference in carbon chain length between the best response odor and the other odor stimuli. Hence, the graph allows us to visualize how the response of mitral cells changes as a function of carbon chain length difference between the odorant that evokes the best or strongest response in a given cell and subsequent odorants differing by one, two, and three carbons (Fig. 4). The graph depicts the population ORF under saline control and neostigmine conditions, showing that neostigmine significantly enhances the difference between odorants differing by a single carbon ( < 0.05, denoted by *). Spontaneous discrimination, graphed as the percentage habituation of test odorants (with respect to the habituation odorant), is shown as a function of difference in carbon chain length between the habituated and test odorant (Fig. 4). The graph shows that spontaneous discrimination is enhanced between odorants differing by a single carbon under neostigmine conditions ( < 0.05, denoted by *). Similarly, discrimination between odorants differing by a single carbon after odor reward conditioning is enhanced under neostigmine conditions, albeit to a lesser degree (Fig. 4). The graph shows the percentage of conditioned response to a test odorant with respect to the conditioned odor as a function of the difference between conditioned and test odor under saline and neostigmine conditions; the difference observed between saline and neostigmine conditions is denoted with an asterisk.Comparison between electrophysiological and behavioral results. , Average normalized olfactory response functions of recorded mitral cells. All responses are shown as the percentage of the best odor response and arranged as a function of carbon chain length difference to the best response odor.

The graph shows the percentage of habituation to an odorant with respect to the habituated odorant (difference in carbon chain length 0, at 100%). A decrease in habituation signifies an increase in discrimination in this experiment. Note the difference in discrimination between odorants differing by a single carbon between saline and neostigmine conditions (indicated by * < 0.05). , Discrimination after associative conditioning. The graph shows the percentage of conditioning (100% being the response to the conditioned odor) as a function of the chain length difference between the conditioned and the test odor. Note the increase in discrimination between odors differing by a single carbon attributable to neostigmine (indicated by * < 0.05).These graphs clearly illustrate the predictive relationship between cholinergic modulation of neural and behavioral responses.The present experiments show a correspondence between the modulation of mitral cell odor responses and behavioral odor discrimination by activation of cholinergic receptors in the olfactory bulb. Activation of cholinergic receptors in the olfactory bulb significantly increased the number of mitral cells responding differentially to pairs of aliphatic odorants differing by a single carbon in their chain as well as behavioral discrimination between these odorant pairs. Cholinergic pathways have traditionally been associated with attentional mechanisms: in the present framework, increased cholinergic activity enhances perceptual discrimination by changing neural stimulus representations, a phenomenon that can be interpreted as increased attention.The organization of the olfactory system is such that spatially distributed olfactory sensory neurons, expressing common olfactory receptors, converge unto one or a few common glomeruli. Localization of mitral cells that respond to families of odorants are shown to be distributed in particular regions of the OB (Johnson et al., 1999; Mori et al., 1999). For example, mitral cells in particular regions of anesthetized rabbit OB were found to preferentially respond, by increase or decrease in spike frequency, to unbranched aliphatic aldehydes of specific number of carbon chain length (Imamura et al., 1992; Yokoi et al., 1995). In general, odorants with similar carbon chain lengths will activate overlapping populations of glomeruli and mitral cells more so than odorants with dissimilar carbon chain lengths (Imamura et al., 1992; Meister and Bonhoeffer, 2001; Johnson et al., 2004; Farahbod et al., 2006). Mitral cells responding to these odorants are often sparsely and widely distributed across the corresponding olfactory bulb area (Davison and Katz, 2007; Fantana et al., 2008). Mitral cells interact with each other via local interneurons, many of which are the targets of central and neuromodulatory inputs (for review, see Shipley and Ennis, 1996), enabling the modulation of odor representations by these central and neuromodulatory inputs.The OB receives strong cholinergic inputs from the basal forebrain via the nucleus of the HDB that innervates primarily glomerular and granule cell layers of the bulb (Heimer et al., 1990; Kasa et al., 1995). Activation of cholinergic receptors in the OB acts on both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors (Castillo et al., 1999; Ghatpande et al., 2006; Pressler et al., 2007); these are well segregated with a low degree of overlap, whereby nicotinic receptors are typically located within the glomerular and mitral cell layer, whereas muscarinic receptors predominate the plexiform and granule cell layers. Cholinergic neuromodulation in the MOB, including both nicotinic and muscarinic components, has been hypothesized previously to regulate the discrimination of similar odorants (for review, see Linster and Cleland, 2002). For example, intraperitoneal injections of physostigmine, an acetycholinesterase inhibitor, were found to enhance odor discrimination between extremely similar odorant stimuli in a rewarded forced-choice task (Doty et al., 1999), lesions of cholinergic inputs to the OB and cortex reduced the differentiation of chemically similar odorants (Linster et al., 2001a; Linster and Cleland, 2002), and direct infusion of cholinergic agents into the MOB modulated spontaneous discrimination of chemically similar odorants (Mandairon et al., 2006b). Our electrophysiological findings show that odor discrimination is enhanced at the level of mitral cell spiking responses when cholinergic receptors are activated during odor stimulation (Fig. 2). Our behavioral observation shows that enhancement of bulbar cholinergic modulation increases olfactory discrimination (Fig. 3). Blockade of both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors abolished the enhanced discrimination observed in mitral cells, suggesting that both receptor types participate in the modulation of mitral cell responses. Behavioral experiments support these results in that they show that blockade of both receptor types decreases spontaneous discrimination, more particularly the discrimination between aliphatic odorants differing by one or two carbons. In contrast, in a reward-conditioned task, blockade of muscarinic receptors did not affect odor discrimination, whereas blockade of nicotinic receptors did. Interestingly, a previous experiment from our group, using a more limited odor set and a different conditioned task, showed that addition of a muscarinic antagonist to a low dosage of a nicotinic antagonist, not effective by itself, decreased spontaneous discrimination between chemically similar odorants (Mandairon et al., 2006b). Given that the electrophysiologically measured effects on odor discrimination are weaker for muscarinic receptor blockade (no significant difference between neostigmine and scopolamine induced effects on the number of cells discriminating between chemically similar odorants), it may be that the role of muscarinic receptors is secondary to those of nicotinic receptors and can only be seen in the absence of reward-mediated motivation or when nicotinic action has been disturbed. Overall, the effects of cholinergic blockade were much larger when spontaneous, unmotivated discrimination was tested, supporting the idea that the activation of cholinergic receptors in the olfactory bulb shapes odor representations, in a manner that affects perception but not to the extent of preventing the learning of an odor\u2013reward association (Figs. 3, 4). However, potential benefits of increased cholinergic action in the MOB may not appear in the reward-motivated behavioral task because control rats do not significantly confuse the conditioned and test odorants. These data are supported by previous experiments showing that pairs of odorants not spontaneously discriminated by rats can be rendered discriminable by reward-driven learning as well as by daily exposure to odorants (Linster et al., 2002; Mandairon et al., 2006a). Reward-driven odor learning may be accompanied by changes in odor representations at multiple levels of the olfactory system and activate plasticity mechanisms other than cholinergic modulation. Global interruption of cholinergic modulation, by either systemic injections or specific lesions of cholinergic neurons, have been shown previously to affect reward-driven learning (Doty et al., 1999; De Rosa et al., 2001; Linster et al., 2001a), suggesting that cholinergic inputs to the olfactory bulb proper, modulated in the present experiments, may underlie different functionalities than those acting on other olfactory centers. More specifically, cholinergic modulation in the OB would specifically modulate odor representations, whereas cholinergic modulation in olfactory cortical areas have been shown to modulate synaptic plasticity and odor reward learning (for review, see Linster and Hasselmo, 2001).Brain-slice experiments have shown that activation of nicotinic receptors both directly depolarizes mitral cells while simultaneously increasing their inhibition by periglomerular cells (Castillo et al., 1999). A recent computational model showed that these two phenomena can act together to increase the sparseness of mitral cell odor responses and to increase the degree of discrimination between chemically similar odorants at this level of mitral cell spiking activity (Mandairon et al., 2006b). Periglomerular cells narrow the response curves of individual mitral cells locally without the need for local and later inhibition between glomeruli (Cleland and Sethupathy, 2006); hence, the cholinergic modulation of response profiles in this model is compatible with new data showing sparse and wide distribution of mitral cells responding to chemically similar odorants (Davison and Katz, 2007; Fantana and Meister, 2008). Activation of muscarinic receptors has been reported to inhibit the firing of granule cells while at the same time increasing the degree of activity-dependent GABA transmitter release onto mitral cell secondary dendrites (Castillo et al., 1999). In addition, recent papers showed that muscarinic receptor activation is highly dosage dependent and regulates the response reliability and noise of granule and mitral cells (Pressler et al., 2007) and that muscarinic ACh receptor activation modulates a subset of periglomerular cells (Pignatelli and Beluzzi, 2008) in the glomerular layer. The authors found that muscarinic ACh activation increased membrane hyperpolarization, via potassium channel activation, in dopaminergic periglomerular cells, leading to a decrease in spike activity in modulated cells. Together, the effects of muscarinic receptor activation could result in a more specific effect of inhibition mediated by strongly activated granule cells in regions of responsive mitral cells, acting to regularize and synchronize mitral cell firing in response to odorants, as suggested by several computational models of olfactory bulb function (Lagier et al., 2004; Bathellier et al., 2006; Gal\u00e1n et al., 2006; David et al., 2008). As a consequence, the synergistic result from nicotinic and muscarinic receptor activation is one of limiting mitral cell responsiveness to odorants by increasing inhibitory action at the glomerular tuft, narrowing the olfactory receptive field, while simultaneously delivering specific inhibition at the level of secondary dendrites, stabilizing this reduction of receptive fields as well as increasing response reliability and modulating synchrony (Linster and Gervais, 1996; Linster and Hasselmo, 1997; Linster et al., 1999).In summary, cholinergic modulation onto MOB circuitry appears to play a functional role in odor representations. We here show, using coordinated behavioral and electrophysiological experiments, that increasing ACh activity in the OB increases perceptual discrimination in rats and sharpens mitral cell ORFs, respectively.This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant 1R01DC009948-01 (Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience).

A critical aspect of recognizing these visual objects is to identify the borders between image regions that belong to different objects. However, the neural coding of border ownership in human visual cortex is largely unknown. In this study, we designed two simple but compelling stimuli in which a slight change of contextual information could induce a dramatic change of border ownership. Using functional MRI adaptation, we found that border ownership selectivity in V2 was robust and reliable across subjects, and it was largely dependent on attention. Our study provides the first human evidence that V2 is a critical area for the processing of border ownership and that this processing depends on the modulation from higher-level cortical areas.Border ownership is a term for the phenomenon that a visual border between two image regions is normally perceived to belong to only one of the regions. Border ownership assignment determines the figure\u2013ground organization in a visual image and it is a critical aspect of object recognition (Nakayama et al., 1989; Driver and Baylis, 1996). Primate electrophysiological studies (Zhou et al., 2000; Qiu and von der Heydt, 2005) have shown that neurons in the early visual cortex encode the side to which a border belongs. Human functional imaging studies (Kourtzi and Kanwisher, 2001; Andrews et al., 2002) have demonstrated that higher-level visual areas lateral occipital complex (LOC) and fusiform face area (FFA) are sensitive to a change of border ownership, but to date have provided no evidence regarding border ownership selectivity in human early visual cortex.We designed our stimuli (see Fig. 1) by modifying a bright/dark square-wave radial grating annulus. In the stimuli, either the bright or dark stripes (sectors of a disk) are slightly longer in the radial direction, both inward and outward. This provides contextual information that causes the borders between the bright and the dark stripes to appear to belong either to the bright stripes or the dark stripes, respectively. Although the image difference (the contextual information) between the two stimuli is very small, it dramatically changes the border ownership of locally identical edges along the edges of the stripes. With these two stimuli, we attempted to address three specific questions: (1) Are neurons in human early visual cortical areas selective for border ownership due to contextual modulation? (2) If so, is there any selectivity difference between the striate cortex (V1) and extrastriate cortical areas (e.g., V2)? (3) What is the role of attention in the processing of border ownership?Since the border ownership selective neurons, if any, are very likely to mix with each other below functional MRI (fMRI) spatial resolution, we used fMRI adaptation to overcome this difficulty. fMRI adaptation has been demonstrated to provide insight into the functional properties of subpopulations of neurons within an imaging voxel (Fang et al., 2005; Krekelberg et al., 2006). To address the third question, we used two distinct attentional tasks to examine how manipulating attention modulates the border ownership selectivity of early cortical areas. Subjects were asked to attend to either the stimulus or a fixation point.Four subjects (3 male and 1 female) participated in all the experiments. All of them were right-handed, reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and had no known neurological or visual disorders. Ages ranged from 26 to 36. They gave written, informed consent in accordance with procedures and protocols approved by the human subjects review committee of the University of Minnesota.The two stimuli (Fig. 1) used in the main experiment were generated by modifying a square-wave radial grating with 18 cycles per revolution and Michelson contrast of 0.8. The inner and outer radii of the grating were 1.21\u00b0 and 7.46\u00b0 respectively. In one stimulus, the bright stripes were slightly elongated in the radial direction both inward and outward by 0.35\u00b0. This provided contextual information that caused the borders between the bright and the dark stripes to appear to belong to the bright stripes. In the other stimulus, the dark stripes were elongated in the radial direction both inward and outward by 0.35\u00b0, which caused the borders to appear to belong to the dark stripes.Stimuli and designs. , Stimuli used in the main experiment. The interior part of the stimuli was locally identical across the two stimuli, but as a consequence of the difference in the contextual information, the borders between the bright and the dark stripes were perceived to belong to either the bright or the dark stripes. , Stimuli used in the control experiment. The image difference between the stimulus pair in the control experiment was the same as that in the main experiment, but the borders between the bright and the dark stripes do not have a clear ownership. , ROI definition. The checkered ring in the left panel was used to define ROIs in V1 and V2. The transparent gray ring in the right panel shows the size of the checkered ring relative to the stimulus in the main experiment. , Schematic description of the experimental procedure. The example here illustrates three trial types: same, different and blank.For the stimuli used in the control experiment (Fig. 1), the areas between 1.21\u00b0 and 3.69\u00b0 eccentricity and between 4.71\u00b0 and 7.46\u00b0 eccentricity were filled with a mean luminance of 120 cd/m2. The other parts were the same as those in the stimuli used in the main experiment. So the image difference between the stimulus pair in the control experiment was the same as that in the main experiment. The checkered ring stimulus (Fig. 1) used to define the regions of interest (ROI) in V1 and V2 had the same size as the rings in the stimuli used in the control experiment, with inner and outer radii of 3.69\u00b0 and 4.71\u00b0, respectively.The main experiment consisted of an attend-to-stimulus condition and an attend-to-fixation condition. Each 410 s adaptation scan (six in one session for the attend-to-stimulus condition and six in another session for the attend-to-fixation condition) consisted of 54 continuous trials and began with 30 s preadaptation (Fig. 1). There were three types of trials: same, different and blank trials. In the same and different trials, after a 4 s topping-up adaptation and 1 s blank interval, a test stimulus was presented for 1 s, followed by a 1 s blank interval. In the blank trials, a 4 s topping-up adaptation was followed by 3 s blank interval. One of the two stimuli in Figure 1 was used as adapting stimulus in three scans and the other was used in the other three scans. Both stimuli were used as test stimuli in all six scans. In the same trials, the adapting stimulus was the same as the test stimulus. In the different trials, the adapting stimulus was different from the test stimulus. Although the stimuli in the attend-to-stimulus condition and in the attend-to-fixation condition were the same, subjects performed different tasks. In the attend-to-stimulus condition, they were asked to passively view the adapting stimulus and to identify the test stimulus as one of the two stimuli as quickly as possible by pressing one of two buttons. In the attend-to-fixation condition, the subjects performed a very demanding fixation task in which they needed to press one of two buttons to indicate the 200 ms luminance change (increase or decrease) of the fixation point as quickly as possible. The luminance changes occurred randomly and approximately every 1\u20131.2 s across the whole scan. Subjects reported having little awareness of the peripheral stimulus while performing this task. For the control experiment, the experimental procedure was the same as that in the attend-to-stimulus condition except the stimuli (Fig. 1). To avoid retinal adaptation and the formation of afterimage, all the test and adapting stimuli rotated back and forth within a range of \u00b15\u00b0 at a speed of 2.5\u00b0/s.For all of these event-related experiments, there were a total of 18 \u00d7 6 trials, 108 for each type of trial. The order of the three types of trials (same, different and blank) was counterbalanced across 6 adaptation scans using M-sequences (Buracas and Boynton, 2002). These are pseudo-random sequences which have the advantage of being perfectly counterbalanced  trials back, so that each type of trial was preceded and followed equally often by all types of trials, including itself.Retinotopic visual areas were defined by a standard phase-encoded method developed by Sereno et al. (1995) and Engel et al. (1997), in which subjects viewed rotating wedge and expanding ring stimuli that create traveling waves of neural activity in visual cortex. A block-design scan was used to define the ROI in V1 and V2. The scan consisted of five 15 s stimulus blocks interleaved with five 15 s blank intervals. In a stimulus block, subjects passively viewed a 5 Hz counterphase-flickering checkered ring (Fig. 1).In the scanner, the stimuli were back-projected via a video projector (60 Hz) onto a translucent screen placed inside the scanner bore. Subjects viewed the stimuli through a mirror located above their eyes. The viewing distance was 92 cm. MRI data were collected using a 3T Siemens Trio scanner with an eight-channel phase-array coil. Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals were measured with an echo-planar imaging sequence (echo time: 30 ms, repetition time: 1000 ms, field of view: 22 \u00d7 22 cm2, matrix: 64 \u00d7 64, flip angle: 60, slice thickness: 3 mm, gap: 0 mm, number of slices: 14, slice orientation: axial). The fMRI slices covered the occipital lobe. A high-resolution 3D structural data set (3D MPRAGE; 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d71 mm3 resolution) was collected in the same session before the functional scans. All four subjects participated in four fMRI sessions for the retinotopic mapping, the attend-to-fixation condition, the attend-to-stimulus condition and the control experiment, respectively.The anatomical volume for each subject in the retinotopic mapping session was transformed into the anterior commissure\u2013posterior commissure space. The cortical surface was extracted and then inflated using BrainVoyager QX. Functional volumes in all the sessions for each subject were preprocessed which included 3D motion correction, linear trend removal, and high-pass (0.015 Hz) (Smith et al., 1999) filtering using BrainVoyager QX. The images were then aligned to the anatomical volume in the retinotopic mapping session and transformed into the AC\u2013PC space. The first 10 s of BOLD signals were discarded to minimize transient magnetic-saturation effects.A general linear model procedure was used for selecting ROIs. The ROIs in V1 and V2 were defined as areas that responded more strongly to the flickering ring than the blank interval ( < 10\u22124, Bonferroni corrected), and were confined by the V1/V2/V3 boundaries defined by the retinotopic mapping experiment. For three subjects, the fMRI slices covered their posterior intraparietal sulcus (pIPS). Part of this area could be activated by the flicking ring ( < 10\u22122) and served as a ROI outside the retinotopic areas.The event-related BOLD signals were calculated separately for each ROI in each subject and experiment, following the method used by Larsson et al. (2006) and Liu et al. (2007). For each fMRI scan, the time course of MR signal intensity was first extracted by averaging the data across all the voxels within the predefined ROI and then normalized by the mean intensity across the scan. Event-related averages were then performed for each of the three trial types (same, different and blank) by averaging 12 time points starting at the test stimulus. The average response to the blank trials was subtracted from the averages of the same and different trials to isolate the response to the test stimulus.The peak fMRI response to the test stimulus was used as a measure of the response amplitude. We also computed an adaptation index A to quantify how much the measured response changed after adaptation, relative to the overall response to the stimuli in each visual area. The index was calculated as follows: A=(different\u2212same)/(different+same), where different is the mean amplitude of the responses to the different test stimulus, and same is the mean amplitude of the responses to the same test stimulus. This index could range from \u22121 to 1 and was positive whenever the mean response to the different test stimulus was greater than the mean response to the same test stimulus. A large adaptation index of a ROI means a strong adaptation effect, with the implication of a large proportion of border ownership-selective neurons in that ROI.Eye movements were recorded at 60 Hz with an iView X RED eye tracker (SensoMotoric Instruments) in a psychophysics lab when subjects viewed the same stimuli as those in the magnet. Inspection of the eye movement data revealed that all subjects were able to maintain stable fixation throughout the experiment and most of their gaze positions were within 0.5\u00b0 radius of the fixation point.Behavioral data showed that the subjects strictly followed the instructions. In the attend-to-stimulus condition, their responses to the test stimuli were both accurate and fast. The correct rates for both the same and different trials were >97%. The reaction times (mean \u00b1 SEM) were 519 \u00b1 31 ms for the same trials and 517 \u00b1 33 ms for the different trials. In the attend-to-fixation condition, for the same trials and the different trials, the correct rates (mean \u00b1 SEM) of discriminating the luminance change were 77 \u00b1 3% and 75 \u00b1 3% respectively, and the reaction times (mean \u00b1 SEM) were 451 \u00b1 16 ms and 443 \u00b1 19 ms, respectively. For all these measurements, there was no significant difference between the two types of trials.fMRI signals were extracted from the ROIs in V1 and V2 and were selectively averaged according to the trial type. The peak fMRI response to the test stimulus was used as a measure of the response amplitude. We hypothesize that, if a cortical area contains neurons selective to border ownership, according to the fMRI adaptation logic, the area should show a higher response to the test stimulus that is different from the adapting stimulus (different trial) than to the test stimulus that is the same as the adapting stimulus (same trial).In the attended-to-fixation condition (Fig. 2), none of the four subjects showed a significant adaptation effect, a higher response in the different trial than in the same trial, in both V1 and V2. In the attend-to-stimulus condition (Fig. 2), the adaptation effect in V1 was weak and unreliable. Only one subject (S4) showed a significant adaptation effect ( = 3.165,  = 0.025). However, the adaptation effect in V2 was strong and consistent across all the four subjects (S1:  = 7.212,  < 0.001; S2:  = 2.679,  = 0.044; S3:  = 2.891,  = 0.034; S4:  = 5.095,  = 0.004). These results demonstrate that V2 is a critical area for the processing of border ownership and this processing is largely dependent on attention.fMRI results in the main experiment. , Attend-to-fixation condition. , Attend-to-stimulus condition.

Error bars denote 1 SEM calculated across scans for each subject.The adaptation index can be used for comparing border ownership selectivity between different cortical areas. A large index of a cortical area means a strong adaptation effect and suggests a large proportion of border ownership-selective neurons in this area (Larsson et al., 2006; Ashida et al., 2007; Fang et al., 2007). In the attend-to-stimulus condition, the adaptation index of V2 was significantly larger than that of V1 ( = 4.958,  = 0.016). The adaptation index of V1 was significantly larger than zero ( = 3.214,  = 0.049) although the V1 adaptation effect was not consistently exhibited at the individual subjects level. But in the attend-to-fixation conditions, the adaptation indices of both V1 and V2 were not significantly larger than zero (no adaptation effect), and there was no significant difference between V1 and V2 (Fig. 3). These results further suggest that V2 plays a more important role than V1 in border ownership processing.Adaptation indices of V1 and V2 averaged across four subjects in the attend-to-fixation condition and the attend-to-stimulus condition. Asterisks indicate a statistically significant difference between the adaptation indices of V1 and V2 (* < 0.05). Error bars denote 1 SEM calculated across subjects.It could be argued that the adaptation effect we found in V2 was due to the image difference (the contextual information itself) between the adapting stimulus and the test stimulus, rather than the perceived border ownership difference. In the main experiment, the separation between the ROI ring and the image regions that provide the contextual information was at least 2.5\u00b0 (Fig. 1), which is much larger than the classical receptive field sizes (0.5\u00b0 and 1.5\u00b0) of V1 and V2 neurons at the eccentricity of the ring (Smith et al., 2001). The human population receptive field size estimates (Dumoulin and Wandell, 2008) also agree well with the electrophysiological measurements. All the evidence suggests that the V1 and V2 neurons in the ROIs cannot respond directly to the distant contextual information and were presumably driven by locally identical stimuli.However, Cornelissen et al. (2006) argued that, within V1 and V2, the fMRI signal from one subregion could be enhanced by a visual stimulus that stimulated another remote subregion. Thus, the observed effect in the ROI in V2 could be an artifactual consequence of the contextual change, but not the border ownership adaptation. We performed the control experiment to rule out this potential confound. The stimuli used in the control experiment were modified from the stimuli in the main experiment. Only the image region providing the contextual information and an annular interior part of the radial grating having the same size as the ROI stimulus were kept. Thus, the image difference between the stimulus pair in the control experiment was the same as that in the main experiment. But the borders in the annular interior part of the radial grating did not have a clear ownership. The experimental procedure was the same as the attend-to-stimulus condition in the main experiment. We did not find any adaptation effect in either V1 or V2: there was no significant difference between same trials and different trials (Fig. 4).fMRI results in the control experiment. Left column shows the time courses of BOLD signals evoked by test stimuli that were presented at time point 0. The signals were averaged across four subjects in V1 and V2. Error bars denote 1 SEM calculated across subjects at each time point. Right column shows fMRI response amplitudes to test stimuli for individual subjects. Error bars denote 1 SEM calculated across scans for each subject.It is well known that spatial attention can strongly modulate fMRI signals in the visual cortex, as early as V1 (Tootell et al., 1998; Brefczynski and DeYoe, 1999). The observed fMRI signal difference between same trials and different trials in the main experiment could have reflected an attentional signal elicited by the change in the stimulus, rather than selective adaptation to border ownership. Although we found that border ownership adaptation was dependent on attention, we have several reasons to argue against that it is a pure attentional effect. First, there was no significant difference in the behavioral data (reaction time and correct rate) between same trials and different trials. More attention allocated to the test stimulus in the different trials could have presumably resulted in a better performance (Posner, 1980). Second, the image difference in the stimulus pair in the control experiment was the same as that in the main experiment. If the fMRI signal difference in the main experiment reflected an attentional signal elicited by the physical change of the stimulus, we should have observed a similar signal difference in the control experiment. But our data show that this is not the case. Third, for three subjects, fMRI slices covered their pIPS, one of the core regions of the dorsal attention network (Kastner and Ungerleider, 2000; Corbetta and Shulman, 2002), which is the putative source of attentional signals to visual cortex (Moore and Armstrong, 2003). Although the pIPS showed a robust response to the presentation of the same and different test stimuli, there was no difference between them, which suggested that no more attention was paid to or elicited by the different test stimulus than the same test stimulus.Previous human fMRI studies found that some higher-level visual areas, the LOC and FFA, were sensitive to a change of border ownership (Kourtzi and Kanwisher, 2001; Andrews et al., 2002). Baylis and Driver (2001) showed that the inferotermporal (IT) cortex of awake, behaving monkeys contains neurons that were selective to border ownership. Since monkey IT and human LOC and FFA are the brain areas critically involved in object and face recognition, the border ownership selectivity in these areas might be an epiphenomenon of the neural processes underlying object recognition. It is possible that earlier visual areas resolve border ownership and provide input to higher visual areas (Rubin, 2001). Zhou et al. (2000) reported that >50% of the neurons in monkey V2 showed a border ownership selectivity, which provides some tentative support for the early computation idea. In a human psychophysical study, von der Heydt et al. (2005) showed a border-ownership-dependent tilt aftereffect pointing to the existence of border-ownership selective neurons at early stages in the human visual cortex. Consistent with these studies, our fMRI study demonstrated the important role of V2 in mediating the processing of border ownership.We found that attention is critical for the neural selectivity of border ownership: when subjects did a very demanding fixation task, the border ownership adaptation effect was nearly abolished in their early visual cortex. Qiu et al. (2007) reported that, although the neuronal responses to border ownership in V2 were strongly modulated by attention, there were still some neurons whose selectivity to border ownership was independent of attention. This discrepancy could be attributed to many factors. In addition to the species difference (human vs monkey) and stimulus difference, one important factor is the attentional task difference. Subjects did the fixation task throughout an fMRI run (\u223c7 min) and they reported having little awareness of the border ownership assignment. It might be more proper to claim that border ownership assignment depends on visual awareness. In Qiu et al. (2007), the onset of a test stimulus could have recruited some bottom-up (exogenous) attention, although the stimulus was cued to be ignored. Another important factor is the measure difference (fMRI adaptation vs single-unit recording). Our claim that border ownership selectivity depends on attention is based on the finding of attention-dependent border ownership selective adaptation. It might be argued that border ownership signals do not depend on attention, but their adaptation does. Although we cannot completely rule out this possibility and it is true that some kind of adaptation requires attention (Yeh et al., 1996), it is widely accepted that selective adaptation originates from neuronal selectivity and many studies have demonstrated that they can be modulated similarly by attention (Murray and Wojciulik, 2004; Clifford and Rhodes, 2005).The attentional effect indicates that border ownership processing depends on the modulation from higher-level cortical areas. This modulation could be realized in two different ways. One way is that attention enhances V2 activity, and V2 by itself generates the border ownership signal through intracortical interactions, as suggested in a computational model by Zhaoping (2005). The other way is that, higher visual areas whose activity is largely dependent on attention, integrate contextual information, determine the border ownership and feed back to V2.In visual information processing, border ownership assignment is closely related to figure\u2013ground organization. Electrophysiological studies (Zipser et al., 1996; Lee et al., 1998) (but see Rossi et al., 2001) have found enhancement of texture-evoked activity in figure regions compared with the ground region in V1 neurons. In our study, the border ownership changes were accompanied by a change of figure\u2013ground organization. However, the weak and unreliable adaptation effect in V1 indicates that there was no robust sensitivity to the figure\u2013ground change. Zipser et al. (1996) and Lee et al. (1998) used line-textured figures that were centered on the receptive field. Thus, the enhancement in figure regions reflected the activity of neurons that are selective for the texture orientation, not the figure boundary. However, the figures and ground in our stimuli were objects of uniform color. Because it is known that most cortical neurons respond very little to uniform stimuli (Hubel and Wiesel, 1968), figure\u2013ground information in our study is likely coded only in the border responses. It remains to be examined whether the figure\u2013ground effect can be revealed in V1 by using line-textured stimuli and fMRI adaptation technique.Consistent with previous studies (Albright and Stoner, 2002), our results suggest that neurons in early visual cortex integrate the image context far beyond the classical receptive field, and add weight to the claim that high-level visual computations and representations involve neural activity in early visual cortex (Lee et al., 1998). Although it has been shown that fMRI signals in human early visual cortex can be modulated by contextual information (Zenger-Landolt and Heeger, 2003; Sasaki and Watanabe, 2004; Murray et al., 2006; Boyaci et al., 2007), we demonstrate a context-dependent fMRI adaptation effect that provides clear evidence of border ownership selectivity at a subvoxel level in human early visual cortex. Together with other evidence, the resolution of border ownership involves computations in early as well as high-level cortical areas. In future research, asking how these computations are done by inter- and intracortical cooperation will be of great importance to understand how human visual system parses images and recognizes objects.This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant EY015261 and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project 30870762).

However, the interrelationship between inflammation and NTFs is unknown. Recently, ethyl-eicosapentaenoate (EPA) has been used to treat depression. The mechanism by which EPA benefits depression is also unclear. Using the olfactory bulbectomized (OB) rat model of depression, this study evaluated two pathways from bulbectomy to the induction of depression-like changes (the inflammation\u2013hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis\u2013stress response pathway and inflammation\u2013nerve growth factor\u2013memory pathway) and the effect of EPA on these pathways. When compared with sham-operated rats fed a control diet, significantly increased locomotor and rearing activities in an \u201copen field,\u201d impaired memory in the Morris water maze, increased expression of corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), and increased secretion of corticosterone were found in OB rats. mRNA expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) was significantly lower in the hippocampus, and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) was higher in the hypothalamus; this change was associated with increased interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the serum and brain. EPA treatments normalized these behavioral impairments and reduced CRF expression and corticosterone secretion. EPA also reduced serum concentrations of IL-1\u03b2 and PGE2, but reversed NGF reduction. Similar to the effects of EPA, the anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib significantly reduced blood PGE2, IL-1\u03b2, and corticosterone concentrations and increased NGF expression in OB rats. Furthermore, anti-NGF treatment blocked EPA effects on behavior. These results suggest that an interaction exists between inflammation and NGF in the depression model. EPA may improve depression via its anti-inflammation properties and the upregulation of NGF.Inflammation may play an important role in major depression for multiple reasons. First, stress, as a trigger for depression, can increase inflammatory responses (Maes et al., 1998; Calcagni and Elenkov, 2006; Pace et al., 2007). Second, proinflammatory cytokines can stimulate the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis to release glucocorticoids through the phospholipase A2 (PLA2)\u2013prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)\u2013corticotropin-releasing factor pathway (Engblom et al., 2002; Song et al., 2007). Third, proinflammatory cytokines can activate indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, which may reduce the availability of the serotonin precursor tryptophan to the brain (Song et al., 1998; Wichers et al., 2005). Recently, a neurotrophin hypothesis of depression has been raised because (1) neurodegenerative symptoms occur in depression, which is associated with a decrease in blood or brain concentrations of neurotrophic factors (NTFs), (2) antidepressant treatments increase the expression of NTFs, (3) NTFs can protect noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons, and (4) glucocorticoids and inflammation may suppress NTF synthesis (Mamounas et al., 1995; Quintero et al., 2004; Dranovsky and Hen, 2006; Castr\u00e9n et al., 2007; Leonard, 2007; Post, 2007; Rajkowska and Miguel-Hidalgo, 2007; Schmidt and Duman, 2007). Decreased nerve growth factor (NGF) has been reported in several animal models of depression (Hellweg et al., 2002; von Richthofen et al., 2003; Schulte-Herbr\u00fcggen et al., 2006). However, the relationship between inflammation and NTFs in depression remains unknown.Increasing evidence suggests that omega (n)-3 fatty acids have antidepressant and neuroprotective effects (Peet and Stokes, 2005; Lynch et al., 2007). Decreased n-3 fatty acids but an increased n-6/n-3 ratio occurs in depressed patients (Maes et al., 1999). Blood concentrations of n-3 fatty acids may reflect n-3 fatty acid levels in the brain because n-3 fatty acids can cross the blood\u2013brain barrier (Edmond, 2001; Yehuda et al., 2005).The n-6 fatty acid arachidonic acid is a precursor of eicosanoids, which produce PGE2 and other inflammatory compounds through the action of PLA2. Increased cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) activity has been related to the dysfunction of neurotransmitter systems and the HPA axis in depressed patients (Hibbeln et al., 1989; Pae et al., 2004). In contrast, a high intake of n-3 fatty acids like eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) can inhibit inflammation. We have previously reported that EPA can significantly suppress stress and anxiety-like behavior as well as decrease corticosterone secretion induced by the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) (Song et al., 2003, 2004). However, the mechanism by which EPA improves depressive symptoms has not been fully elucidated.In the present study, olfactory bulbectomized (OB) rats, a valid depression model (Song and Leonard, 2005), were used to test two hypotheses: (1) inflammation may contribute to the stress-like response by increasing the activity of the HPA axis, and it may impair memory by decreasing the expression of NGF; and (2) the benefit of the n-3 fatty acid EPA to depression may be via anti-inflammation and NGF upregulation. To demonstrate these hypotheses, a COX2 inhibitor celecoxib and anti-NGF were costudied (see Fig. 1). If inflammation induces depression-like behavior, EPA might improve the behavior via its anti-inflammation properties. Thus, treatment with a COX-2 inhibitor should have similar effects as treatment with EPA. Second, if inflammation suppresses NGF expression, the COX2 inhibitor and EPA should attenuate NGF reduction. Finally, if NGF plays a role in the neurodegenerative symptoms of depression (e.g., memory impairment), EPA might improve memory by upregulating NGF, whereas anti-NGF may block EPA's effect on memory.There were four independent experiments (Exps.) in this study. In Exp. 1, 40 animals were divided into four groups ( = 10): (1) sham operated + 1% palm oil (control diet), (2) OB + 1% palm oil, (3) sham + 1% EPA, and (4) OB + 1% EPA. Palm oil and EPA were fed to animals for 7 weeks. Six weeks after diet feeding and 4 weeks after bulbectomy, animal behavior was tested in a novel and stressful environment \u201copen field\u201d and Morris water maze task, respectively. After behavioral tests, animals were allowed to rest for 1 d. Then, animals were decapitated, blood samples collected, and brains rapidly removed and dissected on ice. The concentrations of PGE2 and IL-1 were measured in the serum. The mRNA expression and activity of cPLA2 as well as the mRNA expression of NGF were measured in the hippocampus, amygdala, and hypothalamus. In Exp. 2, the groups and treatments were the same as those in Exp. 1. Corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) mRNA expression was measured by quantitative PCR in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus by a micropunch technique (Song et al., 2007). The level of corticosterone was assayed in the serum. In Exp. 3, 40 animals were divided into four groups ( = 10): (1) sham + saline, (2) OB + saline, (3) sham + celecoxib (5 mg/kg), and (4) OB + celecoxib (5 mg/kg in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, i.p.; Sigma) (Gobbo and O'Mara, 2004; M\u00fcller et al., 2006). After 4 weeks of treatment, serum concentrations of IL-1, PGE2, and corticosterone, NGF expression in the hippocampus, PGE2 concentrations in the hypothalamus, and animal behavior in the open field were evaluated. In Exp. 4, 30 animals were divided into three groups ( = 10): (1) OB + palm oil, (2) OB + EPA, and (3) OB + EPA + anti-NGF (Sigma). The feeding time for EPA was 7 weeks, and anti-NGF (12 \u03bcl) was intracerebroventricularly administrated for 10 d (Nabeshima et al., 1991; Nitta et al., 1996). Animal learning and memory were tested in the Morris water maze for 6 d. After decapitation, brains were quickly removed on ice and OB surgery checked for each experiment. Rats with incomplete bulbectomy or frontal cortex damage were excluded before analysis of the results.Male Sprague Dawley rats (200\u2013220 g and 2 months old at the start of the experiment) were purchased from Charles River. Food and water were available . The colony was maintained at 22 \u00b1 1\u00b0C with a 12 h light\u2013dark cycle (7:30 A.M. to 7:30 P.M.). Animals were handled daily. The research protocol was approved by the Animal Care Committees of the Universities of British Columbia and Prince Edward Island and conformed to the guidelines of the Canadian Council for Animal Care.One percent palm oil that contained a negligible amount of n-3 and low n-6 fatty acids was added to rat-chow powder as a control diet to ensure comparable texture and caloric value as the 1% EPA diet. Palm oil (Harlan Teklad Test Diet) was melted in a water bath (<50\u00b0C). The rat chow powder was mixed with the palm oil or EPA (Amarin Neuroscience/Laxdale). The food was prepared every 3\u20134 d and stored at 4\u00b0C (Song and Horrobin, 2004; Song et al., 2004). The feeding period was 7 weeks (Song et al., 2003). Before behavioral tests, rats were \u223c3.6 months old.Bilateral olfactory bulbectomy was performed under ketamine (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and xylazine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) anesthesia. The surgical procedure was the same as that described by van Riezen and Leonard (1990). In brief, a midline longitudinal incision was made from 1 cm posterior to and 1 cm anterior to the bregma. Burr holes, 2 mm in diameter, were then drilled through the skull 8 mm anterior to the bregma and 2 mm to either side of the midline. The olfactory bulbs were removed by suction, with care being taken to avoid damage to the frontal cortex. The burr holes were then filled with a hemostatic sponge. Tetracycline powder was applied to the wound. The skin was closed with 7.5 mm surgical clips. Sham-operated rats were treated in the same way, but the olfactory bulbs were not removed.In Exp. 3, rats were anesthetized with the same drugs. For intracerebroventricular anti-NGF administration, a 20 gauge guide cannula containing a removable 24 gauge obturator was stereotaxically implanted at the lateral cerebral ventricle as described by Song et al. (2003). The cannulas were secured to the skull with four screws and dental cement.The wall of the apparatus was made of aluminum and consisted of a white open circular floor. Faint brown grids were marked on the floor of the apparatus to divide it into 60 squares of 10 cm2 for quantifying locomotor activity. A 60 W bulb (white) was positioned 90 cm above the center of the apparatus. Rats were placed singly in the center of the apparatus. The number of squares crossed, rearing times (i.e., when a rat stood completely erect on its hind legs), grooming times (i.e., when a rat scratched its face with its forepaws), defecation, and the number of entries into the central zone of the apparatus were recorded for a period of 3 min (Gray and Lalljee, 1974). The apparatus was cleaned thoroughly with water after each animal had been tested.The apparatus and test for spatial learning and memory were the same as described by Song and Horrobin (2004). The water tank was 1.2 m deep and 2.0 m in diameter, and was divided into four quadrants of equal size (north, west, south, and east). The water depth was 80 cm, and a platform was situated 2 cm below the water level. Water temperature was held at 26 \u00b1 1\u00b0C. On day 0, rats were singly placed in a pool of water without the platform and allowed to swim freely for 1 min. On day 1, a platform was positioned in one of the quadrants of the maze. Each rat was put into the maze facing the wall at one of four starting directions over five trials. Animals were allowed to stay in the water for 60 s. Any rat that could not find the platform within 60 s was placed on the platform by the investigator and allowed to stay there for 15 s. On days 2 and 3, animals were trained with the same procedure as on day 1. On day 4, the platform was relocated to a different quadrant of the maze and the latency to locate the platform recorded. This training procedure was repeated on day 5. The swimming speed, path lengths, angles of swimming, and latency to find the hidden platform were recorded by a video camera and computer system and analyzed by a computer (hardware and software provided by HVS Image).mRNA expressions of NGF, CRF, and cPLA2 were studied in the hippocampus, amygdala, and hypothalamus by quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. The total RNA was purified from these brain regions using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized from 2 \u03bcg of total RNA using an Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen). Primer sequences were purchased from Invitrogen: for cPLA2, 5\u2032-TTAACCTGCCGTATCCCTTGA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-AATGGAGGGCTGTCACT-3\u2032; for NGF, 5\u2032-GAAACGGAGACTCCGTTCACC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GATTGTACCATGGGCCTGGA3\u2032; for CRF, 5\u2032-TGTGTCCCATACCCGCAAG-3\u2032 and TCGCCCTTTCGGACATCAT-3\u2032; for \u03b2-actin, 5\u2032-TGTGGATTGGTGGCTCTATCC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CGGACTCATCGTACTCCTGCT-3\u2032. The real-time PCR was performed with a QuantiTect SYBRGreen PCR Kit (Qiagen) at conditions of the initial activation at 95\u00b0C for 15 min, denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 15 s, annealing at 55\u00b0C for 20 s, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 15 s with a single fluorescence measurement for up to 45 cycles. Then, a melt step was provided with temperature ramps set from 40 to 95\u00b0C. The values were normalized against the endogenous control, \u03b2-actin. A sample from the control group was used as an external calibrator across all measurements.Serum samples from trunk blood of Exp. 2 were used for the corticosterone assay with a commercial radioimmunoassay kit (Immuchem corticosterone RIA kit for rats; catalog no. RCBK9906A; ICN Biochemical). Intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation were 6.8% and 5.6%, respectively.The serum concentration of IL-1\u03b2 was measured by the ELISA method according to the instructions with the kit, and the method was the same as that described by Song et al. (2004). The intra-assay CV values were 4.6.The concentrations of PGE2 in the serum and hypothalamus (the supernatant of homogenized and sonicated brain tissue) were measured by an enzyme immunoassay (Assay Designs). The assay method was the same as that described previously (Song et al., 1998, 2004). In brief, standards and samples (50 \u03bcl) were pipetted into the wells of plates coated with specific PGE2 antibodies and then incubated at 37\u00b0C. After washing away any unbound ligand, an enzyme-linked polyclonal antibody specific for PGE2 was added to the wells and incubated at 37\u00b0C. After removal of any unbound antibody-enzyme reagent, a substrate solution was added to the wells. The density of the color was proportional to the amount of protein bound. The intensity of the color was measured at a wavelength of 405 nm by a microtiter plate reader (Song et al., 1998).The hypothalamus was homogenized with a sonicator in ice-cold PBS. The protein concentration was determined in the homogenates with a Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol.The cPLA2 activity was measured with an assay kit (Cayman Chemicals) as described by Bosetti and Weerasinghe (2003). Briefly, 1.5 mm arachidonoyl thio-PC (1--hexadecyl-2-deoxy-2-thio--(arachidonoyl)-sn-glyceral-3-phosphorylcholine) in the kit was used as a synthetic substrate to detect PLA2 activity. Each sample was homogenized in 0.5 ml of ice-cold buffer 10 mm Tris buffer PH 7.8 (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 m NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 \u03bcm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 9.2 \u03bcm aprotinin, 0.11 \u03bcm leupeptin, and 10.2 \u03bcm pepstatin A). Cytosolic fractions were obtained by centrifuging at 18,000 \u00d7  for 15 min at 4\u00b0C (Rintala et al., 1999). cPLA2 activity was determined in the cytosolic fractions with the presence of the iPLA2-specific inhibitor bromoenol lactone (10 \u03bcm) and the sPLA2-specific inhibitor thioetheramide-PC (50 \u03bcm), which were incubated with the samples for 20 min at 25\u00b0C before the assay. According to the method of Ghelardoni et al. (2004), the assay was repeated and verified in the presence of 50 \u03bcmol/L cPLA2-specific inhibitor arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3) to confirm the reliability of this assay for cPLA2.A repeated two-way ANOVA (surgery \u00d7 diet) was applied to data from the water maze test, whereas a two-way ANOVA was used for analyzing other data from Exps. 1\u20133. A one-way ANOVA was used for the results from Exp. 4. Differences between groups were assessed by the Newman\u2013Keuls  test (the package was from GB-STAT, Dynamic Microsystems). Significance was set at  < 0.05. Results are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM.The order in which the results are presented here is the same as the order of the pathway shown in Figure 1.The relationship between bulbectomy-induced limbic lesions and depressive symptoms as well as a hypothesis for EPA treatment. Corts, corticosterone; NA, noradrenaline; 5-HT, serotonin.The two-way ANOVA indicated that OB surgery significantly changed the mRNA expression (\n(1,32) = 18.89,  < 0.001) and activity (\n(1,32) = 13.89,  < 0.001) of cPLA2 in the hypothalamus (Fig. 2) but not other brain regions (result not shown). EPA has a significant interaction with OB surgery (mRNA: \n(1,32) = 11.23,  < 0.01; concentration: \n(1,32) = 12.93,  < 0.01). The Newman\u2013Keuls  test showed that increases in the expression and concentration of PLA2 (expressed as the percentage of control) were found in the OB group fed palm oil (OB-palm) ( < 0.01) when compared with sham-operated rats fed the same diet (Sham-palm). These increases were significantly attenuated by EPA treatment ( < 0.01 for the mRNA and  < 0.05 for the concentration) (Fig. 2\n,).Effects of a diet enriched with EPA on OB-induced changes in the expression of mRNA (\n\n) and activity of cPLA2 (\n\n) in the hypothalamus. * < 0.01 versus sham-operated rats; #\n < 0.05, ##\n < 0.01 versus OB rats fed palm oil ( = 8\u201310).The two-way ANOVA indicated a significant effect of OB surgery on serum IL-1\u03b2 and PGE2 concentrations (IL-1: \n(1,32) = 7.96,  < 0.01; PGE2: \n(1,32) = 6.88,  < 0.01). The  test showed a significant increase in IL-1\u03b2 and PGE2 levels in the serum of the OB-palm group compared with the Sham-palm group ( < 0.01). The ANOVA also indicated an interaction between EPA treatment and OB surgery (IL-1: \n(1,32) = 6.62,  < 0.05; PGE2: \n(1,32) = 8.89,  < 0.01). The Newman\u2013Keuls test revealed that EPA treatment significantly reduced both concentrations of these proinflammatory mediators ( < 0.05 and  < 0.01, respectively) (Fig. 3\n,).Effects of a diet enriched with EPA and the COX2 inhibitor celecoxib on serum concentrations of IL-1 (\n\n, \n\n) and PGE2 (\n\n, \n\n) in OB and sham-operated rats, respectively. * < 0.01 versus sham-operated rats; #\n < 0.05, ##\n < 0.01 versus OB rats fed palm oil ( = 8\u201310).In Exp. 3, higher levels of serum IL-1\u03b2 and PGE2 were also found in the OB-palm group than the Sham-palm group ( < 0.05). Celecoxib treatment, similar to the effects of EPA, markedly reduced IL-1 and PGE2 concentrations in the serum of OB rats (IL-1: \n(1,32) = 5.93,  < 0.05; PGE2: \n(1,32) = 8.48,  < 0.01) (Fig. 3\n,). Similar results were found in the hypothalamus: the PGE2 concentration was higher in OB rats than in sham rats (\n(1,32) = 7.24,  < 0.01), and it was attenuated by celecoxib treatment (\n(1,32) = 9.43,  < 0.01). Sham: 1435 \u00b1 160; OB: 2376 \u00b1 260; celecoxib: 1026 \u00b1 121; OB with celecoxib: 1572 \u00b1 149 (results are expressed as ng/g brain tissue).The two-way ANOVA showed that OB surgery caused significant differences in CRF mRNA expression in the PVN of the hypothalamus and in serum concentration of corticosterone (CRF: \n(1,32) = 7.83,  < 0.01; corticosterone: \n(1,32) = 9.62,  < 0.01). The  test revealed that a significant increase in CRF expression and the serum concentration of corticosterone occurred in the OB-palm group ( < 0.01) compared with the Sham-palm group. Additionally, the ANOVA indicated an interaction between diet and OB surgery (CRF: \n(1,32) = 6.54,  < 0.05; corticosterone: \n(1,32) = 5.83,  < 0.05). The  test between groups confirmed that EPA treatment significantly reduced both CRF expression and corticosterone concentration compared with the OB-palm group ( < 0.05) (Fig. 4\n,). Celecoxib treatment significantly blocked the elevation of corticosterone levels in OB rats (\n(1,32) = 6.82,  < 0.05), which is similar to the effect of EPA (Fig. 4\n).Effects of a diet enriched with EPA and the COX2 inhibitor celecoxib on the mRNA expression of PVN CRF (\n\n) and serum concentrations of corticosterone (\n\n, \n\n) in OB and sham-operated rats, respectively. * < 0.05, ** < 0.01 versus sham-operated rats; #\n < 0.05 versus OB rats fed palm oil ( = 8\u201310).In Exp. 1, the diet and lesion-induced significant change in NGF mRNA expression was only found in the hippocampus (\n(1,24) = 15.84,  < 0.001), not in the hypothalamus or amygdala. The Newman\u2013Keuls  revealed that NGF expression was increased in sham animals fed EPA (Sham-EPA) when compared with the Sham-palm group ( < 0.01) (Fig. 5). However, a significant decrease in NGF expression was found in the OB-palm group when compared with the Sham-palm group ( < 0.01). A two-way ANOVA also indicated a significant interaction between OB and diet (\n(1,24) = 6.38,  < 0.05). The  test between groups showed that EPA treatment significantly reversed the reduction of NGF mRNA expression in OB animals ( < 0.05) (Fig. 5\n).Effects of a diet enriched with EPA (\n\n) and the COX2 inhibitor celecoxib (\n\n) on the mRNA expression of NGF in the hippocampus of OB and sham-operated rats. * < 0.05, ** < 0.01 versus sham-operated rats; #\n < 0.05 versus OB rats fed palm oil ( = 8\u201310).Exp. 3 further confirmed the reduction of NGF expression in the hippocampus of OB rats receiving a saline injection (\n(1,24) = 10.73,  < 0.01). The reduction was attenuated by chronic celecoxib treatment (\n(1,32) = 9.92,  < 0.01) (Fig. 5\n).In the \u201copen field,\u201d locomotor activity and rearing scores were significantly increased in the OB-palm group compared with the sham-palm group (locomotor: \n(1,32) = 14.73,  < 0.01; rearing: \n(1,32) = 8.08,  < 0.01). EPA treatment did not significantly change animal behavior in sham rats. However, OB-induced behavioral changes in the open field were significantly attenuated by EPA treatment (locomotor: \n(1,32) = 19.96;  < 0.001; rearing: \n(1,32) = 16.98,  < 0.01) (Table 1). Similar hyperactive behaviors were also found in the OB-palm group in the Exp. 3 (locomotor: \n(1,32) = 12.75,  < 0.01; rearing: \n(1,32) = 7.46,  < 0.05). Similar to EPA, celecoxib significantly attenuated both behavioral changes (locomotor: \n(1,32) = 10.83,  < 0.01; rearing: \n(1,32) = 9.85;  < 0.01) (Table 1).The effects of EPA and celecoxib on animal behavior in an \u2033open field\u2033In the water maze, there was no significant difference between sham and OB groups on days 1 and 2. On days 3, 4, and 5, members of the OB-palm group took longer to find the platform than sham controls (day 3: \n(1,32) = 22.26,  < 0.01; day 4: \n(1,32) = 9.43,  < 0.05; day 5: \n(1,32) = 13.65,  < 0.01) (Fig. 6\n). In the EPA feeding groups, there was no difference in the latency to find the platform between sham and OB animals. However, the ANOVA indicated a significant interaction between OB and EPA treatment on days 3, 4, and 5 (day 3: \n(1,32) = 5.06,  < 0.01; day 4: \n(1,32) = 3.35,  < 0.05; day 5: \n(1,32) = 6.21,  < 0.01). The  analysis revealed a significant difference between the OB-palm and OB-EPA groups ( < 0.05 or 0.01) (Fig. 6\n), suggesting that EPA markedly improved spatial memory in OB rats.Effects of a diet enriched with EPA (\n\n) and anti-NGF (\n\n) on spatial memory in the Morris water maze in OB and sham-operated rats. * < 0.05, ** < 0.01 versus sham-operated rats; #\n < 0.05 versus OB rats fed palm oil ( = 8\u201310).In Exp. 4, the one-way ANOVA indicated that EPA treatment significantly improved OB animal spatial memory in the water maze (\n(1,29) = 8.82,  < 0.01). In contrast, chronic anti-NGF administration significantly blocked the effect of EPA (\n(1,29) = 6.43,  < 0.05) (Fig. 6\n).It has been extensively reported that changes in the behavior, neurotransmission, neuroendocrine, and immune functions of OB rats are similar to those observed in depressed patients (Song and Leonard, 2005). Using this animal model of depression, the present study demonstrated two important pathways: (1) PLA2\u2013inflammation\u2013HPA activity\u2013behavior (stress response) and (2) inflammation\u2013NGF\u2013memory impairment. cPLA2 triggers inflammation by releasing arachidonic acid, a precursor of eicosanoids (Phillis and O'Regan, 2004; Rosenberger et al., 2004) that produce PGE2 and proinflammatory mediators. Both PGE2 and the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 can activate CRF-containing neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN) (Engblom et al., 2002), and they then signal through ACTH to release corticosterone. In the present study, increased expressions of cPLA2 and CRF and elevated blood concentrations of PLA2 and PGE2 were reported for the first time in OB rats. An increase in IL-1 levels was also found in the OB rat, which is consistent with previous findings (Connor et al., 2000; Myint et al., 2007). These inflammation-related changes were correlated with the increase in corticosterone secretion and stress-like behavior in the \u201copen field.\u201d Increased cPLA2 has also been reported in patients with major or bipolar depression (Noponen et al., 1993). Furthermore, the present study used the COX2 inhibitor celecoxib to demonstrate the pathway from inflammation to stress hormones and stress-like behavior. Thus, celecoxib significantly reduced both blood and brain PGE2 concentrations and decreased blood IL-1 levels. These changes were correlated with a decrease in corticosterone secretion and a decrease in stress-like behavior in OB rats. These results not only support a previous finding that celecoxib has therapeutic effects in major depression (M\u00fcller et al., 2006) but also reveal the possible mechanism by which the drug reduces stress hormone and stress-like behaviors by lowering inflammation.As mentioned in the introduction, the newest hypothesis of depression postulates that the deficiency of NTFs is causally related to the etiology of depression. A postmortem study in suicide victims has shown decreased NGF protein levels in the frontal cortex and hippocampus (Dwivedi et al., 2005). Decreased NTF expression is associated with neuronal atrophy and cell loss both in depressed patients and after chronic stress exposure, in which the excessive secretion of glucocorticoids or enhanced inflammatory response may play a significant role (Duman, 2005; Leonard and Myint, 2006). Indeed, chronic psychological stress, a common component of depression, enhances glucocorticoid release and suppresses NGF mRNA expression in the hippocampus (Alfonso et al., 2004). Furthermore, antidepressant treatments or electroconvulsive shock therapy increases the expression and concentrations of NGF in the brain (Alfonso et al., 2006; Hellweg et al., 2008). However, dexamethasone or corticosterone treatment has been also reported to increase NGF expression in the several brain regions, including the hippocampus (Shi et al., 1998). Nevertheless, the present study for the first time demonstrated the mechanism by which inflammation suppresses NGF expression in the OB depression model, because the anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib decreases corticosterone release but reverses the reduction of NGF expression.Previous studies by others also suggest that inflammation may suppress NTF function. For example, a study from an  model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) induced by aluminum has shown that increased proinflammatory cytokines are correlated with the decrease in NGF and BDNF expression; further, the latter triggers the expression of apoptosis genes (Johnson and Sharma, 2003). The molecular mechanism could involve the modulation of proinflammatory cytokines via AP-1, NF-\u03baB, and CREB signals, which change NGF and BDNF functions (Otten et al., 2000; Wong et al., 2005). Conversely, NGF has been shown to suppress inflammation (Stampachiacchiere and Aloe, 2005). NGF administration reduced the immunoreactivity of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-II (proinflammation) and enhanced MHC class-I (helping cell recovery) after spinal cord injury (Stampachiacchiere and Aloe, 2005). However, several studies have reported that inflammation or brain injury increases NGF expression and synthesis (DeKosky et al., 1996; Heese et al., 1998). These conflicting results may be reconciled by the fact that inflammation in the brain is a double-edged process that promotes homeostasis but also results in cell death through potential damage from inflammatory mediators. Recently, we have reported that acute intracerebroventricular IL-1 administration increases, whereas chronic IL-1 decreases, BDNF expression in the hippocampus (Song et al., 2008). In addition, neurotrophin receptors like the TrKs (which may promote cell survival) and P75 (which may trigger apoptosis) respond differently to the various neurotrophin changes induced by inflammation (Friedman, 2005).Another important finding from the present study is the series of mechanisms by which EPA ameliorates depression. n-3 and n-6 fatty acids are important components of the cell membrane. Changing the fatty acid content may influence brain structure and function. Epidemiological investigations have revealed a negative correlation between the intake of n-3 fatty acids and the onset or severity of depression (Cole et al., 2005; Parker et al., 2006). Several updated reviews have postulated that depression is causally connected with AD or dementia (Leonard and Myint, 2006; Fraise, 2007). Lower n-3 fatty acid concentrations were found in the blood or plasma of these patients (Maes et al., 1996; Connor and Connor, 2007). Thus, EPA has been used to treat depression (Peet, 2003; Nemets et al., 2006). In 11 clinical trials, eight investigations with pure EPA (1\u20132 g/d) showed significant effects and three trials with a combination of EPA and docosahexaenoic acid or with a high dose of EPA (4 g/d) failed. In the present study, we demonstrated that EPA can attenuate the stress-like response and improve memory in the OB model of depression. EPA may treat depression and improve memory via anti-inflammation (reduced PGE2 and IL-1\u03b2), anti-stress (reduce CRF and corticosterone), and neuroprotection (upregulated NGF and normalized neurotransmitters) mechanisms. The anti-inflammation effect of EPA was observed in the present study, in which it reduced both cPLA2 expression and the concentrations of IL-1 and PGE2. These results are consistent with our previous findings that EPA decreased cPLA2 activity as well as PGE2 and IL-1 concentrations in the brain and blood of animals receiving IL-1\u03b2 administration (Song et al., 2004, 2007). Because IL-1 and PGE2 can activate the HPA axis (Engblom et al., 2002), one of the mechanisms by which EPA reduces CRF and corticosterone may be through the suppression of IL-1 and PGE2.Inflammation and NTFs may play opposing roles in the cognitive impairment that often occurs in depressed patients. At physiological levels, IL-1 is an important factor for generating LTP and spatial memory. Suppressed LTP and impaired memory were observed in mice lacking the IL-1R or with IL-1RA overexpression (Avital et al., 2003). In contrast, the overproduction of IL-1 in aging and disease conditions (e.g., AD and depression) or the exogenous administration of IL-1\u03b2 suppresses LTP and impairs memory (Strijbos and Rothwell, 1995; Lynch, 1998; McGahon et al., 1999). IL-1 action on memory is probably mediated by cholinergic system (Song, 2009). Recently, Song et al. (2008) have reported that IL-1\u03b2 administration for 7 d reduces acetylcholine (ACh) release from the dentate gyrus during the memory retrieval phase, which is associated with memory impairment and lower mRNA expression of hippocampal NGF. After EPA treatment for 7 weeks, ACh release, NGF expression, and memory performance were normalized (Song, 2009). In the present study, reduced NGF expression in the hippocampus is associated with spatial memory deficits in OB rats. EPA increased NGF and also improved memory. After blocking EPA's effect via anti-NGF administration, animal memory showed deficits again. Thus, the present study demonstrated that decreased NGF expression in the hippocampus also contributed to memory deficits in OB rats, whereas the mechanism by which EPA improved memory might involve the upregulation of NGF expression.An increased inflammatory response may induce an imbalance between astrocyte and microglial activities and trigger the activation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and its subsequent enzyme kynurenine monooxygenase to cause serotonergic deficiency and glutamatergic overproduction (M\u00fcller and Schwarz, 2007). The dysfunction of astrocytes could also contribute to deficiencies of NGF and other NTFs. With regard to the glutamatergic system in cognitive degeneration and depression, Song's team has reported that IL-1\u03b2 cultured with hippocampal neurons selectively downregulates AMPA receptor phosphorylation and surface expression through extracellular calcium (Lai et al., 2006). High doses of IL-1 could also exacerbate glutamate-, AMPA-, and NMDA-induced neuronal death (Strijbos and Rothwell, 1995). On the other hand, an imbalance between glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission was found after IL-1 administration (Zhu et al., 2006). After EPA treatment, the reduction of glutamate-induced excitotoxicity and attenuation of age-related decreases in the GluR2 and NR2B glutamate receptors have been reported in the rat (Xiao and Li, 1999; Dyall et al., 2007). Therefore, possible mechanisms by which EPA improves spatial memory in OB rats may result from EPA's suppression of inflammation and normalization of the cholinergic and glutamatergic systems.A limitation of this study is a shortage of measurement of the fatty acid profile after EPA treatment. Many studies have demonstrated that n-3 and n-6 diets change the composition of brain lipids, and such changes have been firmly related to their effects on neurotransmission and behavior (Chalon et al., 1998; Yeh et al., 1999; Innis and de La Presa Owens, 2001).This work was supported by Amarin Neuroscience and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.

We used event-related fMRI to study dynamic changes in brain activity during both early and prolonged exposure to visual prisms. Participants performed a pointing task before, during, and after prism exposure. Measures of trial-by-trial pointing errors and corrections allowed parametric analyses of brain activity as a function of performance. We show that during the earliest phase of prism exposure, anterior intraparietal sulcus was primarily implicated in error detection, whereas parieto-occipital sulcus was implicated in error correction. Cerebellum activity showed progressive increases during prism exposure, in accordance with a key role for spatial realignment. This time course further suggests that the cerebellum might promote neural changes in superior temporal cortex, which was selectively activated during the later phase of prism exposure and could mediate the effects of prism adaptation on cognitive spatial representations.Sensorimotor plasticity can be induced experimentally in healthy subjects using optical prisms that produce a misalignment between the perceived location of visual and proprioceptive information. Under prisms, initial pointing movements are typically deviated toward the virtual (perceived) target position. These errors constitute the direct effect of prisms. Their correction is thought to depend on a short-latency \u201cstrategic\u201d process that is activated by deviations from intended plans (error feedback; Redding and Wallace, 1996). In general, terminal errors are successfully corrected after a series of 10\u201315 trials only. Behavioral research suggests that the terminal error on a given trial may be used to correct movement on the next trial (Rossetti et al., 1993). However, further pointing movements are necessary to obtain a sustained realignment of visual and proprioceptive spatial coordinates. This is a \u201ctrue\u201d adaptation (Weiner et al., 1983) that can be demonstrated by a compensatory shift opposite to the prism deviation when subjects are asked to point straight-ahead after removal of prisms (so-called after-effects) (Redding et al., 2005).The neural substrates underlying prism adaptation are of great importance to understand sensorimotor plasticity. Furthermore, improvement of spatial neglect after prism adaptation in stroke patients (Rossetti et al., 1998) and generalization of adaptation effects to other visuo-motor (Colent et al., 2000; Michel et al., 2003; Michel et al., 2007) or non-visuomotor tasks (Striemer et al., 2006) in healthy subjects have generated a major theoretical interest because they suggest that visuomotor adaptation might modulate higher-level processes involved in spatial cognition.A recent model (Pisella et al., 2006b) proposed that prism adaptation might critically depend on the cerebellum, in keeping with the lack of adaptation observed in patients with cerebellar lesions (Weiner et al., 1983; Pisella et al., 2005), whereas the subsequent cognitive effects might involve the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) via bottom-up signals generated by the cerebellum. An important role for PPC is also suggested by functional neuroimaging (Clower et al., 1996). In this pioneer study, PET scans were performed in healthy volunteers while prismatic deviation was reversed every five trials (left vs right), and revealed selective activation in PPC during pointing with prisms (vs without prisms), independent of the shift direction. However, because deviation was repeatedly changed, this study captured only the strategic short-term correction of visuo-motor errors before any sustained realignment of sensorimotor coordinates could be established. Another preliminary PET study on pointing with versus without prisms reported activation in the lateral cerebellum, plus ventrolateral thalamus and prefrontal cortex (Zeffiro, 1995). Sensori-motor plasticity has also been investigated using visuo-motor rotation paradigms (Inoue et al., 1997; Imamizu et al., 2000; Graydon et al., 2005; Seidler et al., 2006; Girgenrath et al., 2008), but the large magnitude of visual rotation (\u226590\u00b0) in these studies may involve high-level strategic control processes that are distinct from pure spatial realignment mechanisms concerned by prism displacement (Redding et al., 2005). Although one study (Diedrichsen et al., 2005) used a small rotation (25\u00b0, closer to prismatic shift), the direction was regularly reversed (clockwise or counterclockwise) so that the slow spatial realignment component of adaptation could not develop.Here we examine the neural bases of sustained prism exposure with the aims to capture both the early strategic component of prism adaptation and the more progressive realignment process. We used an event-related fMRI design allowing a dynamic investigation of neural activity over the time course of prism exposure and adaptation.We examined 14 healthy volunteers, 7 women and 7 men. Three subjects had to be excluded from the analyses because of technical problems during acquisition (two failed to correctly hear auditory instructions and behavioral responses of the third one were missing). All tested subjects (age range 19\u201328, mean 23) were right handed as assessed by the Edinburgh inventory (Oldfield, 1971). Eight of these subjects were right eye dominant and three left eye dominant as determined by standard methods. All participants had a normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders. They all gave informed consent according to the local ethical committee regulation.Our paradigm included all three classical phases of prism adaptation: (1) preexposure baseline; (2) active exposure to prismatic deviation over a prolonged period; (3) postexposure compensation or \u201cde-adaptation\u201d (Redding et al., 2005). Participants had to point to visual targets with their right hand, across four consecutive fMRI runs: either without prism (runs 1 and 4), or with prism (runs 2 and 3) that shifted their vision 10\u00b0 leftward (Fig. 1). Event-related fMRI responses were obtained for each pointing trial in each condition over the whole course of adaptation (see Experimental procedures). By comparing pointing during different runs, we could distinguish the different phases of prismatic adaptation, including short-term strategic corrections and \u201crealignment,\u201d as well as any activity related to the de-adaptation phase.Participants were installed in the MRI scanner with a particular set-up allowing a slight anterior flexion of the head position to allow a direct vision of the target display in front of the scanner bore, with a very strict, although comfortable, fixation of head and shoulders to prevent systematic pointing-related movements (see Fig. 1). Prismatic goggles were specifically made for this experiment using a point-to-point prismatic lens (Optiquepeter.com). The main advantage of these prisms, compared with Fresnel prisms, is the absence of any optical deformation of the environment perceived by the subject, which is thought to favor low-level sensori-motor spatial realignment (true adaptation) instead of higher-order strategic control. They were placed in front of the participant's eyes and attached to their forehead and to the headcoil. They were composed of a MRI compatible cardboard frame and two transparent glasses: one neutral (without any deviation) and one prismatic (producing a 10\u00b0 leftward shift of the visual wide-field). Position of the prism on the goggles was randomly assigned across participants (7 subjects had the prism over the right eye, 4 over the left eye). In addition, an opaque patch was put in front of the goggles' frame to allow monocular occlusion of either the right or left eye. This patch was controlled by a mechanical device such that it could be moved from one eye to the other during scanning without moving the goggles or the head. The patch was placed over the eye with the prism during runs 1 and 4 (i.e., neutral vision conditions), and over the nonprismatic neutral glass during runs 2 and 3 (i.e., prism exposure conditions).The experiment began with two brief training sessions of pointing without prisms, outside and inside the scanner. Then participants performed 4 fMRI runs (\u223c7 min for run 1 and 4 and \u223c6 min for run 2 and 3). Runs 1 and 4 (neutral vision) consisted of 4 blocks of pointing in alternation with 4 blocks of clicking.The pointing task required subjects to reach (with the tip of their right index) to one of two possible targets, located on the left or right side of a touch-sensitive display in front of the scanner bore. The targets were two red points horizontally aligned on either side of the display (\u223c10\u00b0 from center) and remained visible throughout the task. On each trial, the target to reach was indicated by an auditory command (the word \u201cleft\u201d or \u201cright\u201d) through earphones, in a random sequence (3 left, 3 right in each block). To ensure optimal adaptation, subjects were trained to make pointing movements as fast and accurately as possible in a single movement, with a starting hand position on their umbilicus, occluded from sight; and then to return to this position immediately after touching the target. In the clicking task, subjects were required to press (with their right index) on either the right or left button of a response-pad, fixed on their umbilicus. Instructions were identical to the pointing task, with the same auditory commands (\u201cleft\u201d or \u201cright\u201d) given by earphones in a random order (3 clicks on either side in each block).Each task was repeated four times in each of these runs (1 and 4), resulting in 24 pointing trials (12 to the left target, 12 to the right) and 24 clicking trials (12 on the left key, 12 on the right) per run. Runs 2 and 3 (prism exposure) consisted of 4 blocks of pointing trials, alternating with short rest periods without pointing. Pointing trials were exactly identical to the other runs (see above) except for the presence of the prism. Each block included 3 right and 3 left targets, in random order. At the end of prism exposure (run 3), two adaptation test trials were performed, in which the goggles were changed to the neutral position (with the patch over the prism), and subjects were instructed to look and then point to one of the visual targets with their eyes closed. These instructions were given by earphones, without interrupting fMRI acquisition, with the following sequence: \u201cLook at the left (or right) target; close your eyes; and now point.\u201d Participants made one pointing movement to the left target, and one to the right, in random order.Pointing accuracy was recorded on each trial by comparing the end-position of the movement relative to the target position on the visual display. The latter consisted of a touch-sensitive surface, made with a thin soft plastic board overlaying a PC keyboard adapted for MRI compatibility. Individual keys were not visible to avoid any visual cues other than the two color targets. Pointing errors were measured in terms of the distance between the keys touched at the end of the movement and the key corresponding to the correct target position. This error was subsequently transformed in visual angle, with a deviation of 1 key (2 cm) corresponding to \u223c2\u00b0 (given a distance between the subject's eyes and visual display of \u223c55 cm). A more precise spatial discrimination of errors was obtained by recording all keys simultaneously pressed by the subject, and by calculating the final end-position as the average key coordinates (which yielded a resolution of 0.5\u00b0 in the horizontal axis given the lateral shift of keys between rows). The size of terminal pointing errors allowed us to derive different behavioral indices for each pointing trial, used as independent predictor in our parametric analyses of fMRI data (see below). The error size index was determined as the absolute magnitude of terminal error on a given trial (i.e., with negative to positive values for leftward to rightward deviations, respectively). The error correction index was determined as the amplitude of pointing adjustment occurring between the preceding trial and the current trial (error correction on trial  = amplitude of the terminal error on trial  \u2212 1 minus the terminal error on trial ). Error correction was set to zero for the first trial of each pointing block given that no correction could occur in this case.MRI data were acquired in a 1.5-T whole-body INTERA system (Philips Medical Systems), using the standard head-coil configuration. For each participant, structural images were acquired with a 3-D-GRE T1-weighted sequence (FOV = 250 mm, TR/TE/Flip = 15 ms/5.0 ms/30\u00b0; matrix = 256 \u00d7 256, slice thickness = 1.25 mm) and functional images with a GRE EPI sequence (TR/TE/Flip = 2500 ms/40 ms/80\u00b0, FOV = 250 mm, matrix = 128 \u00d7 128). Each functional image comprised 30 contiguous 4.5 mm axial slices (2 \u00d7 2 mm in plane), oriented parallel to the inferior edge of the occipital and temporal lobes, and covering the whole brain from cerebellum to parietal cortex. For the main experiment, a total of 636 functional images were acquired in four scanning runs, each separated by a very brief pause, with an effective repetition time of 2.5 s.Images were processed and analyzed using SPM2 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience). All functional volumes were realigned to the first volume (Friston et al., 1995a), spatially normalized to a standard template with a resampled voxel size of 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 mm, and smoothed using a Gaussian Kernel with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 8 mm. To remove low-frequency drifts from the data, high-pass temporal filtering with a cutoff of 128 s was applied. Statistical analysis was performed using the general linear model (Friston et al., 1995b) for event-related designs as implemented in SPM2. In our main analysis, each pointing and clicking trial was modeled by convolving a \u03b4 function at the trial onset (i.e., auditory command) with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF). Error size and error correction measured on each pointing trial were included in the same design matrix as additional parametric regressors, also convolved with the HRF. Because these two regressors were effectively orthogonalized in SPM analysis, we could obtain a measure of their independent contribution to the neural responses on a trial-by-trial basis in each subject. The orthogonality between error and correction parameters was confirmed by computing the absolute cosine values of their angle for each participant: mean 0.0676 (SD = 0.0244) and 0.0778 (SD = 0.0406) for runs 2 and 3, respectively (values close to zero indicate orthogonality, whereas values close to 1 indicate colinearity), corresponding to nonsignificant correlation coefficients between these two parametric regressors ( < 1,  > 0.27 for both runs). In addition, residual effects of head motion were corrected by including the six estimated motion parameters for each subject as regressors of no interest in the design matrix.The general linear model was then used to generate parameter estimates of activity at each voxel, for each regressor and each participant. Contrasts images were calculated by applying appropriate linear contrasts to the parameters estimates for the regressors of each event. These contrast images were then entered into one-sample  tests across the 11 participants separately to perform random-effects group analyses. All statistical analyses were performed on a voxelwise basis across the whole brain. We report results at  < 0.001 uncorrected for multiple comparisons and cluster size >10. Location of activations in the cerebral cortex was determined on the average brain template of the 11 subjects, according to the stereotaxic coordinate system of the standard MNI template; location of activations in the brainstem and cerebellum was determined according to Schmahmann's atlas (Schmahmann et al., 1999).In a complementary SPM analysis, to estimate the time course of activity on a trial-by-trial basis, we modeled individual pointing trials during prism exposure (runs 2 and 3) as separate events in a new design-matrix, including again motion parameters of no interest, and then applied the general linear model to generate new parameter estimates of activity at each voxel, for each regressor and each participant. These parameters were pooled for left and right targets and averaged for pairs of successive trials to smooth the time course curves. Beta values (i.e., parameter estimates of neural activity corresponding to each regressor in the general linear model) obtained with this analysis were extracted and averaged from clusters of three specific regions-of-interest (ROIs) that were previously identified in our main SPM analysis (antIPS, POS, and cerebellum).Pointing accuracy was determined by the distance between the target and terminal location on the touch-pad. We compared the different pointing conditions by ANOVA on the mean terminal deviation using adaptation phase (runs 1\u20134) as factor. As can be seen in Figure 1, the main effect of phase was highly significant [(3,33) = 39.04;  < 0.0001], with Scheff\u00e9  tests showing a difference between run 2 and run 4 relative to run 1 (both  < 0.0002). There was no significant difference between run 3 and run 1, confirming that terminal position returned to baseline values (correct target location) during run 3.Experimental design and behavioral results. , Four successive fMRI runs were performed, either without prisms (run 1: before prism exposure; run 4: after prism exposure) or with prisms (run 2: early prism exposure; run 3: late prism exposure). In each run, participants pointed with the right hand to a right or left target (random order). Because the head was slightly bent forward, targets were seen in direct vision and not reflected in a mirror. In runs 1 and 4, pointing trials alternated with control blocks (clicking \u201cCl\u201d on a right or left button with the right hand). At the end of run 3, a measure of prisms after-effect was performed by asking the subject to look at a target without prism and point to its remembered position with eyes closed. AE, After-effect; Pt, pointing; Cl, clicking; L, left; R, right. , Set-up for the pointing task. Subjects tried to reach with the tip of their right index to one of two possible visual targets, located on the left or right side of a touch-sensitive display in the front of the scanner bore. On each trial, the target to reach was indicated by an auditory command (the word \u201cleft\u201d or \u201cright\u201d) through earphones. , Average end-position (visual angle) of each pointing trial during fMRI (for right and left targets plotted together). Positive values refer to a right deviation, and negative values refer to a left deviation. Pointing to targets with visual feedback (empty circles) showed a classical adaptation pattern. Before prism exposure (run 1), end position was accurate (baseline). Introducing the leftward prism (run 2) induced leftward deviations (direct effect). The course of error correction comprised an early stage (during run 2) with a rapid decrease of deviations, and a later stage with return to the baseline (run 3). At the end of prism exposure, adaptation was tested by pointing without visual feedback (filled circle) to targets (left or right) seen after a transient removal of the prism. This revealed a clear rightward compensatory shift for all subjects, confirming a successful sensorimotor adaptation. After removal of the prism (run 4), a compensatory rightward shift was observed, which was then progressively corrected.To assess the time course of error correction, we also performed trial-by-trial one-sample  tests comparing the average end-position of each pointing (left and right trials together) with the real position of the target (reaching the latter corresponding to zero deviation). This showed no significant deviation during run 1. During run 2, the maximum pointing deviation was observed on the first trial (mean deviation = 1.7\u00b0 to the left from the real target position). The end-position of the first 12 trials plus the 1eighth trial were significantly different from the real target position, whereas the last 6 trials of run 2 and all subsequent trials of run 3 were not different from the real target position. In run 4, the end-position was again significantly different from correct position for all trials except the last two, demonstrating a sustained compensatory effect after prism exposure.In addition, a direct measure of adaptation strength was obtained at the end of prism exposure by test trials performed without prism, but eyes closed (see Materials and Methods) (Fig. 1). These test trials confirmed a reliable sustained adaptation, with highly significant rightward shift (mean deviation = 2.5\u00b0 opposite to the optical deviation) between end-position and real target position (i.e., clear after-effects).We first identified brain regions implicated in the visual guidance of motor actions by contrasting all pointing trials made without prisms, relative to all clicking trials performed in the same runs (pointing run 1 + pointing run 4 > clicking run 1 + clicking run 4). Thus, any general cognitive processes activated by instructions, target selection, and/or motor decisions were canceled out in this contrast. This analysis identified a network of regions implicated in motor and proprioceptive control, including the contralateral primary motor cortex, overlapping with an area associated with elbow movements (Alkadhi et al., 2002); cerebellum (vermis and both hemispheres); bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA); and contralateral somatosensory cortex (Table 1). Activations were also observed in superior parietal regions implicated in visuo-motor action (Buneo and Andersen, 2006) including the posterior parieto-occipital sulcus (POS) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS). These regions were used to define a functional mask (at  < 0.05) of regions of interest (ROIs), specifically associated with visuo-motor control, which we could then test for changes during prism adaptation in subsequent analyses (see below).Brain regions activated by visuo-motor control (pointing > clicking)Brain regions recruited during the whole period of pointing under exposure to prismatic displacement were identified by contrasting all pointing trials in runs with prisms, relative to the first run without prism (i.e., [pointing runs 2 + 3] > [pointing run 1] \u00d72). This revealed selective activation in both the right and left superior temporal gyrus (STG) extending to the posterior-superior temporal sulci (STS) (Table 2, Fig. 2). When using an inclusive mask of ROIs previously defined as specific to visuomotor actions (i.e., pointing > clicking, see above), no significant overlap was found with the activated loci in STG/STS. This result argues against a role of these areas for the direct visuo-motor command of pointing, but rather suggests a contribution to higher nonmotor function that can be modified by prism adaptation; see review in Michel (2006). Moreover, when comparing activation in these temporal areas across the two successive prism runs, both the left and right STG/STS showed a further increase for pointing during run 3 compared with run 2 (Fig. 2) ( >4.93,  < 0.001 for both sides). This result further supports the hypothesis that activation within the STG/STS is not directly associated with sensorimotor plasticity but rather reflects higher-order processes induced by prism adaptation.Brain regions activated during prism adaptationBrain areas activated by sustained exposure to prism deviation. , Activation in the left and right superior temporal cortex revealed by contrasting pointing during run 2 and run 3 (with prism) relative to pointing during run 1 (baseline, without prism), displayed on the average brain of the 11 subjects: , left sagittal section at  = \u221260; , right sagittal section at  = 58; , coronal section at  = \u221222; , horizontal section at  = 0. , Parameter estimates of activity (betas, mean \u00b1 SE) in the right STS/STG (, ,  = 58, \u221212, \u221212) for pointing trials across the four successive runs (\u00b1SE). A similar pattern was found in left STS/STG.To determine brain areas more specifically implicated during the early stage of prism exposure, we contrasted pointing trials performed during the second versus the third fMRI runs (pointing in run 2 > pointing in run 3, all executed in presence of the exact same prismatic displacement) (Fig. 1). This comparison identified a network of areas including the right cerebellum hemisphere (lobule 4 and 5), the right superior parietal lobule (SPL) extending to the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and the left posterior parietal cortex extending to IPS and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) (Table 2, Fig. 3). Among these regions, only activation in the right cerebellum overlapped with the ROI mask previously defined as specific to visuomotor actions (pointing > clicking), suggesting a role in both the visuo-motor control of pointing and the early exposure to prism deviation. Unlike STG/STS, none of these parietal and cerebellar regions showed any progressive increases in activation during pointing in run 3 relative to run 2, but a significant reduction instead., Brain areas activated by early adaptation to prisms and postprism de-adaptation. , , Activations in right and left parietal cortex revealed by contrasting pointing in the early versus late phase of adaptation (run 2 > run 3), displayed in red on a 3D brain template, showing a peak in left intraparietal sulcus extending to inferior parietal lobule (IPS/IPL, peak , ,  = \u221230, \u221268, 40) () and right intraparietal sulcus extending to superior parietal lobule (IPS/SPL, peak , ,  = 40, \u221254, 66) (). , Activation in right cerebellum [peak , ,  = 24, \u221238, \u221232, corresponding to lobule IV and V according to Schmahmann (1999)] revealed by the same contrast. Results are also displayed on the average brain of the 11 subjects with horizontal sections at  = 46 () and at  = \u221232 (). , Activation in the left parietal cortex was also found during the de-adaptation phase by contrasting pointing trials during run 4 (without prism but postprism exposure) relative to pointing during run 1 (baseline without prism), displayed in green (peak , ,  = \u221248, \u221258, 52).We corroborated these data by performing an additional parametric analysis based on the magnitude of terminal pointing errors, which progressively decreased over successive trials during prism exposure (runs 2 and 3). This analysis tested for any voxels across the whole brain in which event-related activity during pointing showed a linear parametric modulation as a function of deviation magnitude, therefore allowing us to identify regions in which activity covaried either positively or negatively with error magnitude on each individual trial (see Materials and Methods) (Table 2, Fig. 4). A significant positive correlation (i.e., voxels with activity increasing in proportion to the magnitude of deviation) across all successive trials under prism (runs 2 and 3) was found in the left anterior intraparietal sulcus (antIPS). Another activation was observed in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (, ,  = \u22122, 30, 22,  < 0.001, but with a cluster size below our threshold of 10 voxels). However, a significant negative correlation (i.e., voxels with activity decreasing in proportion to the magnitude of deviation) across all successive trials in runs 2 and 3 was found in the left parieto-occipital sulcus (POS). This cluster was located on the supero-anterior bank of the sulcus. When comparing these regions with the ROI mask previously defined by specific visuo-motor activity (pointing > clicking), only the left POS (negative covariation) showed a significant overlap, suggesting a direct role in visuo-motor control.Parametric modulation of activation in relation to pointing error size during prism exposure. , Areas showing increases proportional to error size were found in the left anterior IPS (antIPS, displayed in yellow on a 3D brain template, peak , ,  = \u221246, \u221254, 56). Conversely, areas showing activity inversely proportional to error size were found in the left parieto-occipital sulcus (POS, displayed in blue, peak , ,  = \u221216, \u221266, 40). , Mean estimates of parametric modulation for these two clusters (betas for parametric factors as computed by SPM regression analysis), demonstrating a greater effect of error size for activity in antIPS, but a greater effect of correction size (difference in error size between the preceding and current trials) for activity in POS. Both parameter were also greater during run 2 than run 3.Because the correlation between parietal activation and error size during adaptation might reflect neural processes engaged by either detection or correction of errors (both being greater during early than late stages of prism exposure), our parametric analysis also included an index of error correction, defined as the difference in error size on trial  relative to the preceding trial  \u2212 1 (see Materials and Methods), in addition to the absolute error size index used above. For both antIPS and POS clusters identified above, we compared the values of these two different parametric regressors, estimating the modulation of activity during pointing as a function of either error magnitude or correction magnitude on the current trial (as determined by separate parametric factors in a single SPM analysis). This comparison revealed that activity in left POS was primarily modulated by error correction on the current trial, more than by error size; whereas conversely, activity in left antIPS was modulated by error size more than by correction (Fig. 4). In other words, a modulation of POS by behavioral performance was better accounted for by error correction than by error size on a given trial; and conversely a modulation of antIPS by performance was better accounted for by error size than by error correction. ANOVA on the parametric estimates obtained for each modulation type (error size and correction) and each region confirmed a highly significant interaction between modulation type and region [(1,20) = 21.35;  < 0.001]. These data provide further evidence that the positive covariation of antIPS activity with pointing errors during prism exposure (Fig. 4) is related to the detection of deviation, whereas the negative covariation of POS with pointing errors is directly related to the correction of deviation.Given the dynamic nature of adaptation, we performed a separate analysis to calculate parameter estimates of cerebral activity on a trial-by-trial basis, and thus determine more precisely the time course of changes in specific regions of interest (ROIs). In this complementary analysis, individual pointing trials during prism exposure in runs 2 and 3 (averaged across pairs of left and right targets) were modeled by separate regressors in SPM (see Materials and Methods). Parameter estimates were then extracted for these successive trials from ROIs in the left antIPS and left POS (which were defined by our previous parametric analysis on error size), as well as in the right cerebellum (which was activated in the first run of prism exposure, see above). The time course of activation in these three regions is plotted in Figure 5, and shows differential activation across the successive trials performed during the first run of prism exposure (while error and correction of the error took place). During the first 12 trials, antIPS progressively decreased its activity and POS progressively increased activity, before both regions reached a relative plateau. Whereas activity in POS then remained relatively stable between trials 12\u201318, antIPS showed further fluctuations until trials 18\u201320 before declining more completely. The right cerebellum showed a more progressive increase over trials, reaching a later peak around trial 16, and then gradually decreased during the last 6 trials. The time course of these activations were parallel to the pattern of deviation and correction in pointing performance over the same trials, because the greatest improvement in accuracy took place from trial 1\u201312 and returned to a steady baseline performance after trial 18 (Fig. 5) (see Behavioral results).Time course of changes in behavioral and neural effects during early prism exposure. , Average pointing errors (in degrees of visual angle, mean \u00b1 SE) for successive trials after prism exposure (run 2). Data are pooled for left and right targets and averaged for pairs of consecutive trials. A first phase with rapid correction in the first 12 trials is followed by slower improvement, until returning to baseline performance in the last 6 trials. , Parameter estimates of activity for the same trials as calculated by a complementary event-related analysis in SPM using a trial-by-trial model (mean betas \u00b1 SE), extracted for left antIPS (), left POS (), and right cerebellum (). AntIPS showed rapid decrease of activity in the first 12 trials, followed by some fluctuations until reaching minimal activity in the last 6 trials. POS activity showed rapid increases in the first 9\u201310 trials and then reached a plateau. Right cerebellum showed more progressive increases until trial 16 and then rapidly decreased to reach minimal activity in the last 6 trials.Finally, we tested for brain regions involved in the de-adaptation process (after-effects), after removal of the prism after successful adaptation (Table 2). By contrasting pointing trials without prism in the last run relative to the first run (run 4 > run 1), we found selective increases in the left inferior parietal lobule extending to the antIPS, close to areas activated during early versus late phase of prism exposure (Fig. 3) as well as those showing a positive correlation with pointing errors in parametric analysis above (Fig. 4). This is consistent with the marked deviation errors observed behaviorally during initial pointing trials in the de-adaptation run (Fig. 3).Our study reveals for the first time the neural substrates of prism adaptation in healthy subjects, by tracking dynamic changes in behavior and brain activity over the course of both sustained prism exposure and de-adaptation. Several distinct areas were activated, reflecting specific processes involved in prism adaptation, from initial pointing errors to successful spatial realignment, as well as possible influences on spatial cognition.We should note that our paradigm implied an alternation of monocular vision across pointing conditions (one eye with prisms, runs 1 and 4; vs the other eye without prisms, runs 2 and 3). However, only one contrast (Prism > Neutral) was potentially affected by this bias, and the bilateral and symmetrical activation (in superior temporal cortex) revealed by this comparison is unlikely to be explained by monocular alternation.In posterior parietal cortex (PPC), the left parieto-occipital sulcus (POS) and left anterior intraparietal sulcus (antIPS) showed a distinct profile of activation suggesting separate roles during prism exposure. We found that activity in POS was related to both reaching and correction magnitude on the current trial. Thus, POS activity was low in the first prism trials (with large terminal errors), and then progressively increased until errors became reduced (\u223c10 trials). This region was already reported during reaching (Connolly et al., 2003; Medendorp et al., 2003) or visuo-motor tracking (Diedrichsen et al., 2005). Moreover, parieto-occipital lesions typically produce optic ataxia, an inability to point to visual targets in peripheral vision (Karnath and Perenin, 2005; Pisella et al., 2006a). Together, these data indicate that POS might be responsible for adjusting movement plans based on new visual inputs after displacement by prism, and thus underlie successful correction during the early phase of prism exposure. A neighboring region was also selectively activated in a delayed mental rotation task (Suchan et al., 2002). This result supports the hypothesis that POS may compute the correction for the next trial through a deliberate mental translation (Rossetti et al., 1993), and hence contribute to the strategic component of prism adaptation.In contrast, the left antIPS was activated in direct proportion to pointing deviation, as demonstrated by a positive parametric correlation between the trial-by-trial error size and activity in this region; whereas there was no correlation with the magnitude of correction on the current trial (unlike POS). These data suggest a crucial role for this region in the error detection process, consistent with a previous PET study reporting similar activation during a reaching task with jumping targets (Desmurget et al., 2001). Our results are also consistent with PET results showing a selective activation of IPL during pointing while prisms were reversed (left to right) every five trials (Clower et al., 1996). However, the latter design was likely to induce a state of continuous error production (similar to the early prism exposure and final de-adaptation phases of our study). Our new data suggest that this activation may not underlie true adaptation per se (i.e., realignment of visual-proprioceptive coordinates), but only the error detection process necessary for the initial strategic corrections. This interpretation is also compatible with a case study showing impairment in error correction during prism exposure, but preserved adaptation, after bilateral parietal lesion (Pisella et al., 2004).Finally, an activation in right intraparietal cortex was also observed during the early exposure phase, when comparing the first versus second runs of pointing with prisms. Given the major role of right PPC in visuo-spatial processing and attention (Mesulam, 1999), this finding may further argue for a visuo-spatial component in the initial error signal generated by prism exposure.Activation of lobules IV and V in the right cerebellum was also greater in the first run of prism exposure, relative to the second run, and overlapped with visuo-motor activity associated with pointing (relative to clicking). This is highly consistent with an implication of this region in visually directed movements (Stein, 1986; Bursztyn et al., 2006) and eye\u2013hand coordination (Miall et al., 2000). A similar activation was found in the late stage of a visual rotation tracking task (Imamizu et al., 2000), and attributed to the acquisition of a new internal model after visual perturbation. The cerebellum involvement in prism adaptation is further supported by lesion-studies in both monkey (Baizer et al., 1999) and man (Weiner et al., 1983; Martin et al., 1996; Pisella et al., 2005). Interestingly, our trial-by-trial analysis revealed that cerebellum activity increased progressively during the early phase of prism exposure, and remained high for a longer period than the initial rapid improvement in pointing accuracy.Although our trial-by-trial analysis is essentially descriptive and must be taken with caution because of inherent variability of fMRI signal, this dynamic profile in key regions of the cerebellum (and parietal cortex) shows a remarkable convergence between behavioral and neural data.We suggest that the cerebellum is particularly involved in the realignment process that is necessary to re-establish a correct spatial mapping among visuo-motor and sensorimotor coordinates systems, so as to adapt to the optical shift. This process, which may result in the acquisition of a new internal model, is slower than the initial (more strategic) error correction and requires more pointing movements to become established (Redding et al., 2005). The relatively prolonged increases in cerebellar activity during prism exposure (until a stable correction of pointing errors) seem consistent with a critical function providing bottom-up signals to cortical areas responsible for the cognitive effects of prism adaptation.Another major finding of our study was the selective and bilateral activation of the superior temporal sulcus (STS), extending into the superior temporal gyrus, associated with sustained prism exposure. STS increases arose only during the later stage, when pointing deviation was fully compensated and errors completely abolished. Such activity was further enhanced in the second relative to the first run with prisms, but unrelated to trial-by-trial adjustment of performance.This result suggests an important role for STS/STG in the slow realignment process and longer-lasting changes induced by prisms. Whereas a previous study of medial-temporal lobectomy patients showed preserved prism adaptation (Canavan et al., 1990), our results provide the first direct evidence for a major role of lateral temporal regions in long-term effects of prism adaptation that might underlie changes in spatial cognition. Studies in monkeys have shown that STS and posterior-superior temporal regions receive multimodal inputs and make important contributions to cross-modal integration (Bruce et al., 1981). Thus, STS/STG is ideally suited to link multiple sensorimotor signals in a common spatial register.These data provide new support for an implication of the superior temporal lobe in spatial cognition (Karnath et al., 2001), an issue that has been intensely debated in recent years (Halligan et al., 2003). Lesion data suggest that right temporal damage may be significantly more frequent in patients with left spatial neglect than in patients without neglect (Karnath et al., 2004), with a maximal lesion overlap being remarkably close to the right STS activation found in our study (, ,  = 64\u201324 8 vs 70\u201320 4, respectively). We therefore conclude that the progressive increase of STS activity during prism exposure might reflect changes in a cross-modal or supramodal system that could subserve the effects of prism adaptation on spatial cognition, although other target areas may potentially also contribute (Striemer et al., 2008).By identifying the neural networks underlying different components of prism adaptation and their dynamical time course, our results provide new insights on the mechanisms by which visuo-motor plasticity may interact with spatial cognition. Based on our results, we propose that the initial short-term strategic processes implicate error detection signals in anterior IPS and error correction plans in POS; whereas the slower realignment processes implicate the cerebellum at which different spatial maps for eye and hand sensorimotor coordinates can be integrated and realigned. In contrast, the more delayed activity observed within STS/STG could mediate the cognitive effects of prism adaptation. The latter activation might be modulated by sustained activity in the cerebellum. Hence, our results support the hypothesis that prism adaptation can modulate cortical areas implicated in spatial cognition through a bottom-up signal generated in the cerebellum (Rode et al., 2003; Pisella et al., 2006b), albeit a key role of temporal cortex was previously not suspected. Anatomical connections between the temporal cortex and the cerebellum remain poorly known but might participate to cognitive functions associated with cerebellum (Ramnani, 2006).How sensorimotor plasticity induced by prism exposure can improve spatial neglect remains largely unknown. Our results add new support to the hypothesis that such therapeutic effects may operate by recruiting or inhibiting intact cortical areas (Pisella et al., 2006b). Among these areas, the temporal cortex of the intact left hemisphere may be responsible for improving spatial output subsequent to prism adaptation. This hypothesis is consistent with a recent PET study in neglect patients (Luaut\u00e9 et al., 2006), in which changes in left temporal cortex were correlated with neglect improvement after prism adaptation. Furthermore, delayed activation in temporal areas, as observed here, may contribute to consolidate these new spatial representations and explain why the improvement of spatial neglect increased after a delay of 2 h after prism exposure (Rossetti et al., 1998).This work was supported by grants from Inserm and La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de M\u00e9decine Physique et de R\u00e9adaptation to J.L., and Swiss National Science Foundation to P.V.

Here we provide evidence that an \u03b14-subunit-containing GABAA receptor contributes to the consumption of low-to-moderate levels of alcohol. Using viral-mediated RNA interference (RNAi), we found that reduced expression of the \u03b14 subunit in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell of rats decreased their free consumption of and preference for alcohol. The time course for the reduced alcohol intake paralleled the time course of \u03b1 mRNA reductions achieved after viral-mediated RNAi for \u03b1. Furthermore, the reduction in drinking was region- and alcohol-specific: there was no effect of reductions in \u03b14 expression in the NAc core on alcohol intake, and reductions in \u03b14 expression in the NAc shell did not alter sucrose or water intake. These results indicate that the GABAA receptor \u03b14 subunit in the NAc shell mediates alcohol intake.The molecular site(s) of action that support the voluntary consumption of alcohol are not known, but a major contribution of GABAergic systems, especially the GABAA receptor (GABAAR), has long been postulated (Grobin et al., 1998; Chester and Cunningham, 2002; Koob, 2004; Lobo and Harris, 2008). Recently, there has been great interest in whether GABAARs might mediate the pharmacological effects of low-to-moderate (\u226430 mm) alcohol brain concentrations attained following the consumption of one or a few alcoholic drinks (cf. Lovinger and Homanics, 2007). GABAARs are pentamers assembled from a variety of subunits to form multiple isoforms that are likely to differ in their alcohol sensitivity. Notably, pharmacological actions of low-to-moderate concentrations of alcohol (1\u201330 mm) have been reported at the \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4 GABAAR isoform (Sundstrom-Poromaa et al., 2002; Wallner et al., 2003; Wei et al., 2004), and, hence, this receptor is a potential candidate for the mediation of the reinforcing effects of oral alcohol. These findings, obtained in heterologous expression systems or brain slices, are highly controversial (Borghese et al., 2006; Yamashita et al., 2006; Borghese and Harris, 2007; Lovinger and Homanics, 2007). Therefore, to assess the relevance of the potentially alcohol-sensitive \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4 GABAAR to alcohol's actions, we used viral-mediated RNAi, which allows for region-specific reductions of target gene mRNA levels in adult animals (Hommel et al., 2003; Lasek et al., 2007), to determine the effect of reductions in \u03b14 expression on oral alcohol intake . If the \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4 GABAAR is required for the pharmacological actions of alcohol that support alcohol intake, then reduction of the expression of the \u03b14 subunit should reduce alcohol intake.The nucleus accumbens (NAc) contributes to the rewarding and reinforcing effects of drugs including alcohol (Koob et al., 1998; McBride et al., 1999; Weiss and Porrino, 2002; Everitt and Robbins, 2005). Studies suggest that the GABAergic system in the NAc is an important mediator of alcohol self-administration. For example the GABA antagonists, SR-95531 (Hyyti\u00e4 and Koob, 1995) and bicuculline (Hodge et al., 1995), reduce operant alcohol self-administration following NAc microinfusion. Notably, both the mRNA and protein for the \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4 GABAAR subunits are detected in the NAc (Pirker et al., 2000; Schwarzer et al., 2001). Therefore we determined the effects of \u03b14 subunit reductions in the NAc on alcohol intake. Because the subregions of the NAc, the core and the shell, have somewhat distinct afferent and efferent projections and correspondingly distinct behavioral functions (Robbins and Everitt, 2002), their role in alcohol intake was examined separately.Two 21 nt small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences of the rat \u03b14 subunit (GenBank accession NM080587) were designed using the GenScript web-based program. Specificity of the siRNA sequences was verified by a BLAST search. The two siRNA sequence are as follows: siRNA1 (\u03b14-1), 5\u2032-AUAACAUGACAGCUCCAAAUA; siRNA2 (\u03b14-2), 5\u2032-UGAGUUUGCU-GCUGUCAACUA. A nonrelated 19 nt sequence (5\u2032-AUGAACGUGAA-UUGCUCAA) was used as a negative siRNA control. To employ viral delivery of double-stranded siRNA, the adenoviral shuttle vector pRNAT-H1.1 (GenScript Corporation) and the adenoviral vector Adeno-X (Clontech) were used. pRNAT-H1.1 is a vector for vector-based siRNA cloning with an H1 promoter to express short hairpin RNA (shRNA), and contains GFP under control of the CMV promoter. For each siRNA sequence, two complementary DNA oligos, containing sense and antisense siRNA sequences with a stem-loop structure, were synthesized, annealed, and ligated into HI and dIII sites of pRNAT-H1.1 vector following the vector cloning protocol. The pRNAT-shRNA recombinants were confirmed by sequencing before subcloning into the cloning sites of I-I and PI-I of Adeno-X vector.Preparation of adenoviruses, Ad-sh\u03b14-1, Ad-sh\u03b14-2, and Ad-NSS, was initiated by transfection of recombinant adenoviral constructs into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Recombinant viruses were amplified in HEK293 cells, followed by purification using Adeno-X Virus Purification Kit (Clontech). Viruses with shRNA-recombinants were used to infect SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells with 20 viruses per cell, which produced almost 100% infection (data not shown).Male Long\u2013Evans rats (Harlan) weighing \u223c350 g were singly housed with  access to food and water. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Ernest Gallo Clinic and Research Center.Rats anesthetized with isoflurane were stereotaxically infused with Ad-NSS or Ad-sh\u03b14 bilaterally in the NAc shell (AP: +1.6 mm, ML: \u00b10.78 mm, DV: \u22126.5 mm) or core (AP: +1.2 mm, ML: \u00b11.9 mm, DV: \u22126.8 mm; coordinates relative to bregma). A stainless-steel infuser (30 gauge) connected via polyvinyl chloride tubing to a 10 \u03bcl Hamilton Gastight syringe was used to infuse 1 \u03bcl of virus (1 \u00d7 1010 to 3 \u00d7 1010 TU/ml) at a rate of 0.1 \u03bcl/min for 10 min. After an additional 10 min, the infuser was removed and the scalp closed with sutures. Rats were allowed to recover for 5 d.Two bottles, one filled with tap water and the other 10% alcohol (ethanol; v/v), were placed on subjects' cages for 2 weeks before viral infusion. Intake of alcohol and water, as well as body weights, were measured daily, and the left\u2013right position of the bottles was alternated daily to avoid side bias. Five days after viral infusion, rats were again allowed access to 10% alcohol and water for 30 d. To determine whether the alterations in drinking were alcohol specific, a two-bottle preference test comparing 2% sucrose (w/v) and water was conducted in separate rats, as described for alcohol.To test the role of the \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4 GABAAR under conditions likely to induce high intakes, along with corresponding higher blood alcohol levels, a separate group of rats was given limited alchol access for 1 h/d for 21 d following 2 weeks of 24 h  access (as described above). Intake of alcohol and water, as well as body weights, were measured before and after 1 h access every day, and the left\u2013right position of the bottles was alternated daily to avoid side bias. Five days after viral infusion, rats were again allowed access to 10% alcohol (1 h) and water for 30 d.Vibratome cut sections (50 \u03bcm) of fixed tissue were subjected to immunohistochemistry as described (Kharazia et al., 2003). Primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (1:10,000, Abcam) and anti-GFAP (1:1000, Promega). Secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence were donkey anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (1:300, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Images were acquired using a Zeiss confocal microscope and visualized using LSM software.Samples were separated by 4\u201312% SDS-PAGE (Bis-Tris Gel system; Invitrogen) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked in milk solution (5% milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20), and incubated with specific primary antibodies and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The primary antibodies used were anti-\u03b14 antibody (1:500, Novus), anti-\u03b11 antibody (1:500, Phosphosolutions), anti-\u03b22/3 antibody (1:500, Millipore), anti-\u03b32 antibody (1:500, Alpha Diagnostics), anti-\u03b4 antibody (Santa-Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-actin antibodies (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Actin immunoreactivity was used as an internal control. Immunoreactivity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescent reaction and processed using the Typhoon PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Results were quantified with ImageQuant 5.0 (Amersham Biosciences).Rats infused with Ad-NSS or Ad-sh\u03b14-1 were killed at 5, 10, 18, or 25 d after viral infusion ( = 2\u20133 per treatment, per time point). Tissue punches from the NAc were collected and processed for measuring GABAAR \u03b14, \u03b11, \u03b22, \u03b32, or \u03b4 mRNA levels by TaqMan quantitative PCR using primer/probe kits (Applied Biosystems) with  as an internal control.Blood alcohol concentration was determined by gas chromatographic (GC) procedures as described previously (Bowers et al., 2008) with a 0.01 mm limit of detection. Briefly, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and \u223c300\u2013500 \u03bcl of blood was collected from the lateral, rostral tail vein by venous puncture. Blood was vigorously mixed with inversion and centrifuged at 5000 \u00d7  at 4\u00b0C for 20 min. Serum was decanted, vortexed, and 10 \u03bcl of serum was sealed in a GC autosampler vial (National Scientific) with 10 \u03bcl of 0.05% -propanol as an external pipetting standard. Samples, in triplicate, were heated to 65\u00b0C for 20 min, agitated for 30 s, and allowed to settle for 1 min before pressurizing for headspace extraction into a 2 ml, depolarized loop (Tekmar Control Systems). Samples were immediately passed through a 220\u00b0 deactivated, glass-lined inlet (Hewlett-Packard) and subjected to gas chromatography (He, 5 kPa) on a megabore 30 m, 1 \u03bcm film Innowax column (Agilent Technologies) at a 45\u00b0C isotherm and quantified via flame ionization at 310\u00b0C (HP5890, Hewlett-Packard). The column was purged after each sample by holding at 210\u00b0C for 1.5 min before cooling to 45\u00b0C over 5 min. The alcohol area under the curve (AUC) was divided by the external -propanol standard AUC and compared with known standards from 300 to 0.003 mm.Gene expression data calculated as a percentage of control were analyzed by one-sample  test, which infers variation for a control population based on variability in the sample set. Protein expression data were tested using a two-sample  test. Behavioral data were analyzed using one- or two-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni's  test when indicated by significant (\u03b1 = 0.05) main effects or interactions. Blood alcohol data were analyzed using linear regression.To test the role of the \u03b14 subunit in alcohol intake, the technique of viral-mediated RNA interference was applied (Hommel et al., 2003; Lasek et al., 2007). We designed two 21 nt siRNA sequences of the rat \u03b14 subunit. These siRNAs were effective in suppressing \u03b1 mRNA expression in HEK293 cells following transfection of the siRNA constructs recombined in a pRNAT-H1.1 vector, which express the shRNA (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), as well as in striatal neuronal cultures by infection of the siRNA-recombinant adenovirus (Ad-sh\u03b14-1) in comparison with the control siRNA-recombinant adenovirus (Ad-shNSS) (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).Next, we tested the  efficacy of the Ad-sh\u03b14-1 virus, targeting the \u03b14 subunit, and of the Ad-NSS control virus that expresses an RNA sequence that shares no known homology with any sequence in the rat genome. After infusion into the NAc shell, examination of GFP immunohistochemistry revealed that infection of cells within this region was obtained (Fig. 1). We determined the time course of \u03b1 mRNA alterations following dissection of the NAc at multiple time points after Ad-sh\u03b14-1 infusion. We found a transient decrease in GABAAR \u03b14 subunit mRNA levels at 10 and 18 d after infusion ( < 0.01) but not 5 or 25 d (Fig. 2). Ad-sh\u03b14-1 also downregulated \u03b14 protein levels in NAc at day 18 ( < 0.01) (Fig. 2). To test whether the effect of Ad-sh\u03b14-1 was localized to the area of microinfusion within the NAc, we measured \u03b1 subunit mRNA levels in frontal cortex and dorsal striatum and found that \u03b1 subunit mRNA levels were reduced only within the NAc ( < 0.01) 18 d after NAc shell infusion of Ad-sh\u03b14-1 (Fig. 2). To test for compensatory changes in other related GABAAR subunits due to downregulation of the \u03b14 subunit, we measured mRNA and protein levels of the \u03b11, \u03b22, \u03b32, and \u03b4 subunits in NAc and detected no change in the levels of these subunits' mRNA (Fig. 2) or protein (Fig. 2) in the NAc 18 d after viral infusion.Infection of NAc shell with Ad-NSS and Ad-sh\u03b14-1. , Presence of GFP in NAc 10 d after microinjection of virus, as revealed by anti-GFP antibodies (green).

GABAAR \u03b14, \u03b11, \u03b22, \u03b32, and \u03b4 subunits' mRNA or protein levels were measured in tissue punches from rat brains after  infusion of Ad-NSS or Ad-sh\u03b14-1. , Time course of \u03b1 mRNA levels in dissected NAc.

Data presented as mean ratio values (\u00b1SEM) expressed as a percentage of the control ratio (100%).To test the effects of NAc knockdown of the \u03b14 GABAAR subunit on alcohol intake, Ad-sh\u03b14-1 or Ad-NSS was infused into the NAc shell of alcohol-experienced rats. Five days later, subjects were allowed continuous access to 10% alcohol and water. Infusion of the Ad-sh\u03b14-1 virus reduced alcohol intake (Fig. 3) ((3,44) = 17.98,  < 0.0001) and preference (Fig. 3) (main effect of treatment, (1,22) = 3.12,  = 0.09; main effect of day, (3,66) = 5.24,  = 0.002; treatment \u00d7 day interaction, (3,66) = 16.30,  < 0.001) on the 18th day after infusion ( < 0.001, for both intake and preference), a time at which \u03b1 mRNA is significantly reduced (Fig. 2). Examination of the time course (Fig. 3) of Ad-sh\u03b14-1 effects on alcohol intake revealed a main effect of day ((26,572) = 7.10,  < 0.0001) and a significant treatment \u00d7 day interaction ((26,572) = 44.94,  < 0.0001) with no main effect of treatment ((1,22) = 2.60,  = 0.12). The time course of the onset and offset of the reduction in alcohol intake after Ad-sh\u03b14-1 infusion (Fig. 3) paralleled the change in \u03b1 mRNA expression (Fig. 2). Water consumption was not significantly altered (Fig. 3) ((3,44) = 1.36,  = 0.54).Viral-mediated GABAAR \u03b14 subunit knockdown in NAc shell in rats reduces alcohol intake and preference. Rats were infused in the NAc shell with Ad-sh\u03b14-1 ( = 12) or Ad-NSS ( = 12) bilaterally. , Estimated alcohol intake (g/kg) for Ad-sh\u03b14-1-treated rats expressed as a percentage of Ad-NSS-treated rats. * < 0.001, compared with B (baseline). , Alcohol preference for Ad-sh\u03b14-1-treated and Ad-NSS-treated rats (* < 0.001, compared with Ad-NSS). , Time course of alcohol intake after Ad-sh\u03b14-1 or Ad-NSS treatment. , Water intake for Ad-sh\u03b14-1-treated rats expressed as a percentage of Ad-NSS-treated rats. For all panels, \u201cB\u201d refers to baseline, the last day before virus infusion. Values depict mean \u00b1 SEM.Although we did not take blood alcohol measurements from these particular subjects, we took blood samples 3 h after the start of the dark cycle in a separate group of rats maintained on an identical two-bottle 24 h access protocol and found measurable alcohol levels (range, 2.3\u201346.5 mg/dl,  = 10).It is possible that observed effects of short interfering RNA sequences result from a disruption of cellular function, and subsequently, behavior, because the sequence interferes with one or more gene products instead of, or in addition to, the targeted gene. We therefore tested the effects of a second viral vector, Adsh\u03b14-2, that expresses a different shRNA sequence that is effective in downregulating the expression of \u03b1 mRNA and \u03b14 protein levels (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). We again observed a decrease in alcohol intake and preference (supplemental Fig. 3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), supporting the conclusion that the decrease in alcohol self-administration is due to a decrease in the expression of the GABAAR \u03b14 subunit in the NAc shell and not to off-target effects.The NAc shell is proposed to mediate the primary reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse, whereas the NAc core may contribute to conditioned stimulus-supported drug-seeking behavior (Everitt and Robbins, 2005). In line with this view, we found no effect of Ad-sh\u03b14-1 infusion into the NAc core on alcohol intake ((3,44) = 2.27,  = 0.10) (Fig. 4).Effect of viral-mediated GABAAR \u03b14 subunit knockdown in NAc shell on alcohol intake is brain region-specific and alcohol-specific. , Alcohol intake after Ad-sh\u03b14-1 infusion into the NAc core.

For both panels, \u201cB\u201d refers to baseline, the last day before virus infusion. Data are presented as mean ratio values (\u00b1SEM) expressed as a percentage of Ad-NSS-treated rats (100%).GABAAR activation within the NAc shell is implicated in the control of food preference (Baldo and Kelley, 2007); therefore, we tested whether the \u03b14 subunit contributes to intake of the preferred substance, sucrose. Ad-sh\u03b14-1 microinfusion into the NAc shell did not affect intake of a 2% sucrose solution ((3,44) = 1.30,  = 0.28) (Fig. 4), suggesting that the effects of GABAAR \u03b14 subunit reduction are specific to alcohol.The effects of NAc knockdown of the \u03b14 GABAAR subunit on limited access alcohol intake was tested following virus microinfusion into the NAc shell. Ad-sh\u03b14-1 infusion reduced alcohol intake (Fig. 5) ((3,44) = 5.34,  < 0.01) on the 18th day after infusion. Examination of the time course of the effect of the Ad-sh\u03b14-1 virus (Fig. 5) revealed a main effect of day ((26,546) = 3.36,  < 0.0001) and a significant treatment \u00d7 day interaction ((26,546) = 2.5,  < 0.0001) with no main effect of treatment ((1,21) = 4.03,  = 0.058). There was no change in water intake ( = 0.534), although the amounts of water consumed in the 1 h measurement period are so low as to approach the limits of our measurement reliability.Viral-mediated GABAAR \u03b14 subunit knockdown in NAc shell in rats reduces alcohol intake in a limited access paradigm. Rats were infused in the NAc shell with Ad-sh\u03b14-1 ( = 11) or Ad-NSS ( = 11) bilaterally. , Estimated alcohol intake (g/kg) for Ad-sh\u03b14-1-treated rats expressed as a percentage of Ad-NSS-treated rats. * < 0.01, compared with B (baseline). , Time course of alcohol intake after Ad-sh\u03b14-1 or Ad-NSS treatment. For all panels, \u201cB\u201d refers to baseline, the last day before virus infusion. Values depict mean \u00b1 SEM.The limited access paradigm results in higher blood alcohol levels than we observed within the continuous access paradigm. Blood alcohol levels were measured immediately after 1 h ethanol access from a subset of 10 rats from the above study 1 week before the viral infusions. The blood alcohol levels significantly correlated with oral alcohol intake (alcohol intake: 0.55\u20131.59 g/kg; blood alcohol levels: 25\u201383 mg/dl; * < 0.05, 2 = 0.413) (supplemental Fig. 4, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).We found that alcohol intake and preference were decreased by reductions in GABAAR \u03b14 subunit expression in the NAc shell, but not NAc core. In addition, sucrose intake was not altered by decreases in GABAAR \u03b14 subunit expression in the shell. Together, these results support a role for \u03b14-containing GABAARs in voluntary intake of alcohol at the moderate levels experienced after one or a few drinks.GABAAR \u03b14 subunits typically partner with \u03b2 and \u03b4 subunits to form the \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4 GABAAR isoform. Thus, our findings together with a previous study in which \u03b4 knock-out mice consumed less alcohol than wild-type mice (Mihalek et al., 2001) provide strong evidence that \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4 GABAARs contribute to mechanisms mediating alcohol intake. GABAAR \u03b14 subunit knock-out mice have no alteration in acute behavioral effects of alcohol in tests of anxiety, motor behavior, analgesia, and sedation (Chandra et al., 2008). It is interesting to speculate that the \u03b14 subunit may contribute to select behavioral effects of alcohol, including alcohol's reinforcing effects.Because we altered \u03b14 subunit expression in the NAc, it was possible that decreases in alcohol intake could reflect a role of the subunit in reward or reinforcement in general. Indeed, GABAergic mechanisms in the medial shell have been implicated in the intake of preferred substances; specifically, NAc medial shell microinjection of the direct GABA agonist, muscimol, increases intake of sucrose (Basso and Kelley, 1999). However, our finding of no change in sucrose consumption after knocking down the GABAAR \u03b14 subunit in the NAc shell suggests that this result is specific to pharmacological effects of alcohol and not related to general decreases in reward processing, or in motivation for or ingestion of preferred substances. Instead, this result in combination with the lack of effect of \u03b14 knockdown in the NAc core, is congruent with the proposed role of the NAc shell in the direct reinforcing effect of drugs (Everitt and Robbins, 2005; Ikemoto, 2007). In support of this idea, rats will self-administer cocaine (Rodd-Henricks et al., 2002), amphetamine (Ikemoto et al., 2005), and dopamine agonists (McBride et al., 1999) directly into the medial shell/medial olfactory tubercle, the same subregion that we targeted for our infusions.\u03b14-containing GABAARs in some brain regions have been found to be sensitive to low (1\u201330 mm) concentrations of alcohol (Sundstrom-Poromaa et al., 2002; Wallner et al., 2003; Wei et al., 2004). Alcohol concentrations in this range are attained after a few drinks in humans and impair cognition, judgment and motor abilities (Eckardt et al., 1998). We also obtained blood alcohol levels in this range in rats consuming alcohol in both the continuous and limited access paradigms (see Results).The reduced alcohol intake we observed after knockdown of the \u03b14 subunit in the NAc shell can be explained by a decrease in the expression of an \u03b14-containing GABAAR population at which alcohol exerts direct actions. However, our findings cannot exclude the possibility that \u03b14-containing GABAARs mediate indirect effects of alcohol through an intermediary, such as endogenous GABAergic neurosteroids, which act potently at \u03b14-containing GABAARs, and are proposed to mediate some GABAergic effects of alcohol (Morrow et al., 2001). In agreement with this possibility, alcohol intake increases the synthesis of the GABAergic neurosteroid, allopregnanolone, in the nervous system (Finn et al., 2004), and allopregnanolone administration alters alcohol self-administration in nondependent rodents (Janak et al., 1998; Sinnott et al., 2002; Janak and Gill, 2003; Ford et al., 2005). An additional possibility is that \u03b14-containing GABAARs contribute to drinking via alcohol-induced increases in presynaptic GABA release. Concentrations of alcohol as low as 20 mm may increase presynaptic GABA release in the cerebellum (Carta et al., 2004), as well as in the basolateral nucleus (Zhu and Lovinger, 2006) and, at 44 mm, in the central nucleus (Roberto et al., 2003), of the amygdala. The presynaptic effects of low concentrations of alcohol on GABA release in the NAc shell are not known.Whether the actions of alcohol at \u03b14-containing GABAARs are direct or indirect, the primary effect of activation of these receptors is likely to be mediated by enhanced tonic inhibition. Studies of subunit expression in the thalamus and hippocampus indicate that \u03b14-containing GABAARs are primarily extrasynaptic or perisynaptic (Chandra et al., 2006; Liang et al., 2006). These receptors have high affinity for GABA, slowly desensitize, and mediate a tonic inhibitory current that regulates neuronal excitability (Farrant and Nusser, 2005; Chandra et al., 2006). The GABAergic tonic currents mediated by \u03b14-containing GABAARs are reported to be alcohol sensitive (Glykys et al., 2007; Liang et al., 2008), although those of the thalamus require higher alcohol concentrations (Jia et al., 2008). Together, these results suggest the compelling hypothesis that alcohol at moderate levels normally produces reinforcing/rewarding effects by enhancing GABAergic tonic current. Consequently, by this hypothesis, reductions in alcohol-induced GABAergic tonic currents via the knockdown of NAc shell \u03b14 levels would reduce drinking. In the current study, it is possible that a decrease in tonic GABAergic inhibition changed ethanol drinking behavior by inducing compensatory changes in excitatory and/or inhibitory synaptic transmission or in voltage-gated ion channel function. However, given the demonstrated receptor specificity of alcohol's enhancement of tonic currents, we favor a direct modulation of \u03b14-containing GABAARs by alcohol, rather than a more general mechanism. Of note, we found no evidence for compensatory changes in the expression of the mRNA or protein for the \u03b4, \u03b11, \u03b22, and \u03b32 subunits after  injection of the Ad-sh\u03b14-1 virus into the NAc shell.As the GABAAR \u03b14 subunit partners with the \u03b4 subunit at extrasynaptic locations, it is likely that decreasing the expression of \u03b4 subunit in NAc shell also would alter alcohol drinking behavior, in line with the findings from \u03b4\u2212/\u2212 knock-out mice (Mihalek et al., 2001). Other GABAAR subunits have been implicated in alcohol intake: GABAAR \u03b11 and \u03b15 subunit knock-out mice each show decreased alcohol preference (Blednov et al., 2003; Boehm et al., 2004), whereas GABAAR \u03b22 (Blednov et al., 2003) and \u03b12 (Boehm et al., 2004) subunit knock-out mice show no change in their alcohol drinking behavior. The GABAAR \u03b11 results are particularly interesting in light of recent reports of an unexpected \u03b11- and \u03b4-containing GABAAR identified in hippocampal interneurons that mediates an extrasynaptic current sensitive to low alcohol concentrations (Glykys et al., 2007). Understanding the contributions of the GABAAR subunits in the NAc shell other than the \u03b14 awaits future studies of shell-specific reductions in their expression.In conclusion, we have provided empirical evidence that \u03b14-containing GABAARs in the NAc shell play an important role in alcohol drinking behavior, strengthening the hypothesis that the \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4 GABAAR in the NAc shell is a key brain substrate for the reinforcing properties of oral alcohol.This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant R01 AA016835 and by funds from the State of California for medical research on alcohol and substance abuse through the University of California, San Francisco (P.H.J., D.R.).

Reelin signaling involves the lipoprotein receptors apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) and very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), the adapter protein Disabled1 (Dab1), and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K). Eventually, Reelin signaling acts on the cytoskeleton; however, these effects on cytoskeletal organization have remained elusive. In Reelin-deficient mutant mice, most cortical neurons are unable to migrate to their destinations, suggesting a role for Reelin signaling in the dynamic cytoskeletal reorganization that is required for neurons to migrate. Here, we show that Reelin signaling leads to serine3 phosphorylation of n-cofilin, an actin-depolymerizing protein that promotes the disassembly of F-actin. Phosphorylation at serine3 renders n-cofilin unable to depolymerize F-actin, thereby stabilizing the cytoskeleton. We provide evidence for ApoER2, Dab1, Src family kinases (SFKs), and PI3K to be involved in n-cofilin serine3 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of n-cofilin takes place in the leading processes of migrating neurons as they approach the Reelin-containing marginal zone. Immunostaining for phospho-cofilin in dissociated reeler neurons is significantly increased after incubation in Reelin-containing medium compared with control medium. In a stripe choice assay, neuronal processes are stable on Reelin-coated stripes but grow on control stripes by forming lamellipodia. These novel findings suggest that Reelin-induced stabilization of neuronal processes anchors them to the marginal zone which appears to be required for the directional migration process.The six-layered neocortex is formed by the sequential radial migration of neurons generated in the subventricular zone. Early-generated neurons form deep cortical layers, whereas late-generated neurons are destined to superficial positions (Angevine and Sidman, 1961; Berry and Rogers, 1965). This characteristic inside-out layering implies that the late-generated neurons pass the early-generated ones and therefore migrate for longer distances. The sequential lamination of cortical neurons is controlled by the glycoprotein Reelin which is synthesized and secreted by Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells in the marginal zone (Rakic and Caviness, 1995; Curran and D'Arcangelo, 1998; Frotscher, 1998; Rice and Curran, 2001; Tissir and Goffinet, 2003; Soriano and Del Rio, 2005; F\u00f6rster et al., 2006a,b; Cooper, 2008).In the Reelin-deficient mutant reeler, cortical lamination is severely altered. Reeler-like phenotypes were found in mutants deficient in the two Reelin receptors, namely apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) and very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), and in Disabled1 (Dab1), a cytoplasmic adapter protein (Howell et al., 1997; Sheldon et al., 1997; Ware et al., 1997; Lambert de Rouvroit and Goffinet, 1998; Trommsdorff et al., 1999). Binding of Reelin to ApoER2 or VLDLR induces phosphorylation of Dab1 by nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (Hiesberger et al., 1999; Howell et al., 1999; Trommsdorff et al., 1999). Recently, divergent functions of ApoER2 and VLDLR in the migration of cortical neurons have been described (Hack et al., 2007). In a mutants, but not  mutants, late generated neurons are unable to pass early-generated cells and remain close to the subventricular zone, suggesting that Reelin signaling via ApoER2 influences the cytoskeleton to undergo dynamic changes during migration.In migrating cells, the actin cytoskeleton (F-actin) at the leading edge is subjected to an organized process of assembly/disassembly to move the edge forward (Pollard and Borisy, 2003). These cytoskeletal changes are regulated by actin-binding proteins such as cofilin, an essential regulator of actin dynamics (Bamburg, 1999). Cofilin acts as an actin-depolymerizing protein that has severing activity; it binds to actin filaments (F-actin) and promotes their disassembly. Cofilin is located at the membrane of the leading edge of migrating cells, promotes lamellipodia formation by providing actin monomers (Jovceva et al., 2007; Kiuchi et al., 2007), and is required for directional migration (Dawe et al., 2003; Ghosh et al., 2004). In response to extracellular signals, cofilin is phosphorylated by LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1, Arber et al., 1998; Yang et al., 1998) which disables its capacity to bind and depolymerize F-actin. As a result, actin dynamics and subsequent process extension are inhibited (Moriyama et al., 1996; Nagaoka et al., 1996; Zebda et al., 2000). An essential role of cofilin in the migration of cortical neurons has recently been shown by Bellenchi et al. (2007) who found n-cofilin (nonmuscle cofilin) dysfunction to be associated with neuronal migration disorders.In the present study we describe a role for Reelin signaling in n-cofilin phosphorylation. Reelin signaling enhanced the activity of LIMK1, resulting in increased n-cofilin phosphorylation at serine3 and thus a stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton.Reeler mice (B6C3Fe-a/a-) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory; \n\u2212/\u2212 mice (Howell et al., 1997) and  and  knock-out mice (Trommsdorff et al., 1999) were obtained from Dr. J. Herz, Department of Molecular Genetics, UT Southwestern, Dallas, TX. All animals were maintained in accordance with the institutional guidelines of the University of Freiburg. Genotypes were confirmed by PCR analysis of genomic DNA.The following primary antibodies were used for immunocytochemical studies and Western blot analyses: mouse monoclonal anti-Reelin G10 (dilution 1:1000; Millipore), rabbit polyclonal anti-actin (1:1000, Sigma), mouse monoclonal anti-Map2 (1:1000; Sigma), rabbit polyclonal anti-cofilin (1:200; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-cofilin (ser 3; 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-LIMK1 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit polyclonal anti-AKT (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-AKT (ser 473; 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Src (tyr 416; 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit monoclonal antibody to neuronal class III \u03b2-tubulin (TUJ1; 1:1000; Covance), mouse monoclonal anti-RC2 (1:5; Developmental Hybridoma Bank), mouse monoclonal anti-Nestin (1:1000; Millipore).PP2 (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl) pyrazolo ([3, 4-d]) pyrimidine), an inhibitor of SFKs, was purchased from Merck, and inhibitors of PI3K, LY294002 and Wortmannin, were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology.HEK 293-cells transfected with plasmid pcDNA3 combined with full-length Reelin cDNA and stably expressing Reelin (D'Arcangelo et al., 1997; F\u00f6rster et al., 2002), and control HEK 293-cells transfected with a plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) were grown in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified eagle medium, low glucose, Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Invitrogen), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (P/S, 10,000 U/ml, Invitrogen) and 0.9 g/L G418 (Geneticin, Invitrogen) for 2 d to reach full confluence. The medium was then replaced by hybridoma serum-free medium (Invitrogen), and the cells were incubated for 3 d at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. Conditioned medium of Reelin-synthesizing 293-cells and the control medium of GFP-expressing 293-cells were collected and centrifuged at a speed of 4000 \u00d7  for 5 min to remove dead cells. The supernatants were used immediately for the acute treatment of neurons and hippocampal cell cultures. For the coating of coverslips, Reelin-enriched supernatants were concentrated tenfold with centricon 100 columns (Amicon, Millipore) before use.Reeler embryos  = 88),  mutant embryos [ = 20, embryonic day (E) 17.5], \n\u2212/\u2212 mutants ( = 7, E17.5 and E19) and \n\u2212/\u2212 mutants ( = 8, E17.5 and E19), and wild-type littermates ( = 6) were harvested from pregnant, anesthetized dams (intraperitoneal injection of 10 ml/kg Avertin; Sigma). The tails of the embryos were removed for genotyping. The hemispheres were isolated in ice-cold HBSS (Invitrogen), and after removing the meninges, the tissue was chopped in the - and -axis with a tissue chopper into 100-\u03bcm-thick small pieces. The pieces were collected and equally divided into two 1.5 ml tubes and resuspended in ice-cold HBSS.After centrifugation, the preparation buffer was discarded. 1 ml of Reelin-containing supernatant or control supernatant was added to the cell pellets which were resuspended and incubated for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. Thereafter, the tissue was centrifuged, supernatants were discarded, and the pellets were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use for protein extraction and Western blot analysis.Tissue from E17.5 reeler cerebral cortex was prepared as described. After centrifugation, neuronal pellets were suspended with 1 ml of Reelin-containing supernatant or control supernatant supplemented with various inhibitors (see below), and incubated for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. Inhibitors were diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, final concentration 0.5%) and used at the following concentrations: PP2 (10 \u03bcm), LY294002 (20 \u03bcm), and Wortmannin (50 nm) (Bock et al., 2003; Konno et al., 2005). After treatment, the suspensions were centrifuged, and supernatants were removed. The pellets were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until required for protein extraction and Western blot analysis. A total of 32 reeler mice (E17.5) were used for the experiments with PP2, 26 reeler mutants (E17.5) were used for the experiments with LY294002 and Wortmannin.Tissue pellets (\u221280\u00b0C) were incubated in ice-cold hypertonic lysis buffer [pH 7.6, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA-Na2, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 0.25% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate] with 1% protease inhibitor (Sigma), and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma). The tissue was lysed by repeated freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing at 37\u00b0C (5 times). After the tissue was triturated with a pipette tip to homogenize larger pieces of tissue and sonicated for 5 min, the suspension was centrifuged at 20,000 \u00d7  at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. The resulting crude supernatants were taken, and protein concentration was measured by using BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Aliquots of the supernatants were immediately used for Western blotting or were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use.Five to ten micrograms of each sample were diluted in ultrapure water containing 1\u00d7 NuPAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen) and 1\u00d7 NuPAGE reducing agent (Invitrogen) to final volumes of 24 \u03bcl, boiled at 95\u00b0C for 5 min, and then immediately placed on ice. The samples were separated by NuPAGE Bis-Tris, pH 7.0, 4 \u2013 12% PAGE (Invitrogen) with 1\u00d7 NuPAGE MES-SDS running buffer (Invitrogen) and transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes with 1\u00d7 NuPAGE transfer buffer (Invitrogen). For blotting, membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk or 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) at room temperature (RT) for 1 h and finally incubated with primary antibodies in blocking solution at 4\u00b0C overnight. This was followed by detection with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Western Breeze Chemiluminescent Immunodetection Kit, Invitrogen). The immunoreaction was visualized by enhanced chemiluminiscence. At least three Western blots were analyzed for each experiment. Films were digitally scanned using an Artix Scan 1100 Scanner (Mikrotek), and band optical density (OD) was quantified by measuring the mean intensity of the band signal using Image J 1.40 analysis software (National Institutes of Health). Differences between groups were tested for statistical significance (mean \u00b1 SEM, two-tailed Student's  test, * < 0.05, ** < 0.01, *** < 0.001).Coverslips were coated with Reelin-containing stripes of 40 \u03bcm width as described in detail by Kn\u00f6ll et al. (2007). In short, poly-ornithine-coated coverslips were placed on silicon stripe matrices, and concentrated Reelin supernatant was injected with a microliter syringe into the channels of the matrix and incubated for 30 min. For visualization of the stripes, fluorescent microspheres (0.5 \u03bcm in diameter, Invitrogen) or fluorescent secondary antibodies were used as described (Kn\u00f6ll et al., 2007). The coated coverslips were then transferred to 24-well plates and incubated in 10\u00d7 concentrated supernatant from GFP-transfected control cells not containing Reelin to cover control stripes with the same protein mixture except Reelin. After washing with PBS, the coverslips were covered with incubation medium, and the stripe quality was checked under a fluorescence microscope.For primary cell cultures, newborn (P0) reeler mutants and wild-type mice ( = 10 for each group), and for incubation on stripe matrices, rat pups (P5,  = 10) were used. The hippocampus was dissected and put into ice-cold HBSS. After removal of the meninges, the hippocampi of both hemispheres were collected and maintained in 15 ml Falcon tubes (BD Biosciences) containing 3 ml of 0.5% Trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTAx4Na (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10 min. The hippocampi were then washed twice in ice-cold HBSS and manually triturated with a polished glass Pasteur pipet for several times. Then, the cells were centrifuged at low speed (800 \u00d7 ) for 3 min to discard dead cells. The sediment was collected in fresh Falcon tubes and centrifuged again. The supernatant was discarded, and cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of Neurobasal-A medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 2% B27 (Invitrogen), 1 mm Glutamax (Invitrogen), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Hippocampal cells were counted using a hemocytometer and suspended at a density of 5 \u00d7 105 cells in 0.5 ml aliquots on glass coverslips inserted in 24-well plates. The coverslips had been coated overnight with a solution of 20 \u03bcg/ml poly-l-ornithine (Sigma) prepared in borate buffer, pH 8.1. After 2 h of incubation in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 to allow for cell attachment, the medium was changed to remove dead cells. After another 24 h of incubation, cultures of wild-type cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 m PBS, pH 7.4, for 15 min at RT and rinsed in 0.1 m PBS for 1 h followed by incubation in blocking solution. In the reeler cultures, the medium was replaced on the first day  (DIV1) by 500 \u03bcl of Reelin-containing supernatant or control supernatant. After 15 min of incubation at 37\u00b0C, the cultures were fixed with 4% PFA in 0.1 m PBS for 15 min at RT and rinsed in 0.1 m PBS for 1 h followed by incubation in blocking solution.For cortical tissue sections, reeler mutants and wild-type mice at E17.5, and for cell cultures newborn wild-type and reeler mice were used ( = 6 for each group). Pregnant dams were anesthetized with isoflurane (Abbott), and the embryos were dissected in ice-cold HBSS. P0 mice were decapitated under hypothermic anesthesia. Brains were removed and immersion-fixed in 0.1 m PBS containing 4% PFA overnight at 4\u00b0C. After washing for 2 h at RT in 0.1 m PBS, brains were embedded in 5% agar and cut into 40-\u03bcm-thick slices on a Leica VT 1000S vibratome (Leica Microsystems). The sections were placed in a 24-well plate containing 0.1 m PBS.Tissue sections and cell cultures were preincubated with blocking solution (5% normal goat serum and 1% BSA in 0.1 m PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100) at RT for 1 h and then incubated with the following primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution overnight at 4\u00b0C: mouse anti-Reelin (G10), rabbit anti-phospho-cofilin, rabbit anti-Map2, mouse anti-RC2, and mouse anti-Nestin. After washing in 0.1 m PBS for 1 h, sections or cultured cells were incubated in secondary antibodies diluted in 0.1 m PBS for 1 h at RT. The secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (green, 1:300; Invitrogen) and/or Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (red, 1:300; Invitrogen) Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated goat anti-mouse (red, 1:300; Invitrogen). Sections or cultured cells were counterstained with DAPI (1:10,000; Invitrogen). Some cell cultures were stained for F-actin with 10 \u03bcm TRITC-labeled phalloidin (Sigma). After rinsing in 0.1 m PBS for 2 h, sections and cells were mounted in Moviol on glass slides. Sections and cultured cells were photographed using an Olympus microscope (Olympus BX61) or a confocal microscope (LSM 510, Carl Zeiss) and a 40\u00d7 oil-immersion objective. The confocal microscope was used to acquire -series of brain sections at 1 \u03bcm intervals through a tissue depth of 21 \u03bcm. The -series were then visualized as single optical scans with concurrent orthogonal views using LSM 510 software.After initial incubation at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere, dissociated neurons on stripe assays were transferred to a live incubation chamber (37\u00b0C, humidified, 5% CO2), attached to an inverted Axiovert 200 microscope (Carl Zeiss). Images at single time points were captured with an AxioCam MRm camera (Carl Zeiss) and processed with Axiovision LE software.The phosphorylation of cofilin at serine3 in reeler hippocampal cells (DIV 1) treated with recombinant Reelin or with control supernatant for 15 min ( = 100 cells each in a total of 48 cultures) was measured by using analysis SIS software (Soft Imaging Systems). In brief, 15-\u03bcm-long phospho-cofilin-positive neuronal processes 5 \u03bcm away from their origin from the cell body were traced, subdivided into proximo-distal segments, and then fluorescence intensities were measured. The ratio of fluorescence intensity of p-cofilin pixels to phalloidin or Map2 pixels was taken for each image and used for comparison between experimental conditions. Differences between groups were tested for statistical significance using the two-tailed Student's  test ( < 0.01).Substrate-dependent p-cofilin immunostaining in the stripe choice assay was quantified in bipolar cells with one process located on the Reelin stripe and a second process on the control stripe. Only isolated neurons without contact to other neurons were chosen (25 cells from 5 different stripe matrices). Fluorescence images were collected using an Axioskop 2 (Carl Zeiss) and an Axiocam digital camera (Carl Zeiss). For data acquisition, Axiovision software (Carl Zeiss) was used. Fluorescence intensity of process tips with background fluorescence intensity subtracted was measured by using Image J software (National Institutes of Health).As a first step in our study of a potential function of Reelin signaling in n-cofilin phosphorylation, we compared the levels of phosphorylated n-cofilin protein in embryonic cortices (E18) of wild-type animals, heterozygous mice, and reeler mutants. In cortical lysates prepared from reeler mutants, the level of n-cofilin serine3 phosphorylation was found to be significantly lower than that of wild-type animals or heterozygous mice (Fig. 1\n,). No difference was detected when lysates from heterozygous mice and from wild-type animals were compared.Reelin induces phosphorylation of n-cofilin. \n\n, In cortical lysates prepared from E18 wild-type animals (\n+/+) or heterozygous mice (\n+/\u2212), the protein level of phosphorylated n-cofilin at serine3 (p-cofilin) is higher than that of their reeler (\n\u2212/\u2212) littermates. No difference was found when lysates from heterozygous mice and from wild-type animals were compared. Actin Western blot as a loading control. \n\n, Densitometric analysis of cofilin phosphorylation in the three genotypes (3 independent experiments). Signals are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. Cofilin phosphorylation is significantly decreased in reeler tissue when compared with tissue from wild-type animals or heterozygous mice (*** < 0.001, Student's  test; n.s., not significant). \n\n, Reelin treatment of neurons from E17.5 reeler cerebral cortex strongly increased the level of p-cofilin. Phosphorylation of LIMK1, the n-cofilin-phosphorylating kinase, was similarly increased after Reelin treatment. Phosphorylation levels of both n-cofilin and LIMK1 were decreased when incubated in the presence of PP2, an inhibitor of Src family kinases (SFKs). Phosphorylation of Src was increased after incubation with recombinant Reelin and was decreased in the presence of PP2. Cofilin was used to normalize protein loading. \n\n, \n\n, Densitometric analysis of cofilin and LIMK1 phosphorylation in tissue treated with Reelin or Reelin+PP2. Results are from five independent experiments; statistically significant differences are indicated (unpaired  test, ** < 0.01, *** < 0.001).To examine whether recombinant Reelin stimulates n-cofilin serine3 phosphorylation in cortical tissue of reeler mutants , we treated tissue of E17.5 cerebral cortex with recombinant Reelin. Western blot analysis showed that Reelin significantly increased the level of phosphorylated n-cofilin (Fig. 1\n,). Phosphorylation of LIMK1, the n-cofilin-phosphorylating kinase, is similarly increased after Reelin treatment (Fig. 1\n,). Phosphorylation levels of both n-cofilin and LIMK1 were significantly decreased when incubated in the presence of PP2 (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl) pyrazolo ([3,4-d]) pyrimidine), an inhibitor of Src family kinases (SFKs) (Fig. 1\n). Likewise, the phosphorylation of Src family kinases was increased after incubation with recombinant Reelin and was decreased in the presence of PP2 (Fig. 1\n).The nonreceptor tyrosine kinases Src and Fyn are known to phosphorylate Dab1, an adapter protein associated with the intracellular domains of the Reelin receptors ApoER2 and VLDLR (Howell et al., 1997; Arnaud et al., 2003a; Bock and Herz, 2003). As shown, incubation of reeler cortical tissue in the presence of recombinant Reelin strongly induced phosphorylation of SFKs (Fig. 1\n). For the next step, we examined whether Reelin-induced serine3 phosphorylation of cofilin is Dab1-dependent. We found that Reelin upregulated phospho-serine3-cofilin in \n+/+ mice and \n+/\u2212 mice compared with untreated control tissue, although this upregulation was less pronounced than in reeler tissue (Figs. 1\n,; 2\n,). The effect was abolished in \n\u2212/\u2212 mutants (Fig. 2\n,). These results suggest that the Reelin-induced serine3 phosphorylation of n-cofilin requires the adapter protein Dab1, and confirm that Dab1 phosphorylation is mediated by SFKs, consistent with the observation that absence of  and  results in a reeler-like phenotype (Kuo et al., 2005). Our results point to an involvement of SFKs in cofilin phosphorylation, because treatment of reeler cortical tissue with Reelin in the presence of the SFK inhibitor PP2 significantly reduced serine3 phosphorylation of cofilin when compared with Reelin treatment alone (Fig. 1\n).Reelin-induced phosphorylation of n-cofilin involves Dab1, PI3K, and ApoER2. \n\n, Reelin upregulates p-cofilin in E17.5 \n+/\u2212 mice and \n+/+ mice compared with untreated control tissue, an effect that was abolished in \n\u2212/\u2212 mutants.

Phosphorylation levels were significantly lower in reeler mice, \n\u2212/\u2212 mice, and \n\u2212/\u2212 mice when compared with wild-type animals (*** < 0.001). No significant differences were found between tissues from reeler mice, \n\u2212/\u2212 mice, and \n\u2212/\u2212 mice.Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) has been shown to interact with the adapter protein Dab1 in response to Reelin signaling and is required for normal cortical lamination (Bock et al., 2003). By using LY294002 and Wortmannin, inhibitors of PI3K, we found that blocking PI3K strongly reduced the Reelin-induced serine3 phosphorylation of n-cofilin; in the presence of the inhibitors, no significant changes were observed between Reelin-treated and untreated tissue (Fig. 2\n,). These results suggest that PI3K is involved in Reelin-cofilin signaling.To investigate whether Reelin-induced serine3 phosphorylation of n-cofilin involves the Reelin receptors ApoER2 and VLDLR, we treated acutely dissociated cerebral cortex from E19 \n\u2212/\u2212 mutants, \n\u2212/\u2212 mutants, and wild-type mice with recombinant Reelin. Western blot analysis showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the level of n-cofilin serine3 phosphorylation when wild-type tissue and VLDLR\u2212/\u2212 tissue were compared. However, n-cofilin serine3 phosphorylation was significantly decreased in tissue of \n\u2212/\u2212 mutants treated with recombinant Reelin (Fig. 2\n,). Moreover, we also compared the levels of uninduced p-cofilin (not induced by incubation in the presence of Reelin) in E17.5 wild-type tissue with those of E17.5 reeler mice, \n\u2212/\u2212 mice, and \n\u2212/\u2212 and \n\u2212/\u2212 mutants (Fig. 2\n,). Whereas the levels of cofilin phosphorylation were significantly decreased in tissue from reeler mice, \n\u2212/\u2212 mice, and \n\u2212/\u2212mice, no significant difference from wild-type was found in tissue from \n\u2212/\u2212 mutants. There were no significant differences in the levels of uninduced p-cofilin between \n\u2212/\u2212 mice, \n\u2212/\u2212 mice, and reeler mutants (Fig. 2\n). Together, these findings support our previous observation that ApoER2, but not VLDLR, is required for the proper migration of late-generated neurons that are destined to the superficial layers. In \n\u2212/\u2212 mutants, but not in \n\u2212/\u2212 mutants, late generated neurons are unable to migrate away from their site of generation in the subventricular zone (Hack et al., 2007). We hypothesize that the lack of ApoER2-mediated Reelin signaling leading to decreased serine3 phosphorylation of n-cofilin is involved in this migrational defect.Our results have provided evidence for an involvement of the Reelin signaling cascade in serine3 phosphorylation of n-cofilin. During development, Reelin is mainly localized to the marginal zone of the cortex, but some immunoreactivity for Reelin is also seen in deep cortical layers containing early generated neurons (Soriano and Del Rio, 2005) (Fig. 3\n). Where would we find phosphorylated n-cofilin? To address this issue, we immunostained sections of E17.5 wild-type and reeler cerebral cortex for Reelin and phosphorylated n-cofilin. We found phosphorylated n-cofilin preferentially located in the Reelin-containing marginal zone and in the cell bodies of early generated deep-layered neurons that extend their apical processes toward the pial surface (Fig. 3\n). In sections of reeler mutants, staining for Reelin was limited to unspecific labeling of blood vessels (Fig. 3\n), with an absence of specific staining in the marginal zone. Immunostaining for serine3 phospho-cofilin was generally decreased in the reeler cortex with some diffuse staining near the cortical surface (Fig. 3\n). The intense staining of deep cortical layers for phospho-cofilin is absent (compare Fig. 3\n, and ,), reflecting the migration defect of early generated neurons. The staining for serine3 phospho-cofilin in the marginal zone of reeler mutants suggests that cofilin may be phosphorylated by other signaling molecules in addition to Reelin. For example, integrin receptors may interact with the extracellular matrix and can induce the serine3 phosphorylation of n-cofilin via c-Src (Kim et al., 2008).Phosphorylated n-cofilin is preferentially localized to the Reelin-containing marginal zone and deep layers of early generated neurons.

The intense staining of deep cortical layers for p-cofilin was absent, reflecting the migration defect of early generated neurons. \n\n, Merged staining for p-cofilin and Reelin in the reeler cortex, section counterstained with DAPI (blue). Scale bar, (\n\n) 75 \u03bcm.High-power magnification of sections double-labeled for Reelin and phospho-cofilin revealed immunoreactivity for phospho-cofilin in the leading processes of neurons located underneath the marginal zone and in the cell bodies of deep-layered neurons (Fig. 4). The figure also demonstrates that phospho-cofilin, although enriched in the marginal zone, is either rarely contained or absent in Reelin-synthesizing Cajal-Retzius cells, a finding that was confirmed when single confocal scans were studied (Fig. 5\n). In contrast, double staining for p-cofilin and Map2, a microtubule-associated protein and marker of neuronal dendrites, showed colocalization mainly in dendritic segments approaching the marginal zone (Fig. 5\n). Virtually no colocalization was found when antibodies to p-cofilin were combined with the radial glial cell markers Nestin or RC2 (Fig. 5\n,).Immunostaining for phosphorylated n-cofilin labels the leading processes of late generated neurons in superficial cortical layers and the cell bodies of early generated neurons of deep layers.

Scale bar, 40 \u03bcm.Phosphorylated n-cofilin is localized to Map2-positive neuronal processes but not to Reelin-immunoreactive CR cells and Nestin-positive or RC2-positive radial glial fibers from E17.5 wild-type animals.

Scale bars, 50 \u03bcm.To visualize Reelin-induced n-cofilin phosphorylation in neurons, primary neuronal cultures prepared from P0 reeler hippocampi were treated with recombinant Reelin or control supernatant. After staining for phalloidin, a marker of F-actin, we noticed that F-actin was localized to neuronal cell bodies and processes (Fig. 6\n,). Immunostaining for phosphorylated n-cofilin labeled the same neuronal processes (Fig. 6\n,,,) but was significantly stronger after treatment with Reelin than with control supernatant of GFP-expressing cells (two-tailed Student's  test,  < 0.01). Double labeling of Reelin-stimulated cells with Map2, a microtubule-associated protein and a marker of neuronal dendrites, revealed similar results to that of phalloidin staining. Incubation in the presence of Reelin increased phospho-serine3 cofilin immunostaining in Map2-positive cell bodies and dendrites (Fig. 7\n) when compared with control cells (Fig. 7\n). Quantification of fluorescence intensity for phosphorylated cofilin revealed significantly higher values for Reelin-treated cells when compared with control cells (two-tailed Student's  test,  < 0.01).Phosphorylated n-cofilin is localized to phalloidin-positive processes of cultured neurons prepared from P0 reeler hippocampus. \n\n, \n\n, Immunostaining for phalloidin, a marker of F-actin (red), shows that F-actin is localized to cell bodies and processes. \n\n, \n\n, Phosphorylated n-cofilin (green) is clearly present in the same neuronal cell bodies and processes (arrowheads) after incubation in the presence of recombinant Reelin. \n\n, \n\n, Immunostaining for phosphorylated n-cofilin is weaker in processes (arrowhead) of neurons treated with control supernatant.

Scale bar, (\n\n) 15 \u03bcm.Together, our immunocytochemical results of tissue sections and cultured neurons show that Reelin-induced phosphorylation of cofilin at serine3 takes place in neuronal dendrites. Strong labeling in the marginal zone containing the apical tuft of radially migrating pyramidal neurons suggests that Reelin-induced n-cofilin serine3 phosphorylation might stabilize their leading processes that become the neurons' apical dendrites, anchoring the cells to the surface of the cortex (Pinto-Lord and Caviness, 1979; Miyata et al., 2001).To study process stability of hippocampal neurons  when encountering a Reelin substrate that imitates the Reelin-rich marginal zone, dissociated hippocampal neurons were incubated on coverslips coated with stripes (40 \u03bcm width) of recombinant Reelin, alternating with control stripes. The differentiation of neuronal processes on the striped substrate was studied within the first 24 h after plating. Outgrowing neuronal processes did not show a preference for a specific substrate. Thus, many cells immunoreactive for TUJ1, a neuronal marker, were found to give rise to processes on either the control substrate or the Reelin substrate (Fig. 8\n). However, an asymmetric distribution of lamellipodia was observed with the lamellipodia-rich processes attached to the control substrate and smooth, lamellipodia-poor processes attached to the Reelin-coated stripe, an effect that was even visible in individual neurons extending different processes to these different substrates (Fig. 8\n). In 19 of 25 neurons projecting a process to either stripe, lamellipodia formation was clearly observed in processes on the control stripes but strongly reduced in processes on Reelin stripes. In these studies lamellipodia were defined as flat expansions at the ends of neuronal processes that give rise to microspikes made of actin ribs compared with smooth, spike-free swellings (supplemental Fig. S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Our findings suggest a Reelin-induced inhibition of lamellipodia formation, likely because of increased phosphorylation of n-cofilin at serine3. In fact, when these neurons were immunostained for phosphorylated cofilin, the processes on the Reelin stripes were more heavily labeled than those on the control stripes (Fig. 8\n). The mean fluorescence intensity for p-cofilin in terminal swellings was significantly increased on Reelin-coated stripes when compared with control stripes ( < 0.001). In line with these results, real-time microscopy of outgrowing processes from neurons located at the border between a Reelin stripe and a control stripe showed a differential process outgrowth depending on the substrate. In time-lapse studies of 4 neurons, each extending different processes to a Reelin-coated stripe and a control stripe, the processes on the Reelin substrate were stable whereas those on the control substrate were actively growing (Fig. 9). Remarkably, the process labeled by arrow in Figure 9 grew during an initial phase on the Reelin substrate with very low speed but extended quickly on entering the control substrate. Together, these findings indicate cytoskeletal stabilization of neuronal processes encountering Reelin.Reelin stabilizes neuronal processes by phosphorylation of n-cofilin at serine3. \n\n, TUJ-1-positive neuron partially located on a Reelin stripe (identified by red fluorescent beads) and on a control stripe.

Whereas the process on the Reelin stripe (asterisk) did not change over time (78 min), the process extending to the control stripe (arrow) increased considerably in length during this period. Scale bar, 20 \u03bcm.The results of the present study show that Reelin signaling induces the phosphorylation of n-cofilin. Phosphorylation of n-cofilin at serine3 was reduced in tissue of Reelin-deficient reeler mutants, and incubation of reeler tissue in the presence of recombinant Reelin strongly increased n-cofilin phosphorylation. In addition, our findings indicate that LIMK1, a kinase that phosphorylates cofilin, is phosphorylated in the presence of Reelin. Phosphorylation of cofilin is strongly reduced in mutants lacking the Reelin receptor ApoER2 or the adaptor protein Dab1. Because phosphorylation of n-cofilin reduces actin dynamics (Moriyama et al., 1996; Nagaoka et al., 1996; Zebda et al., 2000; Jovceva et al., 2007), stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton is likely to play an important role in Reelin's effects on migrating neurons. Acting as a positional signal in the marginal zone (Zhao et al., 2004; F\u00f6rster et al., 2006a,b), Reelin induces phosphorylation of n-cofilin in the leading processes of migrating neurons which may be crucial for the cytoskeletal stabilization that anchors these processes to the marginal zone and is required for the directional migration process (Cooper, 2008).Cortical neurons are born in the subventricular zone and migrate to their destinations in the cortical plate by two different modes, somal translocation and glia-guided migration, respectively (Nadarajah and Parnavelas, 2002; Nadarajah et al., 2003; Kubo and Nakajima, 2003; Hatanaka et al., 2004). Somal translocation predominates during the early phases of cortical development; thereafter, when the migratory route to the cortical plate has increased, migrating neurons are guided by radial glial fibers extending from the subventricular zone to the surface of the cortex. Somal translocation is not simply replaced by glia-guided migration during cortical development: After the migration along radial glial fibers, late generated neurons eventually move toward their final destination by somal translocation (Nadarajah et al., 2001; Cooper, 2008).How is Reelin signaling involved in these processes? Suetsugu et al. (2004) have suggested that Dab1 activates N-WASP (neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) and induces actin polymerization through the Arp2/3 (actin-related protein 2/3) complex. The Arp2/3 complex is known to initiate new actin polymerization at the leading edge of migrating cells. Overexpression of Dab1 in COS-7 cells induced filopodia formation, a process associated with increased cell motility. In contrast, Dab1 phosphorylation by Fyn reduced filopodia formation (Suetsugu et al., 2004). Binding of Reelin to ApoER2 and VLDLR, respectively, results in the phosphorylation of Dab1 by Fyn and Src kinases and the ubiquitination of phosphorylated Dab1 as a mechanism of protein degradation (Arnaud et al., 2003b; Bock et al., 2004). These findings indicate a means by which Reelin signaling via phosporylation and ubiquitination of Dab1 controls Dab1 levels and, in turn, actin cytoskeleton dynamics (Winder, 2004).Cooper and his associates (Feng et al., 2007) have recently extended these studies and have shown that degradation of Dab1 depends both on Dab1 phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues and the E3 ubiquitin ligase component Cullin5 (Cul5). Ablation of Cul5 in migrating neurons prevented Dab1 degradation. Accumulation of Dab1 protein resulted in an excess of migrating neurons at the top of the cortical plate (\u201covermigration\u201d). Reelin signaling, which induces Dab1 phosphorylation and ubiquitination, thus counteracts the promigratory role of Dab1 (Feng et al., 2007; Kerjan and Gleeson, 2007).The results of the present study point to an alternative way in which Reelin acts to control actin dynamics. Reelin signaling via ApoER2 and Dab1 phosphorylates LIM kinase 1, the same kinase that phosphorylates n-cofilin at serine3. Cofilin is known to promote lamellipodia formation by generating an abundant supply of actin monomers (Kiuchi et al., 2007). Lamellipodia are formed at the leading processes of migrating neurons. Phosphorylation at serine3 renders n-cofilin unable to depolymerize actin filaments, a process which is otherwise necessary to stabilize the actin cytoskeleton (Moriyama et al., 1996; Nagaoka et al., 1996; Zebda et al., 2000; Jovceva et al., 2007). Remarkably, Reelin-induced ubiquitination of Dab1 and n-cofilin phosphorylation reduce formation of filopodia and lamellipodia, respectively, thus decreasing cell motility rather than stimulating it. However, it is the reeler phenotype that is characterized by the inability of late-generated neurons to bypass their predecessors, resulting in an inversion of cortical layers. Reelin signaling via ApoER2 was recently found to be important for late generated neurons to migrate to superficial positions (Hack et al., 2007). How does Reelin-induced phosphorylation of n-cofilin, which is mediated via ApoER2, and the resulting stabilization of the cytoskeleton, contribute to the directional migration of late-generated neurons to superficial layers in the cortex?Recent studies have shown that radial glial cells express molecules of the Reelin signaling cascade (F\u00f6rster et al., 2002; Luque et al., 2003), adhere to a Reelin-, but not control substrate (F\u00f6rster et al., 2002; Frotscher et al., 2003), and extend their processes toward a Reelin source (F\u00f6rster et al., 2002; Hartfuss et al., 2003; Zhao et al., 2004). Because radial glial cells are precursors of neurons (Malatesta et al., 2000; Noctor et al., 2001; G\u00f6tz et al., 2002; Kriegstein and G\u00f6tz, 2003) and the radial glial fiber is inherited by one of the daughter cells and becomes the neuron's leading process and apical dendrite, respectively (Miyata et al., 2001), the polar orientation of these processes is also likely to depend on the presence of Reelin in the marginal zone. In fact, in reeler mutants, many misoriented pyramidal cells are found (Landrieu and Goffinet, 1981; Terashima et al., 1985, 1992). The tips of both radial glial fibers and apical dendrites are known to branch in the marginal zone, thereby anchoring the parent cells to the pial surface, a process that may be crucial for the directional movement of radially migrating neurons (Olson et al., 2006).Unexpectedly, we did not find evidence for increased phosphorylation of cofilin in the endfeet of radial glial fibers in the marginal zone. This was in stark contrast to the increasing p-cofilin immunostaining in the leading processes of neurons approaching the marginal zone. We conclude that neuronal migration by nuclear translocation, which requires cytoskeletal stabilization of the leading process and its anchorage to the pial surface to allow for the directional movement of the nucleus, is impaired in the absence of Reelin-induced cofilin phosphorylation. This view is supported by a relatively normal radial glial scaffold in the neocortex (but not hippocampus) (Weiss et al., 2003) of reeler mice and ApoER2 mutants (Hack et al., 2007).As one would expect, immunostaining for phospho-cofilin is very strong in the marginal zone containing CR cells which synthesize and secrete Reelin. Migrating neurons extend their leading processes toward the marginal zone, and phospho-cofilin immunostaining was seen in these processes (Fig. 4). We conclude that the Reelin-induced phosphorylation of n-cofilin takes place in these processes, thereby attaching them to the marginal zone and providing the proper orientation for the directional migration process. In turn, decreased levels of phosphorylated n-cofilin in the absence of Reelin are likely to be accompanied by a persistent dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton, and thus a relative instability of these processes, resulting in an altered orientation and migration of neurons in the reeler mutant. Using the stripe choice assay, even different processes of individual neurons were found to display a different behavior: Processes extending to Reelin stripes were stable over time, whereas those on control stripes developed lamellipodia as a sign of ongoing actin dynamics, and increased considerably in length over a time period of an hour (Fig. 9). Remarkably, in a recent study analyzing proteome changes induced by RNA interference-mediated alterations in actin signaling, phospho-cofilin was the only protein identified whose expression correlated with actin filament levels and lamellipodia formation (Jovceva et al., 2007). During the actual migration process cytoskeletal stabilization and lamellipodia formation in the leading process may fluctuate depending on the availability of phosphorylated Dab1: Phosphorylation of n-cofilin may be terminated by the ubiquitination of phosphorylated Dab1 (Feng et al., 2007).The present study provides evidence for the involvement of signaling molecules of the Reelin pathway such as Dab1, SFKs, and PI3K in LIMK1 and cofilin phosphorylation (Fig. 10). Regarding the role of Reelin receptors in the phosphorylation of n-cofilin, ApoER2 appears to be required to a greater extent than VLDLR. Previous studies have shown that in  mutants, but not  mutants, late-generated cortical neurons are unable to bypass earlier-generated cells and remain near their site of generation (Hack et al., 2007). We hypothesize that directional migration is altered in these late-generated neurons, likely because of an altered cytoskeletal stabilization of their leading processes.Schematic diagram of LIM kinase-dependent inhibition of n-cofilin activity by Reelin. Binding of Reelin to the transmembrane receptor ApoER2 induces reciprocal activation (arrows) of the receptor-associated cytosolic adapter protein Disabled-1 (Dab1) and neuronal Src family kinases (SFKs). This leads to the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which is required for the phosphorylation of LIM kinase1 (LIMK) at threonine 508 through unknown upstream regulators (dotted arrow). The subsequent phosphorylation at serine 3 renders n-cofilin unable to depolymerize F-actin, thereby contributing to stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton in the leading processes of migrating neurons in the developing cortical plate (Fig. 4). This pathway is primarily mediated by ApoER2, whose genetic ablation blocks Reelin-dependent phosphorylation of cofilin, whereas the second Reelin lipoprotein receptor, VLDLR, seems to be dispensable (Fig. 2\n, ). Other Reelin-induced signaling cascades that potentially modulate the actin cytoskeleton and microtubule stability include the activation of the small GTPase Rap1 and the inhibition of the Tau kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2), which involves the PI3K-dependent activation of the protein kinase Akt (Beffert et al., 2002; Ballif et al., 2004; Jossin and Goffinet, 2007). C3G, Crk SH3-binding guanine nucleotide-releasing protein; mTor, mammalian target of rapamycin.In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that cytoskeletal stabilization by n-cofilin phosphorylation may be a novel mechanism by which Reelin controls actin dynamics and the orientation of migrating neurons.This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (SFB 780 and SFB 592 to M.F., FO 223/6-1 to E.F., and BO 1806/3-1 to H.H.B.).

Regions high in neuronal activity, especially of the glutamatergic type, have high levels of cytochrome  oxidase (COX). Perturbations in neuronal activity affect the expressions of COX and glutamatergic NMDA receptor subunit 1 (NR1). The present study sought to test our hypothesis that the coupling extends to the transcriptional level, whereby NR1 and possibly other NR subunits and COX are coregulated by the same transcription factor, nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1), which regulates all COX subunit genes. By means of multiple approaches, including  analysis, electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays,  chromatin immunoprecipitation, promoter mutations, and real-time quantitative PCR, NRF-1 was found to functionally bind to the promoters of  (),  () and  subunit genes, but not of  and  genes.

However, silencing of NRF-1 with small interference RNA blocked the upregulation of , , and  induced by KCl, and overexpression of NRF-1 rescued these transcripts that were suppressed by TTX.

Thus, NRF-1 is an essential transcription factor critical in the coregulation of , , and , and coupling exists at the transcriptional level to ensure coordinated expressions of proteins important for synaptic transmission and energy metabolism.NMDA receptor (NR) is a major glutamate receptor type that has a unique ligand-gated calcium channel with voltage-dependent magnesium block, and it plays an important role in neuronal plasticity, learning, and memory by mediating most of the excitatory synaptic transmission in the CNS (Choi, 1988; Meguro et al., 1992; Mori and Mishina, 1995). NR function is dictated by its subunit composition (Monyer et al., 1994), made up of an essential NR1 subunit in combination with NR2 (A-D) and/or NR3 (A-B) subunits in a heterotetramer that provides functional molecular diversity (Dingledine et al., 1999). NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission is an integral part of neuronal activity, which is tightly coupled to energy metabolism (Wong-Riley, 1989). Neuronal activity that involves more excitatory depolarizing transmission has a greater energy demand, as membrane repolarization after depolarization requires ATP-dependent Na+/K+-ATPase to actively pump cations against their concentration and electrical gradients. Most of the ATP in neurons is derived from oxidative metabolism, and cytochrome  oxidase (COX) is a critical energy-generating enzyme (Wong-Riley, 1989). It is an integral protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane, catalyzing the final step of oxidative metabolism (Wikstr\u00f6m et al., 1981). Regions rich in COX have higher levels of glutamatergic and NMDA receptor-mediated synapses, and when excitatory transmission is suppressed, such as with tetrodotoxin (TTX)-induced impulse blockade, the level of COX as well as of NMDA receptor subunit 1 are reduced (Wong-Riley et al., 1998a,b). Changes in the level of neuronal activity thus induce a concomitant change in both COX and NMDA receptors. Is it possible that the same molecular mechanism regulates the transcriptional expression of both COX and glutamate receptors? The goal of the present study is to test for the existence of a common transcription factor that can play such a dual role. Nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) is a transcription factor recently found to functionally regulate all 13 subunits of COX (Dhar et al., 2008). Its role in the regulation of NMDA subunit genes is entirely unknown. The goal of the present study is to use multiple approaches to test our hypothesis that NRF-1 dually regulates the expressions of both COX and NMDA receptor subunits in neurons.All experiments were performed in accordance with the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Medical College of Wisconsin regulations. All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals and their suffering.Murine neuroblastoma N2a cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, CCL-131). Cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2.Rat primary cortical neurons were cultured as described previously (Ongwijitwat and Wong-Riley, 2005). Briefly, 1-d-old neonatal rat pups were killed by decapitation. Brains were removed from the skull and the meninges were removed. Visual cortical tissue was dissected, trypsinized, and triturated to release individual neurons. These primary cortical neurons were then plated in 35 mm poly-l-lysine-coated dishes at a density of 50,000 cells/dish. Cells were maintained in Neurobasal-A media supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen). Ara-C (Sigma) was added to the media to suppress the proliferation of glial cells.In silico  DNA sequences surrounding the transcription start points (TSPs) of NMDA receptor subunit genes (, , and -b for ,  and , respectively) were derived from the mouse genome database in GenBank, using Genomatix Gene2promoter software. These promoter sequences encompassed 1 kb upstream and up to 200 bps downstream (excluding protein-coding sequence) of the TSP of each gene analyzed. Computer-assisted search for putative NRF-1 core binding sequences \u201cGCGCAT/CGC\u201d or \u201cGCGCAG/CGC\u201d was conducted on each promoter sequence. Alignment of human, mouse, and rat promoter sequences was done as previously described, using the Genome VISTA genome alignment tool (Ongwijitwat and Wong-Riley, 2005). Murine  and  promoter sequences were compared with rat and human genomic sequences using a 5-bp calculation window. Regions of high homology and/or that contain known NRF-1 binding sites were compared for the conservation of NRF-1 binding.Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) to assay NRF-1 interactions with putative binding elements on all NMDA receptor subunit promoters were performed with methods as previously described (Dhar et al., 2008). Briefly, oligonucleotide probes with putative NRF-1 binding site on each promoter (Table 1, , , , and  subunits) based on  analysis were synthesized, annealed, and labeled by a Klenow fragment fill-in reaction with [32P]dATP (50 \u03bcCi/200 ng). Each labeled probe was incubated with 2 g of calf thymus DNA and 5 g of HeLa nuclear extract (Promega) and processed for EMSA. Supershift assays were also performed and, in each reaction, 1\u20131.5 \u03bcg of NRF-1-specific antibodies (polyclonal goat antibodies, gift from Dr. Richard Scarpulla, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL) were added to the probe/nuclear extract mixture and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. For competition, 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides were incubated with nuclear extract before adding labeled or nonspecific oligonucleotides. Shift reactions were loaded onto 4% polyacrylamide gel and run at 200 V for 2.5 h in 0.25\u00d7 TBE buffer. Results were visualized by autoradiography. Rat cytochrome  with NRF-1 binding site at position \u2212172 / \u2212147 was designed as previously described (Evans and Scarpulla, 1990) and used as a positive control. NRF-1 mutants with mutated sequences as shown in Table 1 were used as negative controls.EMSA probesChromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed similar to those previously described (Dhar et al., 2008). Briefly, 750,000 N2a cells were used for each immunoprecipitation and were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. ChIP assay kit (Upstate) was used with minor modifications. Following formaldehyde fixation, cells were resuspended in a swelling buffer (5 mm PIPES, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors added right before use) and homogenized 10 times in small pestle Dounce tissue homogenizer (7 ml). Nuclei were then isolated by centrifugation before being subjected to sonication. The sonicated lysate was immunoprecipitated with either 0.2 \u03bcg of NRF-1 polyclonal rabbit antibodies (a gift from Dr. Scarpulla) or 2 \u03bcg of anti-nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) p75 polyclonal goat antibodies (C20 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Semiquantitative PCR was performed using 1/20th of precipitated chromatin. Primers targeting promoter sequences near TSP of NMDA receptor subunit genes were designed (Table 2) using approaches as previously described (Ongwijitwat and Wong-Riley, 2005). Transcription factor B2 of mitochondria () promoter, previously found to be activated by NRF-1 in neurons (Dhar et al., 2008), was used as a positive control, and exon 5 of \u03b2-actin gene was used as a negative control (Table 2). PCRs were performed with the EX  hot-start polymerase (Takara Mirus Bio) with the following cycling parameters: 30 s denaturation at 94\u00b0C, 30 s annealing at 59.5\u00b0C, and 20 s extension at 72\u00b0C (32\u201336 cycles per reaction). All reactions were hot-started by heating to 94\u00b0C for 120 s. Use of hot-start polymerase and PCR additives significantly improved the quality and reproducibility of ChIP. PCR products were visualized on 2% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide.ChIP assay primersPCR cloning primersPrimers for real-time PCRLuciferase reporter constructs of NR1 promoters were made by PCR cloning the proximal promoter sequences using genomic DNA prepared from mouse N2a cells as template, digesting with I and dIII, and ligating the product directionally into  (Promega). Sequences of primers used for PCR cloning and mutagenesis primers are provided in Table 3. Subunit  clone was used from our previous study (Dhar et al., 2008). Site-directed mutations of putative NRF-1 binding site on each promoter were generated using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All constructs were verified by sequencing.Each promoter construct was transfected into N2a cells in a 24-well plate using Lipofectamine 2000. Each well received 0.6 \u03bcg of reporter construct and 0.03 \u03bcg of pCMV\u03b2gal, which constitutively expressed \u03b2-galactosidase. Transfected neurons were stimulated with KCl at a final concentration of 20 mm in the culture media for 5 h as previously described (Yang et al., 2006). After 5 h of treatment, cell lysates were harvested and measured for luciferase activity as described previously (Dhar et al., 2008). Data from six independent transfections were averaged for each promoter construct.The  vector with U6 promoter and puromycin resistance (Addgene) was used to express murine NRF-1 small hairpin RNA (shRNA) (GenBank accession no. for NRF-1: NM_010938). Four shRNA sequences were selected and constructed with a common, noncoding, hairpin loop region (TTCAAGAGA): 5\u2032-GAAAGCTGCAAGCCTATCT-3\u2032; 5\u2032-GCCACAGGAGGTTAATTCA-3\u2032; 5\u2032-GCATTACGGACCATAGTTA-3\u2032; and 5\u2032-AGAGCATGATCCTGGAAGA-3\u2032.Empty vectors and scrambled shRNA served as negative controls. A green fluorescent protein-containing reporter vector  (a gift from Dr. P. Aebischer, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland) was used to identify transfected N2a cells and primary neurons. The basic gene cloning method was followed and as described previously (Ongwijitwat and Wong-Riley, 2006). To determine the effect of silencing NRF-1 expression on endogenous targets, N2a cells or primary neurons were plated in 35 mm dishes at a density of 5\u20138 \u00d7 106 cells/dish. Cells were cotransfected 3 d postplating with either 4 \u03bcg of the shRNA plasmids (four sequences at equal amounts) or 4 \u03bcg of the empty vector and 1.5 \u03bcg of  vector (for primary neurons, 0.25 \u03bcg of the shRNA plasmids and 1 \u03bcg of  vector), using Lipofectamine 2000 as described previously (Ongwijitwat and Wong-Riley, 2006; Dhar et al., 2008). Puromycin at a final concentration of 0.5 \u03bcg/ml was added to the culture medium on the second day after transfection to select for purely transfected cells. Green fluorescence was observed to monitor transfection efficiency. Transfection efficiency for N2a cells ranged from 40 to 75%, while that for primary cortical neurons was from 40 to 60%. However, puromycin selection effectively yielded 100% of transfected cells. N2a cells transfected with shRNA against NRF-1 were further stimulated with KCl at a final concentration of 20 mm in the culture media for 5 h as previously described (Yang et al., 2006). After 5 h of treatment, cells were harvested for RNA isolation.Total RNA was isolated by RNeasy kits (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three micrograms of total RNA was treated with DNase I and purified by phenol-chloroform. cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primers and SuperScript II RNase H-Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Real-time quantitative PCRs were performed in a Cepheid Smart Cycler Detection system (Cepheid). SyBr Green (BioWhittaker Molecular Application) and EX  real-time quantitative PCR hot-start polymerase were used following the manufacturer's protocols and as described previously (Dhar et al., 2008). Primer sequences are shown in Table 4. PCR runs: hot start 2 min at 95\u00b0C, denaturation 10 s at 95\u00b0C, annealing 15 s according to the m of each primer, and extension 10 s at 72\u00b0C for 15\u201330 cycles. Melt curve analyses verified the formation of single desired PCR product. Mouse \u03b2-actin for N2a cells and rat 18 s for primary neurons were used as internal controls, and the \u0394\u0394T method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001) was performed for the relative amount of transcripts.Control and NRF-1 shRNA samples were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE gel and electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Subsequent to blocking, blots were incubated in primary antibodies [polyclonal antibodies against NRF-1 (1:500; a gift from Dr. Scarpulla,), NR1 (1:200), NR2A (1:200), NR2B (1:200) (all from Millipore)], or NR3A (1:200; P20 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Monoclonal antibodies against \u03b2-actin (Sigma) at 1:3000 dilution were used as loading controls. Blots were then incubated in secondary antibodies (goat-anti-rabbit, goat-anti-mouse, or rabbit-anti-goat; Millipore), reacted with ECL, and exposed to autoradiographic film (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Quantitative analyses of relative changes were done with an Alpha Imager (Alpha Innotech). plasmid (a gift from Dr. Scarpulla) was used for NRF-1 overexpression. N2a cells and primary neurons were each plated in 35 mm dishes at a density of 2\u20135 \u00d7 105 cells/dish. N2a cells were cotransfected 3 d postplating with either 2.5 \u03bcg of the  plasmid or an empty vector plus 0.5 \u03bcg of  vector, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at a 1:3 ratio. Procedures were identical for the transfection of primary neurons, except that 2 \u03bcg  plasmid were used. Puromycin at a final concentration of 0.5 \u03bcg/ml was added on the second day after transfection to select for purely transfected cells. After 1 d of overexpression, TTX at a final concentration of 0.4 \u03bcm was added to the culture media for 3 d. N2a cells and primary neurons were harvested on the fourth day for RNA isolation.Significance among group means was determined by ANOVA. Significance between two groups was analyzed by Student's  test.  values of 0.05 or less were considered significant.Proximal promoters of murine NR subunit genes with DNA sequence 1 kb 5\u2032 upstream and 100 bps beyond 3\u2032 of TSPs were analyzed  for potential NRF-1 binding sites (Table 1).  () and  () promoters showed atypical sequence for NRF-1 binding but had the invariant GCA core described previously for  subunit genes (Dhar et al., 2008), whereas  () had atypical NRF-1 site lacking the GCA core. Other NMDA receptor subunits  (),  () and  () also had atypical NRF-1 binding sites without the GCA core.  lacked both typical and atypical NRF-1 binding sites, and was used as a negative control in subsequent studies. EMSAs were performed using 32P-labeled probes (Table 1) to determine the specificity of NRF-1 binding to promoters of murine NR subunits (, , and ), with  as the negative control (Fig. 1). Rat cytochrome  promoter with NRF-1 site on positions \u2212172 / \u2212147 served as a positive control (Dhar et al., 2008), and it formed specific DNA/NRF-1 shift and supershift complexes (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 5, respectively). When an excess of unlabeled probe was added as a competitor, no shift band was formed (Fig. 1, lane 4). However, an excess of unlabeled mutant NRF-1 probes did not prevent the formation of a shift complex (Fig. 1, lane 3). To rule out any nonspecific antibody-oligonucleotide interactions, labeled oligonucleotides were incubated with NRF-1 antibody without HeLa nuclear extract, and no shift bands were observed (Fig. 1, lane 2; Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 6). As shown in Figure 1,  and  promoters formed specific DNA-protein shift complexes when incubated with purified HeLa nuclear extract (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 7, respectively). Competition with excess unlabeled probes eliminated these complexes (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 8), whereas the addition of mutant NRF-1 probes had no effect (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 9). A supershift band was produced when anti-NRF-1 antibodies were added to shift assays of  and , respectively (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 10, respectively).  and  mutant NRF-1 probes yielded no band or complexes (Fig. 1, lanes 13 and 14).  and  lacked NRF-1 binding sites and did not produce any shift bands (Fig. 1, lanes 11 and 12), verifying that the presence of the GCA core is essential for NRF-1 binding. and  interactions between NRF-1 and NMDA receptor subunit genes and promoter mutational analyses. , , EMSAs for NRF-1. 32P-labeled oligonucleotides (specific to each promoter tested), excess unlabeled oligos (specific to each promoter) as competitors, excess unlabeled mutant NRF-1 (mutating NRF-1 site for each promoter) as competitors, HeLa extract, and NRF-1 antibodies are indicated by a plus (+) or a minus (\u2212) sign. Arrowheads indicate NRF-1 shift and supershift complexes. The positive control, cytochrome  (), shows shift (, lane 1) and supershift (, lane 5) bands, while excess unlabeled competitors did not yield any band (, lane 4).  and  subunits have specific shift (, lanes 2 and 7) and supershift (, lanes 5 and 10) bands that are eliminated by excess unlabeled competitors (, lanes 3 and 8), while  and  had no bands (, lanes 11 and 12). Labeled mutated NRF-1 site on  and  were negative controls (, lanes 13 and 14, respectively). Excess unlabeled and mutated NRF-1 sites could not compete (, lane 3; , lanes 4, 9). Labeled oligos with NRF-1 antibodies alone did not yield any band (, lane 2; , lanes 1, 6). , ChIP assays. Input lanes represent 0.5% and 0.1% of chromatin.  promoter was the positive control and \u03b2-actin was the negative control.  and  promoters coimmunoprecipitated with NRF-1, while  and  did not. Anti-nerve growth factor receptor p75 antibodies (NGFR) represent a negative control. , Site-directed mutations (Mut) of NRF-1 binding sites on promoters of , , and  (one of the 10 nuclear-encoded COX subunits) resulted in significant reductions in luciferase activity compared with the wild type (wt). ( = 6 for each construct). * < 0.05, ** < 0.001.ChIP assays were performed to verify NRF-1 interactions with NMDA receptor subunits . \u03b2-Actin exon 5 served as a negative control, whereas transcription factor B2 of mitochondria () with a known NRF-1 binding site (Gleyzer et al., 2005; Dhar et al., 2008) served as a positive control. Parallel immunoprecipitation assays were performed with the same N2a cell lysates and NRF-1 antibodies. Anti-nerve growth factor receptor p75 antibodies (NGFR) served as a negative immunoprecipitation control. PCRs using primers shown in Table 2 were done to determine which promoters interacted with NRF-1 . Individual 0.5 and 0.1% dilutions of input chromatin were used as standards to indicate the efficiency of the PCRs (Fig. 1). , , and  each produced a band from DNA coimmunoprecipitated with anti-NRF-1 antibodies at a position identical to that from the genomic DNA control (input) (Fig. 1). However, , , and \u03b2-actin yielded no bands (Fig. 1). In all cases, coimmunoprecipitation with NGFR antibodies did not yield any PCR product.Based on EMSA probes (Table 1) that formed NRF-1 specific complexes (Fig. 1,), site-directed mutations of these same putative NRF-1 binding sites on ,  and murine  promoters were constructed (Table 3), generated in luciferase reporter plasmids, and analyzed by gene transfection. As shown in Figure 1, mutation of NRF-1 binding sites led to \u223c35\u201360% reduction in promoter activity of , , and  genes ( < 0.05\u20130.001).  subunit promoter served as a positive control and confirmed our previous report (Dhar et al., 2008).To determine the effect of silencing NRF-1 transcript on the expression of NMDA receptors, plasmid vectors expressing small hairpin RNA (shRNA) against four target sequences of NRF-1 mRNA were used. These vectors were previously found to silence NRF-1 expression in N2a cells (Dhar et al., 2008). Transfection of neurons with shRNA vectors resulted in \u223c70\u201380% decrease in levels of NRF-1, NR1, and NR2B proteins as measured by Western blots ( < 0.05\u20130.01) (Fig. 2). However, NR2A and NR3A showed no alterations in protein levels (Fig. 2). cDNAs from N2a cells (Fig. 2) and primary cortical neurons (Fig. 2) transfected with NRF-1 shRNA vectors, scrambled shRNA vectors, or empty vectors were analyzed with quantitative real-time PCRs. As shown in Figure 2,  and , mRNA levels of NRF-1, Grin1, Grin2b, COX2 (mitochondrial-encoded) and COX6c (nuclear-encoded) were significantly reduced in both N2a cells and primary neurons transfected with shRNA compared with those transfected with empty vectors. The extent of reduction ranged between 65 and 80% ( < 0.05\u20130.01). However, the expressions of Grin2a, Grin3a, and nuclear respiratory factor 2\u03b1 (NRF-2\u03b1, a negative control) remained unchanged. The scrambled shRNA also did not have any effect on any mRNA level tested (Fig. 2,).RNA interference-mediated silencing of NRF-1 suppresses mRNAs in NMDAR subunit genes and COX genes. , Western blot reveals a downregulation of NRF-1, NR1, and NR2B protein levels in shRNA-transfected neurons, whereas NR2A and NR3A protein levels were not affected. \u03b2-Actin served as a loading control. , , N2a cells and primary neurons were transfected with shRNA against NRF-1 (light bars) or with empty vectors (black bars) or with scrambled shRNA (gray bars). NRF-2\u03b1 served as a negative control. , , ,  (mitochondrial-encoded), and  (nuclear-encoded) subunit mRNAs show significant decreases in shRNA-treated samples compared with those with empty vectors, whereas , , and \u03b1 mRNAs remained unchanged.  = 6 for each data point. ** < 0.01, *** < 0.001.To determine if the expressions of  and  genes in N2a cells responded directly to depolarizing stimulation, cells were subjected to 20 mm of potassium chloride for 5 h, a regimen previously found to activate NRF-1 and COX gene expressions in primary neurons (Zhang and Wong-Riley, 2000a; Liang and Wong-Riley, 2006; Liang et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2006). As shown in Figure 3 for primary neurons, depolarizing stimulation resulted in a significant increase in the expressions of , , , , and  genes, as monitored by real-time quantitative PCR ( < 0.05\u20130.001). The increase ranged from 50 to 90%.Depolarization-induced upregulation of mRNA levels and promoter gene expressions of NMDAR and COX subunits in neurons and the effects of NRF-1 silencing or binding site mutation. , KCl depolarization induced an upregulation of , , , , and  in primary neurons analyzed with real-time quantitative PCR. * < 0.05, ** < 0.01, *** < 0.001 compared with controls. , Comparable results as in  were obtained in N2a cells. NRF-1 silencing with shRNA prevented the upregulation of these transcripts by KCl.  and  were also upregulated by KCl, indicating a general stimulatory effect of KCl on neurons. However, NRF-1 silencing did not prohibit these transcripts from being induced by KCl, as their levels are significantly different from controls, but are not different from those of KCl alone. * < 0.05 compared with controls. All # values (< 0.05) were compared with 20 mm KCl alone. Values in  and  each represent mean \u00b1 SEM of combined data from three independent experiments. , Site-directed mutations (mut) of NRF-1 binding sites on  and  promoters resulted in a significant reduction in luciferase activity compared with their wild-type (wt) controls. KCl depolarization increased promoter activity in the wild type but not in mutated  and . ( = 6 for each construct). * < 0.05, ** < 0.01 compared with  and  wild type. X =  < 0.01 compared with  and  wt with KCl depolarization.To investigate the response of NMDAR and COX subunit genes to KCl after NRF-1 silencing, N2a cells transfected with shRNA against NRF-1 were subjected to 20 mm of KCl for 5 h. As shown in Figure 3, depolarizing stimulation without gene silencing resulted in a significant increase in the expressions of , ,  and  genes, as monitored by real-time quantitative PCR ( < 0.05). The increase ranged from 140 to 170%, indicating that KCl has a general stimulatory effect on transcription (at least of the genes tested). However, in the presence of NRF-1 silencing, mRNA levels of  and  and  were not upregulated by KCl. However, NRF-1 silencing did not prevent  and  from being upregulated by KCl, and their levels remained higher than those of controls ( < 0.05) but not different from those with KCl alone. These results confirmed the specificity of NRF-1 in the regulation of , , and  subunits in response to increased neuronal activity.To further verify that NRF-1 binding is necessary for the upregulation of  and  transcripts in the presence of KCl, these binding sites were mutated in  and  promoters (Table 3). As shown in Figure 3 for N2a cells, mutation of NRF-1 sites severely downregulated the expression of  and  genes, as monitored by luciferase assays, and prevented their upregulation by KCl.A low concentration of TTX (0.4 \u03bcm) has been shown to decrease levels of  subunit mRNAs as well as COX enzyme activity  and in primary neurons (Wong-Riley et al., 1998a,b; Liang et al., 2006). To determine if overexpression of NRF-1 could rescue not only  but also  transcripts, a  construct (a gift from Dr. Scarpulla) for NRF-1 overexpression was transfected into primary neurons that were then exposed to TTX (0.4 \u03bcm) for 3 d. When neurons were transfected with empty vectors, exposure to TTX led to a 60\u201380% reduction in mRNA levels of , , , , and  (Fig. 4), indicating an overall suppressive effect of TTX on gene expressions in neurons. Neurons transfected with the  construct over-expressing NRF-1 had a 700% increase in NRF-1 mRNAs ( < 0.001) (Fig. 4) and a 70\u201385% increase in message levels of , , , and  (Fig. 4) compared with empty vector controls ( < 0.05\u20130.01). However, there was no change in  and  mRNA levels with NRF-1 overexpression (Fig. 4,). When exposed to TTX, neurons transfected with NRF-1 expressed 60% more  mRNA and 30\u201360% more , , and  transcripts compared with those with empty vectors ( < 0.05\u20130.001), but the levels of  and  remained low and not different from those transfected with empty vectors and exposed to TTX. These results confirmed that NRF-1 could rescue , , and , but not  and  mRNA levels, from being downregulated by TTX.NRF-1 overexpression in primary neurons significantly increased mRNA levels for , and  genes and rescued them from TTX-induced suppression. , , , , and  mRNA levels () were all reduced by TTX compared with controls, indicating a generalized depressive effect of TTX on neurons. Overexpression of NRF-1 significantly increased transcript levels of , , and , but not of  and . Overexpression of NRF-1 was able to rescue , , and  but not  and  transcripts from being downregulated by TTX. ( = 6 for each group). All * values were compared with empty vectors (* < 0.05, ** < 0.01, *** < 0.001). All # values were compared with empty vector + TTX (# < 0.05, ## < 0.01, ### < 0.001), and all X values were compared with NRF-1 overexpression (X < 0.05, XXX < 0.001).The sequences of murine  and  subunit genes were aligned with homologous regions in the rat and human genomes to determine if NRF-1 binding sites tested in the present study were conserved in other species. Results showed a high degree of homology (60\u2013100%) among the three species (Fig. 5). Thus, NRF-1 sites are highly conserved among mice, rats, and humans.Aligned partial sequences of  and  promoters from rat (R), mouse (M), and human (H) genomes indicate conservation of atypical NRF-1 binding sites. Conserved binding site sequences are in boldface. Solid boxes highlight NRF-1 sites that are highly conserved in all three or at least two species. The underlined GCA is an invariant sequence for NRF-1 binding for  (this study) and for  (Dhar et al., 2008) promoters.The present study documents for the first time that NMDA receptor subunits 1 and 2b and COX subunit genes are regulated by the same transcription factor, NRF-1, thus linking glutamatergic synaptic transmission and energy metabolism at the transcriptional level of regulation (Fig. 6). The high homology for NRF-1 binding sites among mice, rats, and humans for  and  (Fig. 5) as well as for  subunit promoters (Dhar et al., 2008) underscores the conservation of such coregulation through evolution. NRF-1 itself is activated at both protein and mRNA levels by depolarizing neuronal activity (Yang et al., 2006), and it, in turn, coordinates the transcriptional activation of both NMDA receptor and COX subunit genes, thus ensuring that neuronal activity (or at least one major aspect of it) and energy metabolism remain tightly coupled.Schematic representation showing the coregulation of two tightly coupled processes: neuronal activity and energy metabolism. Glutamatergic synaptic transmission and energy metabolism are regulated by a common transcriptional regulator. Specifically, NMDA receptor subunits  and  and all  subunit genes are regulated by the same transcription factor, NRF-1.Most native NMDA receptors function as heterotetrameric assemblies composed of two glycine-binding NR1 and two glutamate-binding NR2 subunits (Chen and Wyllie, 2006). NR2A and NR2B subunits are required for the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the nucleus accumbens (Schotanus and Chergui, 2008). NR2C and NR2D are mainly embryonic, although they are reportedly still expressed at low levels in the adult cortex (Monyer et al., 1994; Goebel and Poosch, 1999). Likewise, NR3A and 3B are primarily embryonic, although a switch from NR2A to NR3B has been reported in motoneurons during early postnatal development (Eriksson et al., 2002; Fukaya et al., 2005). In the adult cortex and hippocampus, the majority of NMDA receptors are composed of NR1/NR2A/NR2B subunits (Chazot and Stephenson, 1997; Luo et al., 1997). In isolation, NR1 () gene expresses a functional receptor with a weak response activated by glutamate and glycine, whereas none of the NR2 () subunits is functional when expressed alone (Moriyoshi et al., 1991). An increasing number of reports have demonstrated the importance of the NR2B subunit in a variety of synaptic signaling events and protein-protein interactions. The NR2B subunit has been implicated in modulating functions such as learning, memory processing, pain perception, and feeding behaviors, as well as being involved in a number of human disorders (Babb et al., 2005). The NR2B subunit appears to be critical for a number of basic structural and functional attributes associated with the NMDA receptor. The formation of heteromeric NR1\u2013NR2B receptors in the rat occurs primarily at birth and increases postnatally compared with the development of either homomeric NR1 or NR2B receptors due to disturbances during the critical prenatal period (E14\u2013P0). This suggests that the NR1\u2013NR2B receptor complex may play a significant role in postnatal synaptic transmission and rearrangements, such as for specialized receptors, higher affinities, synapse eliminations, and segregations (Loftis and Janowsky, 2003; Babb et al., 2005). The present finding of a coregulation of  and  ( and ) by NRF-1 is consistent with a functional NR1-NR2B complex and that this complex is potentially regulated concurrently with mitochondrial energy-generating enzymes. Other transcription factor binding sites have been reported for NMDA receptor subunit promoters, such as for  in humans, rats and chicks (Zimmer et al., 1995; Krainc et al., 1998; Zarain-Herzberg et al., 2005),  in rats (Liu et al., 2003), and  and  in rats (Goebel and Poosch, 1999). These include SP1 and MAZ binding sites, which reportedly enhanced  promoter activity during neuronal differentiation of the P19 cell line (Okamoto et al., 2002). However, their roles in primary neurons were entirely unknown. The present study documents for the first time the functional role that NRF-1 plays in regulating NMDA receptor subunit genes in primary neurons subjected to depolarizing stimulation and TTX blockade. Silencing of NRF-1 prohibited  and  from being upregulated by KCl, whereas overexpression of NRF-1 rescued these transcripts from being downregulated by TTX. Thus, NRF-1 functionally regulates critical NMDA receptor subunit genes in response to changing neuronal activity.NRF-1 is known to be a key transcriptional activator of nuclear genes encoding a number of mitochondrial respiratory enzymes, including subunits of the five respiratory chain complexes (Scarpulla, 2002, 2006, 2008). Recently, we found that NRF-1 regulates all 10 nuclear-encoded  subunit genes in neurons (Dhar et al., 2008). In addition, NRF-1 is necessary for the activation of mitochondrial transcription factor A (), transcription specificity factors ( and ), and RNA-processing proteins required for mtDNA transcription and replication (Virbasius and Scarpulla, 1994; Gleyzer et al., 2005). The polycistronic mitochondrial transcript gives rise to 13 polypeptides, three of which form the catalytic core of cytochrome  oxidase enzyme (Wong-Riley et al., 1998c). Thus, NRF-1 regulates all 13 subunits of COX from the two genomes. It is vital for mitochondrial biogenesis, for normal cell growth, and cellular functioning (Scarpulla, 2006, 2008). Silencing of NRF-1 in the present study downregulates both mitochondrial-encoded (COX2) and nuclear-encoded (COX6c) transcripts and prevented their upregulation by KCl. However, overexpression of NRF-1 rescues both transcripts from being severely decreased by TTX. These findings reaffirm the significant role that NRF-1 plays in regulating COX gene expression in neurons (Dhar et al., 2008).Previously, we found that the level of COX activity in rat primary neuronal cultures, monkey retina, and monkey visual cortex under normal conditions are positively correlated with the intensity of distribution of excitatory neurotransmitters and their receptors, such as glutamate and NMDA receptor subunit NR1 (Nie and Wong-Riley, 1996; Wong-Riley et al., 1998a,b; Zhang and Wong-Riley, 2000b). This is consistent with the fact that repolarization after excitation-induced depolarization is highly energy-dependent and consumes the bulk of ATP produced in the CNS (Wong-Riley, 1989). Under conditions of altered neuronal activity, such as afferent impulse blockade by TTX or depolarizing treatment by KCl, neuronal COX activity is adjusted to match the new energy demand (Wong-Riley, 1989; Zhang and Wong-Riley, 2000a), and such regulation is mainly at the transcriptional level (Wong-Riley et al., 1998b). Changes in neuronal activity likewise affect the expression of glutamate and NMDA receptors (Wong-Riley et al., 1998a,b; this study). Having concurrent regulation of both COX and NMDA receptors at the transcriptional level by the same transcription factor, as assessed by the present study, substantially escalates the efficiency of this regulatory process.In conclusion, the present study has come full circle in documenting the tight coupling between neuronal activity and energy metabolism beyond the cellular level (Wong-Riley, 1989) to the molecular level. This tight coupling can be initiated and/or maintained at the transcriptional level by having the same transcription factor participate in the regulation of both processes (Fig. 6). NRF-1 can effectively coordinate the expressions of both NMDA receptor and COX subunit genes, thereby orchestrating a smooth and constant interplay between energy consumption of synaptic transmission and energy generation. No doubt, NRF-1 may not act alone. NRF-2, for example, has also been shown to regulate all 13 COX subunits from the two genomes (Ongwijitwat and Wong-Riley, 2005; Ongwijitwat et al., 2006), and the possibility that it may also regulate NMDA receptor subunit genes has yet to be explored. In addition, a transcriptional coactivator, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 coactivator 1 (PGC-1), is known to stimulate a powerful induction of both NRF-1 and NRF-2 (Gleyzer et al., 2005) as well as bind to and coactivate NRF-1 in stimulating  expression (Wu et al., 1999). PGC-1 has been shown to respond swiftly to external cues in non-neuronal cells (Puigserver et al., 2001) and to changing activity in primary neurons (Liang et al., 2006; Meng et al., 2007). The transcriptional machinery for coregulating neuronal activity and energy metabolism is likely to involve all of these critical factors.This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant EY018441.

They were identified in wild-type mice by specific antibodies or in transgenic mouse lines by specific expression of green fluorescent protein or Clomeleon. The bipolar cell densities, their cone contacts, their dendritic coverage, and their axonal tiling were measured in retinal whole mounts. The results show that each and all cones are contacted by at least one member of any given type of bipolar cell (not considering genuine blue cones). Consequently, each cone feeds its light signals into a minimum of 10 different bipolar cells. Parallel processing of an image projected onto the retina, therefore, starts at the first synapse of the retina, the cone pedicle. The quantitative analysis suggests that our proposed catalog of 11 cone bipolar cells and one rod bipolar cell is complete, and all major bipolar cell types of the mouse retina appear to have been discovered.Bipolar cells transfer the light signals from the photoreceptors (cones and rods) to amacrine and ganglion cells. There are at least nine morphological types of cone bipolar (CB) and one type of rod bipolar (RB) cells in the mammalian retina. They differ in their dendritic branching pattern, the number of cones contacted, and the shape and stratification level of their axons in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) (Masland, 2001; W\u00e4ssle, 2004, 2008).Functionally, bipolar cells can be subdivided, according to their light responses, into ON and OFF bipolar cells (Kolb and Nelson, 1995; Euler et al., 1996; Hartveit, 1997; DeVries, 2000). This functional dichotomy is the result of the expression of different glutamate receptors (GluRs) at the synapses between photoreceptors and bipolar cell dendrites (Nomura et al., 1994; Brandst\u00e4tter et al., 1997; DeVries, 2000; Hack et al., 1999, 2001; Haverkamp et al., 2001).The morphological classification of bipolar cells has been made more objective and more quantitative by immunocytochemical markers that selectively label specific cell types. Protein kinase C (PKC\u03b1) has been found to be expressed by RB cells (Negishi et al., 1988; Greferath et al., 1990). During recent years, several immunocytochemical markers of CB cells have been identified, such as antibodies against calcium binding proteins (CaB5, calbindin, recoverin, or calsenilin), transmitter receptors (neurokinin receptors NK1R and NK3R), membrane channels (hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide gated channels HCN1\u2013HCN4), cell adhesion molecules (cluster of differentiation CD15), or synaptic vesicle proteins (synaptotagmin).More recently, expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of specific promoters has been observed in specific types of bipolar cells of the mouse retina. All ON bipolar cells were labeled with GFP driven by the mGluR6 (metabotropic glutamate receptor 6) promoter (Dhingra et al., 2008). Type 7 cone bipolar cells expressed GFP under the control of the gustducin promoter (Gus\u2013GFP) (Huang et al., 2003). Blue cone bipolar cells expressed Clomeleon (Clm) driven by the  promoter (Haverkamp et al., 2005; Berglund et al., 2006).It was the aim of the present study to define and apply selective markers for all nine morphological types of cone bipolar cells of the mouse retina (Ghosh et al., 2004). The markers were antibodies and/or specific expression of fluorescent proteins in transgenic mouse lines. With the exception of Type 8 cells, we were able to define such markers for all bipolar cells and study, in retinal whole mounts, their cone contacts, densities, and axonal patterns. The dendritic overlap (coverage) of neighboring bipolar cells of the same type is small (coverage smaller than 2). However, a given cone, not considering true/genuine blue cones, is contacted by at least one bipolar cell of any given type. The sum of the bipolar cell densities measured here for the individual types is in close agreement with the total bipolar cell density reported by Jeon et al. (1998). The set of bipolar cells described in the present study appears, therefore, complete, meaning that no major class of mouse bipolar cells seems to be missing.Wild-type mice (C57BL/6J) and the following transgenic mouse lines were used. Two mouse lines (genetic background C57BL/6J), Clm1 and Clm12, expressed Clomeleon, a genetically encoded ratiometric fluorescent indicator for [Cl\u2212] under the  promoter (Feng et al., 2000; Berglund et al., 2006). One mouse line (genetic background C57BL/6J) expressed GFP under the gustducin promoter (Wong et al., 1999; Huang et al., 2003). One mouse line (genetic background C57BL/6NCrl) expressed enhanced GFP (EGFP) under the control of the serotonin 3 receptor (5-HT3R) (Haverkamp et al., 2009). The mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and killed by cervical dislocation. All procedures were approved by the local animal care committee and were in accordance with the law of animal experimentation issued by the German Government (Tierschutzgesetz). The eyes were removed and dissected, and the posterior eye cup containing the retina was immediately immersed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 15\u201330 min. After fixation, the retina was dissected from the eyecup. For frozen sections, it was cryoprotected in graded sucrose solutions (10, 20, and 30% w/v, respectively), and cryostat sections were cut at 14 \u03bcm, mounted, and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. For retinal whole mounts, the tissue was cryoprotected and frozen and thawed several times. Whole mounts were processed free floating.Clomeleon consists of Topaz, a variant of the yellow fluorescent protein and cyan fluorescent protein fused together. Hence, it is already visible without immunostaining because of its green/yellow fluorescence. However, by applying antibodies against GFP, the fluorescence signal was substantially increased: rabbit anti-GFP (1:2000; Invitrogen) and mouse anti-GFP (1:500; Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents). The same antibodies were also used for the amplification of GFP and EGFP signals. Cone pedicles were labeled with a guinea pig antiserum against glycogen phosphorylase (glypho) (1:1000) (Pfeiffer-Guglielmi et al., 2003) (kind gift from B. Hamprecht and B. Pfeiffer-Guglielmi, University of T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany) and with a goat antibody against GluR5C (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), which is expressed at the dendritic tips of OFF bipolar cells (Haverkamp et al., 2003). The layering within the inner plexiform layer was revealed by a mouse monoclonal antibody against calretinin (1:2000; Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents). Horizontal cells were labeled with a rabbit antibody against calbindin (CaBP, 1:2000; Swant). Cholinergic amacrine cells were immunostained with a goat antibody against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) (1:2000; Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents).We used the following immunocytochemical markers for mouse bipolar cells (Fig. 1): anti-NK3R (rabbit, polyclonal, 1:500; kind gift from A. Hirano, Geffen School of Medicine at University of Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA) for Type 1/2 bipolar cells (Haverkamp et al., 2003; Ghosh et al., 2004; Pignatelli and Strettoi, 2004; Chang et al., 2006); anti-HCN4 (rabbit, polyclonal, 1:500; Alomone Labs) for Type 3a bipolar cells (Mataruga et al., 2007); anti-protein kinase A, regulatory subunit II\u03b2 (PKARII\u03b2) (mouse, monoclonal, 1:3000; BD Biosciences) for Type 3b bipolar cells (Mataruga et al., 2007); anti-calsenilin (mouse, monoclonal, 1:2000; kind gift from W. Wasco, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA) for Type 4 bipolar cells (Haverkamp et al., 2008); and anti-synaptotagmin II (Syt2 or ZNP-1; mouse, monoclonal, 1:200; Zebrafish International Resource Center, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR) for Type 2 (Fox and Sanes, 2007) and Type 6 bipolar cells (described herein).Bipolar cell types of the mouse retina (Ghosh et al., 2004) and the markers and transgenic mouse lines used in the present study. Csen, Calsenilin. For details, see Materials and Methods.Antibodies were diluted in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.5\u20131% Triton X-100 and 0.05% sodium azide with either 3% normal donkey serum or 5% Chemiblocker (Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents) or without a blocking substance in the case of NK3R staining. Immunocytochemical labeling was performed using the indirect fluorescence method. Cryostat sections were incubated overnight in the primary antibodies, followed by incubation (1 h) in the secondary antibodies, which were conjugated to Alexa TM 488 (green fluorescence; Invitrogen), cyanine 3 (red fluorescence; Dianova), or cyanine 5 (dark red fluorescence). In double-labeling experiments, sections were incubated in a mixture of primary antibodies, followed by a mixture of secondary antibodies. Whole mounts were incubated for 2 d in the primary and for 2 h in the secondary antibody solution. The Alexa 594-conjugated lectin peanut agglutinin (PNA) (Invitrogen) was used at a 1:200 concentration, and whole mounts were incubated for 2 h.Fluorescent specimens were viewed with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope with a fluorescent filter set that was wedge corrected, i.e., shifting from one filter to the other did not introduce displacements. Black-and-white images were taken by using a cooled CCD camera (AxioCam Mrm; Zeiss). By using the Zeiss AxioVision 4.2 software, images taken with the different fluorescence filters were pseudocolored and superimposed. The microscope was equipped with the Zeiss Apotome oscillating grating in the epifluorescence beam, which resulted in a significant reduction of out-of-focus stray light. Images were taken with a Plan-Neofluar 63\u00d7/1.4 oil-immersion objective as stacks of up to 30 optical sections taken from the cone pedicles to the bipolar cell axon terminals. The cone contacts, dendritic trees, and axon terminals were analyzed by looking through the individual sections. Density measurements were made by collapsing selected parts of the stacks into a single plane. Confocal micrographs were taken using a Zeiss LSM Pascal fluorescence microscope equipped with an argon and a helium/neon laser. High-resolution scanning was performed with a Plan-Apochromate 63\u00d7/1.4 objective. Usually, a stack of 12 sections was taken from the inner nuclear layer (INL) to the outer plexiform layer (OPL) (-axis step size, 0.6 \u03bcm). Another stack was taken afterward from the INL to the axon terminals.The densities of cone pedicles and bipolar cells were always measured in the same retinal fields that were double labeled for a cone pedicle marker (PNA, glypho, or GluR5) and a type-selective bipolar cell marker. Usually, \u223c10 fields (141 \u03bcm long and 106 \u03bcm wide) were analyzed. They were sampled from different eccentricities and from two or three different retinal whole mounts. For each field, the cone density, the bipolar cell density, and the ratio of cone density to bipolar cell density were measured. The arithmetic means of the measurements are listed in Table 1. The numbers of cones contacted by an individual bipolar cell were measured from well isolated individual bipolar cells and are shown by frequency histograms.Comparison of the cone and bipolar cell densitiesThe brightness and the contrast of the final images were adjusted using Photoshop 5.5 (Adobe Systems).Because it is known that various mouse strains differ with respect to allelic variants that control nerve cell numbers, we compared in preliminary experiments retinal cell densities of C57BL/6J (purchased from The Jackson Laboratory) and C57BL/6NCrl (purchased from Charles River Laboratories). Retinal whole mounts were triple stained for PNA to reveal cone pedicles, calbindin to label horizontal cells, and ChAT to stain OFF and ON cholinergic amacrine cells. It had been shown that the densities of these cells vary in different mouse strains (Raven et al., 2005; Reese et al., 2005; Keeley et al., 2007; Whitney et al., 2008). Supplemental Figure 1 (available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) shows labeled cone pedicles, horizontal cells, and OFF and ON cholinergic amacrine cells in retinal whole mounts. The following densities (cells per square millimeter) were measured from eight fields (four peripheral and four central): C57BL/6J mice, cone pedicles, 13,435 \u00b1 1961; horizontal cells, 1120 \u00b1 133; OFF cholinergic amacrine cells, 1259 \u00b1 261; ON cholinergic amacrine cells, 1084 \u00b1 104; C57BL/6NCrl mice, cone pedicles, 12,760 \u00b1 818; horizontal cells, 1128 \u00b1 78; OFF cholinergic amacrine cells, 1220 \u00b1 170; ON cholinergic cells, 1071 \u00b1 110. The densities of the four cell types did not differ significantly between the two substrains and are in agreement with published data of C57BL/6 mice (Jeon et al., 1998; Strettoi and Pignatelli, 2000; Whitney et al., 2008). On this basis, we assume that data gained from either substrain of C57BL/6 mice are interchangeable.In transgenic mice (Gus\u2013GFP), which express GFP under the control of the gustducin promoter (Huang et al., 2003; Lin and Masland, 2005), Type 7 bipolar cells and their axons terminating in sublamina 4 of the IPL are prominently labeled (Fig. 2). Less intense GFP expression is also found in RB cells and their axon terminals in sublamina 5, close to the ganglion cell layer. Across the retinal surface of Gus\u2013GFP mice, staining of Type 7 bipolar cells is patchy; in some areas, all cells express GFP, whereas in other areas only individual cells are labeled. Figure 2 shows a well isolated Type 7 cell in a horizontal view with the focus on the dendrites. The dendrites branch into many small terminals, which are the sites of contact with cone pedicles. With the plane of focus in sublamina 4, the axon terminal of this cell becomes apparent (Fig. 2), and, in sublamina 5, RB axon terminals are found (Fig. 2). Focusing through a retinal whole mount thus reveals the whole Type 7 cell, dendrites, cell body, and axon terminal. The cone pedicles were labeled in the same whole mounts with antibodies against glypho, alternatively for PNA, or by the staining of GluR5 in bipolar cell dendritic tips (Haverkamp et al., 2005).Bipolar cells of the Gus\u2013GFP transgenic mouse line. , Vertical section through a Gus\u2013GFP mouse retina immunostained for GFP (green) and calretinin (red).

The cell in Figure 3 (same cell as in Fig. 2,C) was in contact with seven cone pedicles, and that in Figure 3 contacted nine cones. The histogram in Figure 3 shows, measured for a sample of 94 cells, the frequency of cone contacts, which ranged from 5 to 12 with a mean \u00b1 SD of 8.4 \u00b1 1.4 ( = 94).Cone contacts of Type 7 bipolar cells. , , Dendritic trees of two Type 7 bipolar cells. , , Their cone contacts (red label, GluR5 marking cone pedicles). , Frequency histogram of the number of cone contacts of individual Type 7 cells. , Group of neighboring Type 7 cells. , Same field as in  (red label, glypho-stained cone pedicles). , Blue circles mark cones contacted by two bipolar cells, and white circles mark cones contacted by one bipolar cell. , Dendritic fields of Type 7 bipolar cells outlined by white lines. , Axon terminals of the bipolar cells in , outlined by the white lines. Scale bar: , 12.5 \u03bcm; , 15 \u03bcm; , , 20 \u03bcm.Cone pedicles close to the center of a bipolar cell dendritic field receive more dendritic terminals, and cone pedicles innervated by distal dendrites receive fewer contacts (Fig. 3,) (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). This was quantified by measuring the area of contact between dendritic terminals and cone pedicles in relation to distance from the center (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). The sizes of the contacts decreased for distal dendrites and dropped to 50% at \u223c12.5 \u03bcm eccentricity (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Comparable results have been found by P. W. Keeley and B. E. Reese (personal communication). They counted the number of dendritic terminals per pedicle and found six in the center, which dropped to 3 at 12.5 \u03bcm eccentricity. Cone pedicles in the center of the bipolar cell dendritic field provide, therefore, a stronger input than peripheral ones, and the sensitivity profile of a bipolar cell will be bell shaped (Dacey et al., 2000). However, it has to be emphasized that the feedback from horizontal cells and the electrical coupling of neighboring cones both will also have major influences on the overall shape of the sensitivity profile (Hornstein et al., 2004).The divergence of the cone signal, that is the number of Type 7 bipolar cells to which a given cone is connected, was studied in well stained patches, in which all Type 7 cells were labeled (Fig. 3). The dendritic trees of the cells were more or less isolated (Fig. 3), but, in some instances, peripheral dendrites of neighboring cells terminated at the same cone pedicle (Fig. 3, arrows). As mentioned above, peripheral dendrites provide smaller contacts with cone pedicles, which might be compensated by such double innervation. Figure 3 shows the cone pedicle in addition to the bipolar cells, and Figure 3 presents an analysis of the cone contacts. White circles show cone pedicles contacted by dendrites of only one bipolar cell, and blue circles indicate pedicles that innervate two bipolar cells. The mean number of Type 7 bipolar cells a given cone connects, the divergence of the cone signal, is between 1 and 2. There is not much redundancy in this connectivity pattern; it just ensures that each and all cone pedicles in Figure 3 are contacted by at least one Type 7 bipolar cell without any \u201cblind spots.\u201d Figure 3 shows the cell bodies and dendritic territories of Type 7 cells in a larger area (which includes the cells analyzed in Fig. 3). The dendritic fields (white outlines) do not show much overlap.The same holds true for the axon terminals (Fig. 3). By following the descending axons through the stack of optical sections, it was possible to delineate the individual axon terminals (Fig. 3, white outlines). Neighboring axons do not overlap; they are strictly territorial.We analyzed the density of Type 7 bipolar cells together with the cone density in nine fields (141 \u00d7 106 \u03bcm wide) and found, as shown in Table 1, a mean \u00b1 SD bipolar cell density of 2256 \u00b1 221/mm2 ( = 9) and a mean \u00b1 SD cone density of 14,833 \u00b1 2602/mm2 ( = 9). There were 6.6 \u00b1 1.2 times (mean \u00b1 SD;  = 9) more cones than Type 7 bipolar cells, which means that Type 7 bipolar cells have to contact at least 6.6 cones to provide a coverage of 1. As shown in Figure 3, Type 7 bipolar cells contact a mean of 8.4 cones, and, therefore, the coverage is 8.4/6.6 = 1.3.In conclusion, dendritic trees and axon terminals of Type 7 cells tile the retina without much overlap; they are territorial. Type 7 bipolar cells contact on average 8.4 cones. All cones (leaving aside blue cones) are contacted by at least one Type 7 cell (coverage of 1.3). In the ventral retina of the mouse, most cones express both M- and S-opsin (Sz\u00e9l et al., 1992). When we mention \u201cblue cones,\u201d we refer to the genuine blue cones that express only S-opsin and comprise <5% of mouse cones (Haverkamp et al., 2005). We did not specifically label blue cone pedicles in the present study and did not address the question as to whether certain bipolar cell types contact or avoid blue cone pedicles.By the application of two immunocytochemical markers, antibodies against HCN4 channels and antibodies against PKARII\u03b2, Mataruga et al. (2007) could show that Type 3 bipolar cells can be subdivided in Type 3a and Type 3b. Type 3a and 3b cells were originally considered to represent one morphological type because their axons terminate in a narrow stratum in sublamina 2 of the IPL (Fig. 1). Differences in their dendritic morphology and their axon terminals did not show up in the vertical view of Lucifer-yellow-injected cells on which the classification of Ghosh et al. (2004) was based.We applied in the present study antibodies against HCN4 and PKARII\u03b2 to retinal whole mounts and analyzed the cone contacts and retinal distributions of Type 3a and Type 3b bipolar cells (Fig. 4). Type 3a cells have curly dendrites (Fig. 4), and the dendritic terminals surround the cone pedicles like nests. Type 3b cells have more crescent-shaped dendrites that approach the cone pedicles more directly (Fig. 4). Close inspection of Figure 4,  and , shows that all cone pedicles are in contact with bipolar cell dendritic terminals. However, both Type 3a and 3b cells have dendritic terminals that are not associated with cone pedicles (Fig. 4,, arrows), and we interpret such terminals as contacts with rod spherules (Mataruga et al., 2007). We also measured the number of cones contacted by individual Type 3a (Fig. 4) and Type 3b cells (Fig. 4), the convergence of the cone signal. It was found that Type 3a cells contacted a mean \u00b1 SD of 7.6 \u00b1 2.2 ( = 89) cones, whereas Type 3b contacted a mean \u00b1 SD of 6.2 \u00b1 2 ( = 62) cones only. This is compensated by the higher density of Type 3b cells. The density of Type 3a cells (Table 1) was 1866 \u00b1 605/mm2 (mean \u00b1 SD;  = 16), and that of Type 3b cells was 3254 \u00b1 536 ( = 11). There were 6.1 \u00b1 0.9 times (mean \u00b1 SD;  = 16) more cones than Type 3a bipolar cells and 4.0 \u00b1 0.4 times (mean \u00b1 SD;  = 11) more cones than Type 3b cells. The resulting coverage of Type 3b cells was 7.6/6.1 = 1.25, and that of Type 3b cells was 6.2/4.0 = 1.55. This shows that each and all cones (leaving aside blue cones) are contacted by at least one Type 3a and one Type 3b cell.Retinal distribution and cone contacts of Type 3a and Type 3b bipolar cells. , Dendritic trees of Type 3a bipolar cells immunostained for HCN4 (green), cone pedicles are marked by GluR5 (red). , Axon terminals of the Type 3a bipolar cells in . , Frequency histogram of the number of cone contacts of Type 3a cells. , Dendritic trees of Type 3b bipolar cells immunostained for PKARII\u03b2 (green), cone pedicles are marked by GluR5 (red). , Axon terminals of the Type 3b bipolar cells in . , Frequency histogram of the number of cone contacts of Type 3a and Type 3b cells. Scale bar, 25 \u03bcm.The axon terminals of Type 3a cells (Fig. 4) are thicker and more varicose than those of Type 3b cells (Fig. 4). The white outlines show the axonal territories. The axon terminals of Type 3a cells do not overlap their next neighbors (Fig. 4), and the same holds true for the axon terminals of Type 3b cells (Fig. 4). However, it has to be emphasized that they both costratify in sublamina 2, and, therefore, axon terminals of Type 3a and 3b cells must intermingle. This predicts that the territorial behavior of axon terminal has to be regulated by highly type-specific interactions and signals.A retinal whole mount that was triple immunostained for GluR5, calsenilin, and NK3R is shown in Figure 5,  and . GluR5 marks the cone pedicles, and calsenilin reveals the dendritic network of Type 4 bipolar cells (Fig. 5) (Haverkamp et al., 2008). Type 4 bipolar cells have more diffuse axon terminals within sublamina 1 and 2 of the IPL (Fig. 1). Unfortunately, in the whole mount, we were not able to separate the axon terminals because calsenilin-labeled additional cells in the ganglion cell layer and their dendrites overlapped with the Type 4 axon terminals. However, we could count the number of cones contacted by individual Type 4 cells and found a mean \u00b1 SD convergence of 7.4 \u00b1 1.1 ( = 31). The mean \u00b1 SD density of Type 4 cells was 3005 \u00b1 573/mm2 ( = 12), and the mean \u00b1 SD cone density was 13,836 \u00b1 1530/mm2 ( = 12) (Table 1). There were 4.6 \u00b1 0.7 times (mean \u00b1 SD;  = 12) more cones than Type 4 cells, and the resulting coverage of Type 4 cells was 7.4/4.6 = 1.6. This shows that each and all cones (leaving aside blue cones) are contacted by at least one Type 4 bipolar cell.Dendritic trees of bipolar cells in a retinal whole mount that was triple labeled for calsenilin (Csen), NK3R, and GluR5. , Dendritic trees of Type 4 bipolar cells immunolabeled for calsenilin (green), cone pedicles are marked by GluR5 (red). , Dendritic trees of Type 1 and Type 2 bipolar cells immunolabeled for NK3R (green), cone pedicles are marked by GluR5 (red). Scale bar, 25 \u03bcm.NK3R immunoreactivity in Figure 5 is found in thick processes, and they also contact every cone pedicle. However, as has been described previously, two bipolar cell types, Type 1 and Type 2, are immunoreactive for NK3R (Haverkamp et al., 2003; Ghosh et al., 2004; Pignatelli and Strettoi, 2004). The axons of Type 1 and Type 2 cells terminate in sublaminas 1 and 2, and they form a dense plexus in NK3R-labeled retinal sections and cannot be separated. Apparently, the same holds true for the dendrites, and, consequently, the thick processes in Figure 5 may not represent individual dendrites but several dendrites fused into a single bundle. The mean \u00b1 SD density of NK3R-immunoreactive bipolar cell bodies was 4556 \u00b1 1491/mm2 ( = 11), and the mean \u00b1 SD cone density was 11,185 \u00b1 3186/mm2 ( = 11) (Table 1). This is nearly twice the bipolar cell density encountered so far, and the high density supports the conclusion that NK3R immunoreactivity is found in two bipolar cell types. In the following, selective markers will be presented that separate these two bipolar cell types.Fox and Sanes (2007) have shown that the synaptic vesicle-associated protein synaptotagmin 2 (Syt2) is expressed in bipolar cells with axon terminals in sublamina 1/2 of the IPL. They demonstrated that these bipolar cells are also recoverin positive, which is unique for Type 2 cells (Haverkamp et al., 2003). Figure 6 shows a vertical section of a mouse retina double labeled for Syt2 and calretinin. Syt2 immunoreactivity was present in rod spherules of the OPL, in bipolar cell bodies in the INL, and in two distinct groups of bipolar cell axon terminals in the IPL. The outer stratifying, brightly labeled axon terminals in sublamina 1/2 are those of Type 2 bipolar cells as described by Fox and Sanes (2007). The inner, less intensely stained terminals in sublamina 3/4/5 we classify as the axon terminals of Type 6 bipolar cells. When compared with the schematic drawing of the Type 6 cell in Figure 1, the Syt2-labeled axon terminals follow the general description of Type 6, but they are more varicose and most of their branches are found in sublamina 4/5. Type 7 bipolar cells and rod bipolar cell axons (Figs. 1, 2) terminate also in sublamina 4/5 of the IPL, and, therefore, one has to exclude that Syt2 is expressed in these cells. We double labeled a section of the retina of the Gus\u2013GFP mouse for GFP (Fig. 7) and Syt2 (Fig. 7). Syt2-labeled axon terminals in sublamina 4/5 intermingle with GFP-labeled Type 7 and RB axon terminals (Fig. 7), but they are not double labeled. A confusion of Syt2-labeled axon terminals with Type 8 or Type 9 cell axons is not possible, because Type 8 cells have much wider axon terminals and Type 9 cells are much more sparsely distributed.Syt2 immunostaining of Type 2 and Type 6 bipolar cells. , Vertical section, double labeled for Syt2 (green) and calretinin (red).

Scale bar, 25 \u03bcm.It was also possible to study Syt2-immunostained Type 2 and Type 6 axon terminals in retinal whole mounts. With the focus plane in sublamina 1/2, the axon terminals of Type 2 (Fig. 6) and in sublamina 4/5 the axon terminals of Type 6 (Fig. 6) became apparent. The white outlines define the area occupied by individual axon terminals, and, as described above for other types of bipolar cells, they are territorial and do not overlap with neighboring axon terminals. From the density of their axon terminals, we could estimate the mean \u00b1 SD density of Type 6 bipolar cells (Table 1) as 3379 \u00b1 372/mm2 ( = 8) at a mean \u00b1 SD cone density of 12,916 \u00b1 1006/mm2 ( = 8). The resulting cone to bipolar cell ratio of 3.9 \u00b1 0.5 (mean \u00b1 SD;  = 9) predicts that Type 6 bipolar cells have to contact at least four cones (convergence) to provide a coverage of 1. Unfortunately, only the axon terminals of Type 6 cells expressed Syt2; the dendrites were not labeled and their cone contacts could not be studied.The Clm12 mouse is one of the transgenic mouse lines that express Clomeleon under the control of the  promoter. Because of the known variegation of this promoter, different retinal neurons express Clomeleon in the different mouse lines (Berglund et al., 2006). A retinal section of the Clm12 mouse line, immunostained for GFP, is shown in Figure 7. Many ganglion and amacrine cells, as well as a sparse population of bipolar cells, are labeled. The section was also immunostained for Syt2 (Fig. 7), which labels Type 2 cells. Type 6 axon terminals are not visible in Figure 7; they are too faintly stained. The superposition of the two figures in Figure 7 shows that all GFP-immunoreactive bipolar cells also express Syt2 and are, therefore, Type 2 cells. However, the dendrites of the GFP-labeled cells (Fig. 7) are not obscured by rod spherules, and, therefore, the dendritic branching pattern of Type 2 cells could be studied in Clm12 mice.Figure 8 shows the dendritic network of Type 2 cells labeled for GFP in a whole mount of the Clm12 mouse retina. The cone pedicles were stained for PNA. Every single cone pedicle is in contact with a dendrite of a Type 2 cell. Some of the cells were well isolated and the convergence could be studied (Fig. 8). Type 2 cells (Fig. 8) contacted between three and eight cones (mean \u00b1 SD, 5.6 \u00b1 1.2;  = 66). The outlines of the dendritic fields in Figure 8,  and , show that there is not much overlap between dendritic fields of neighboring Type 2 cells. This is also supported by the density measurements (Table 1). The mean \u00b1 SD density of Type 2 cells was 3212 \u00b1 543/mm2 ( = 11), and the mean \u00b1 SD density of cones sampled from the same retinal positions was 11,806 \u00b1 1371/mm2 ( = 11). The cone to bipolar ratio was 3.8 \u00b1 0.7 (mean \u00b1 SD;  = 11), and the coverage was 5.6/3.8 = 1.5. Comparable with the other bipolar cells analyzed above, each and all cones (leaving aside blue cones) are contacted by one or two Type 2 bipolar cells.Dendritic network and cone contacts of Type 2 bipolar cells. , Dendritic network of Type 2 bipolar cells in the Clm12 mouse (green) and cone pedicles (PNA labeled, red). , Frequency histogram of the number of cone contacts of Type 2 bipolar cells. , Dendritic trees of the Type 2 bipolar cells in . , Overlap of the dendritic trees in . Scale bar: , 25 \u03bcm; , , 22 \u03bcm.In the retina of Clm1 transgenic mice, the blue cone bipolar cells (Type 9) were prominently labeled, and their selective contacts with blue cones and retinal distribution could be studied (Haverkamp et al., 2005). In addition to blue cone bipolar cells, additional bipolar cells were more weakly labeled, their labeling was patchy across the retina, and they comprised several morphological types (Duebel et al., 2006). Figure 9 shows a retinal whole mount of a Clm1 transgenic mouse that was triple labeled for Clm, NK3R, and Syt2. Type 1 and Type 2 bipolar cells together are immunoreactive for NK3R (Fig. 9), whereas only Type 2 cells are immunolabeled for Syt2 (Fig. 9). The superposition of NK3R and Syt2 labeling (Fig. 9), therefore, shows Type 2 cells double labeled and Type 1 cells single labeled for NK3R. Figure 9 shows the NK3R labeling and the bipolar cells expressing Clm. Most Clm-labeled bipolar cells within that field are also immunoreactive for NK3R; hence, they are either Type 1 or Type 2 cells. Figure 9 shows for the same field Clm expression and Syt2 labeling, and none of the Clm-labeled cell bodies express Syt2, which shows that they must represent Type 1 cells. Figure 9 finally is a collapsed stack of the Clm-labeled bipolar cells, and the dendritic fields of two Type 1 cells are delineated by the white outline.Whole mount of a Clm1 mouse retina, triple labeled for NK3R, Syt2, and GFP. , NK3R-labeled bipolar cell perikarya (red). , Same field as in ; Syt2 labeling of Type 2 cell bodies (green). , Superposition of  and  shows that Type 2 cells are double labeled for NK3R and Syt2.

The two bipolar cells marked by the arrows are not immunoreactive for Syt2 in  and  but are immunoreactive for NK3R in  and  and thus represent Type 1 bipolar cells. Their dendritic fields are outlined. Scale bar, 25 \u03bcm.To estimate the density of Type 1 cells, whole mounts were triple labeled for glypho, which labels cones, for NK3R that labels Type 1 and Type 2 cells, and for Syt2 that labels only Type 2 cells (data not shown). By subtracting the density of Syt2-labeled cells from the density of NK3R-labeled cells the density of Type 1 cells was calculated. Alternatively, the bipolar cells were counted that expressed only NK3R but not Syt2. From these counts, a mean \u00b1 SD density of Type 1 cells of 2233 \u00b1 399/mm2 ( = 10) and a mean \u00b1 SD density of cones of 11,840 \u00b1 1315/mm2 ( = 10) were found (Table 1). There were 5.4 \u00b1 0.9 times (mean \u00b1 SD;  = 10) more cones than Type 1 bipolar cells. Clm1-labeled Type 1 bipolar cells contacted a mean \u00b1 SD number of 8 \u00b1 1 cones ( = 15), and, therefore, the coverage is 8/5.4 = 1.48. All cones (leaving aside blue cones) are contacted by one or two Type 1 bipolar cells.In vertical sections through the retina of transgenic mice that express EGFP under the control of the 5-HT3R promoter, exclusively bipolar cells were labeled (Fig. 10). Double labeling the retina for calretinin and GFP (Fig. 10) shows that the axons of GFP-labeled bipolar cells terminate in a narrow stratum representing sublamina 3 of the IPL, which corresponds to Type 5 bipolar cells (Fig. 1) (Ghosh et al., 2004). We studied the EGFP-expressing Type 5 cells and the cones also in retinal whole mounts (Fig. 10,). We had no difficulties in measuring the densities of Type 5 bipolar cells together with the cone densities. We could follow the axons descending into the IPL, but the axon terminals formed such a dense, overlapping meshwork that we failed to delineate individual axon terminals. The same was true for the dendritic trees. They contacted usually more than five cone pedicles, but we could not reliably define individual dendritic trees because of the strong overlap of dendrites. The mean \u00b1 SD density of Type 5 bipolar cells was 5001 \u00b1 631/mm2 ( = 10) at a mean \u00b1 SD cone density of 12,687 \u00b1 1755/mm2 ( = 10).Type 5 bipolar cells are labeled in the 5-HT3R\u2013EGFP mouse retina. , Vertical section through the retina of the 5-HT3R\u2013EGFP mouse. , Vertical section double labeled for GFP (green) and calretinin (red). , , Same field of a whole mount of a 5-HT3R\u2013EGFP retina. , Focus on the cell bodies of GFP-labeled bipolar cells. , Focus on the cone pedicles marked by GluR5 immunostaining (red). Scale bar: , , 25 \u03bcm; , , 32 \u03bcm.As can be seen in Table 1, the density of Type 5 bipolar cells is approximately twice that of other bipolar cells. We also listed at the bottom of Table 1 NK3R-immunostained cells and Type 3 cells, which both comprise two types, for comparison with the Type 5 cells. Their densities and cone to bipolar cell ratios are closely similar, and the numbers predict that 5-HT3R\u2013EGFP (Type 5) cells actually are two types, Type 5a and Type 5b. This is supported by the dense network of their dendrites and axon terminals, which is probably the result of the superposition of two independent dendritic and axonal territories. In the rat retina, a subdivision of rat Type 5 bipolar cells by the application of antibodies against the different HCN channels HCN1, HCN2, and HCN4 has been described previously (Fyk-Kolodziej and Pourcho, 2007). However, application of the same antibodies to the mouse retina did not distinguish the Type 5a and 5b cells postulated here (F. M\u00fcller, unpublished observations). Other markers that separate mouse Type 5a and 5b cells will hopefully be found in the future.Five putative OFF cone bipolar cells were analyzed in the present study by selective markers (Fig. 11). Type 1 bipolar cells were found to be immunoreactive for NK3R, and they could also be identified in Clm1 transgenic mice. Type 2 bipolar cells expressed NK3R and Syt2 immunoreactivity (Fox and Sanes, 2007). Type 3a and Type 3b cells were immunostained for HCN4 and PKARII\u03b2, respectively (Mataruga et al., 2007), and Type 4 cells expressed calsenilin (Haverkamp et al., 2008). In the case of ON cone bipolar cells, markers for four types were described. Type 5 bipolar cells were labeled in the 5-HT3R\u2013EGFP mouse, but they represent two types (Fig. 11, named 5a and 5b). Type 6 bipolar cells were partially identified because their axons stratifying in sublamina 4/5 express Syt2. Type 7 bipolar cells were labeled in the Gus\u2013GFP mouse (Huang et al., 2003). Type 9, the blue cone bipolar cell, has been identified in Clm1 mice (Haverkamp et al., 2005). Rod bipolar cells have been immunostained for PKC\u03b1 (Negishi et al., 1988; Greferath et al., 1990). This list suggests that, with the exception of Type 8 bipolar cells, selective markers, which stain the whole population, are available for all bipolar cell types of the mouse retina. We would argue that this catalog of 11 cone bipolar and one rod bipolar types is complete for the following reason. The sum of the bipolar cell densities listed in Table 1 is 39,975/mm2, and the average \u00b1 SD cone density is 12,867 \u00b1 1142 ( = 10). Jeon et al. (1998) have performed a quantitative study of the major cell populations of the C57BL/6NCrl mouse retina and described an average cone density of 12,400/mm2 and an average bipolar cell density of 41,221/mm2. The difference between the bipolar cell densities of the present study and that of Jeon et al. (1998) is 1246/mm2 at a cone density of 12,400/mm2. This allows, postulating a coverage of 1, the presence of an additional bipolar cell type that contacts a minimum of 10 cones. Type 8 bipolar cells have a wide dendritic field and a wide axon terminal (Ghosh et al., 2004) and thus may represent this type. This analysis suggests that the catalog of 11 cone bipolar cells and one rod bipolar cell is complete, and all major bipolar cell types of the mouse retina appear to have been discovered.Summary diagram of the bipolar cell types as defined in the present study. A total of 11 cone bipolar cells and one rod bipolar cell could be distinguished by immunocytochemical staining (outlines) or by GFP/Clomeleon expression in transgenic mouse lines (green cells).The number of cone pedicles contacted by individual bipolar cells varied from an average of 5.6 for Type 2 cells to an average of 8.4 for Type 7 cells. Midget bipolar cells, which contact a single cone in the primate retina (Polyak, 1941), have not been observed in the mouse retina. The divergence of the cone signal (coverage) varied between 1 and 2 and did not differ significantly between the bipolar cell types. However, the quantitative analysis of the present study has shown that each and all cones are connected to at least one member of any given type of bipolar cell (leaving aside the blue cone pathway) (Haverkamp et al., 2005). Consequently, each cone pedicle is connected to a minimum of 10 different bipolar cells. They represent 10 separate channels that transfer the light signal into the IPL. Parallel processing, therefore, starts at the first synapse of the retina, the cone pedicle (Boycott and W\u00e4ssle, 1999; Roska and Werblin, 2001).All cones within the dendritic tree of a given bipolar cell are contacted by this cell. Cone pedicles in the center of the dendritic field receive more dendritic terminals; cone pedicles innervated by distal dendrites receive fewer contacts (Fig. 3,) (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). It is, therefore, to be expected that cones in the center contribute more weight to the light response than peripheral cones, and the sensitivity profile of bipolar cells is bell shaped (Dacey et al., 2000). Distal dendrites of two neighboring bipolar cells often contact the same cone pedicle (Fig. 3), which could compensate for the lower input weight to either bipolar cell. The summed sensitivity could thus be smooth giving every individual cone the same weight in the bipolar cell network (Borghuis et al., 2008).The axon terminals of the different bipolar cell types showed a territorial behavior, and neighboring axon terminals of the same type did not overlap but filled the available space evenly with their varicosities. A comparable tiling has been described for rod bipolar axon terminals in the rabbit (Young and Vaney, 1991), for OFF midget bipolar cells in the primate (Milam et al., 1993; W\u00e4ssle et al., 1994), and for calbindin-immunostained bipolar cells of the rabbit (Massey and Mills, 1996).Such even distribution of axon terminals may also have the consequence that the output synapses of these bipolar cells are evenly distributed within their specific sublamina. An interesting question is how the precisely layered and territorial arrangement of axon terminals is formed during retinal development. Type-specific interactions have to be postulated because, as shown for the Type 3a and 3b bipolar cell axon terminals (Fig. 4,), terminals of different types can overlap within the same sublamina. Yamagata and Sanes (2008) have presented evidence that, during embryonic development, proteins such as Dscam and Sidekick are involved in lamina-specific segregations of neuronal processes within the IPL.Axon terminals of neurons that project from the lamina to the medulla in  show a type-specific segregation into different layers and a territorial columnar organization, which is comparable with the bipolar cell axons of the mouse retina (Millard et al., 2007). It has been shown by Millard et al. (2007) that elimination of Dscam2 abolishes the territorial behavior of L1 axons. They proposed homophilic Dscam2 interactions between neighboring axons followed by contact-dependent repulsion as the mechanism to make axon terminals territorial. Such contact dependent repulsion of axons has also been described recently for the axons of R8 photoreceptors in  (Tomasi et al., 2008). It is an attractive idea to postulate comparable mechanisms for the development of bipolar cell axon terminals in the mouse retina.It has been shown that expression of specific genes is required for cone bipolar cell development. , a member of the  homeobox gene family, is expressed in developing bipolar cells and is localized to a specific subset of cone bipolar cells in the mature mouse retina (Cheng et al., 2005). In -deficient mice, defects were observed in Type 2 and Type 3 cone bipolar cells. The differentiation of these two bipolar cell types has been shown previously to require the homeodomain\u2013CVC transcription factor  (visual system homeobox 1) (Chow et al., 2004). More recently, novel genetic markers of murine bipolar cells have been found (Kim et al., 2008a,b). They have been attributed to ON cone, OFF cone, and rod bipolar cells by RNA  hybridization analysis. However, an attribution to specific types has not yet been possible. Badea and Nathans (2004) were able to identify different bipolar cell types of the mouse retina by a genetically directed alkaline phosphatase reporter. They performed a cluster analysis of the labeled cells, which accounted for parameters such as stratification and diameter of axon terminals. A total of eight clusters of bipolar cells was identified, and some of the clusters showed close correspondence to the classification applied in the present study. Cluster 4 appears to represent blue cone bipolar cells (Type 9), and cluster 8 is similar to Type 8 cells.There are at least nine morphological types of cone bipolar cells in the mammalian retina, which have been classified according to their branching pattern, the number of cones contacted, and the shape and stratification of their axons in the IPL (cat: Famiglietti, 1981; Kolb et al., 1981; McGuire et al., 1984; Pourcho and Goebel, 1987; Cohen and Sterling, 1990a,b; rabbit: Famiglietti, 1981; Mills and Massey, 1992; Jeon and Masland, 1995; McGillem and Dacheux, 2001; monkey: Boycott and W\u00e4ssle, 1991; rat: Euler and W\u00e4ssle, 1995; Euler et al., 1996; mouse: Ghosh et al., 2004; Pignatelli and Strettoi, 2004). During recent years, several immunocytochemical markers of cone bipolar cells have been identified. Unfortunately, some of these markers are expressed in different bipolar cell types among different species. Recoverin immunolabeling, for instance, is expressed in OFF midget bipolar cells of the macaque monkey retina (Milam et al., 1993; W\u00e4ssle et al., 1994), in OFF and ON bipolar cells of the rat retina (Euler and W\u00e4ssle, 1995), and in OFF bipolar cells of the mouse retina (Haverkamp et al., 2003). In the marmoset monkey, CD15 is expressed in OFF midget and DB6 ON cone bipolar cells (Chan et al., 2001), in the rabbit, CD15 labels an ON cone bipolar cell (Brown and Masland, 1999), whereas in the mouse, CD15 is expressed in OFF cone bipolar cells (Jakobs et al., 2003; Ivanova et al., 2006). These examples show that a comparison of bipolar cell types between different species has to rely on multiple features, such as the expression of glutamate receptors (kainate or AMPA) (DeVries, 2000), the axonal stratification, and the cone convergence (midget or diffuse), and at present, a unifying classification scheme of mammalian bipolar cells is not yet possible.This work was supported by a grant from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (FOR 701, PE 38/16-1).

The neural mechanism by which this mPFC\u2013lPFC interaction occurs remains unknown. We hypothesized that transient synchronous oscillations in the theta range reflect a mechanism by which these structures interact. To test this hypothesis, we extracted oscillatory phase and power from current\u2013source\u2013density-transformed electroencephalographic data recorded during a Flanker task. Theta power in the mPFC was diminished on the trial preceding an error and increased immediately after an error, consistent with predictions of an action-monitoring system. These power dynamics appeared to take place over a response-related background of oscillatory theta phase coherence. Theta phase synchronization between FCz (mPFC) and F5/6 (lPFC) sites was robustly increased during error trials. The degree of mPFC\u2013lPFC oscillatory synchronization predicted the degree of mPFC power on error trials, and both of these dynamics predicted the degree of posterror reaction time slowing. Oscillatory dynamics in the theta band may in part underlie a mechanism of communication between networks involved in action monitoring and cognitive control.Recent theories of prefrontal cortex functioning postulate that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) interacts with lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) in a dynamic loop during goal-directed performance (Botvinick et al., 2001; Ridderinkhof et al., 2004b). This theoretical network uses a monitoring system [putatively mPFC, particularly anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)] to signal the need for enhanced cognitive control (putatively lPFC) during conditions of conflict or after an error. The exact nature of this network remain unexplained, and resolution of this issue has been hindered by the lack of a proposed mechanism for this interaction (Kerns et al., 2004; Ridderinkhof et al., 2004a,b). In this report, evidence is presented that neural oscillatory mechanisms might underlie functional communication between action-monitoring and cognitive control networks across mPFC and lPFC regions.The integrity of the action-monitoring system appears to decline on trials preceding response errors. Error-preceding trials are characterized by progressively faster reaction times (Gehring and Fencsik, 2001), decreases in PFC activity, and an increase in default-mode activation (Weissman et al., 2006; Eichele et al., 2008), and alteration of the event-related potential (Ridderinkhof et al., 2003) that may be reflective of a smaller response-locked neuroelectric signature (Allain et al., 2004). Convergent evidence suggests that a transition from a goal-directed state to an inattentive state may hinder performance by contributing to a failure to attend to incoming stimulus-response mappings. After an error, the action-monitoring system (mPFC) is proposed to function as an alarm, recruiting the control network (lPFC) to reallocate attention or increase the motor threshold (Botvinick et al., 2001; Eichele et al., 2008). Posterror reaction time slowing is commonly used as a measurement of instantiated cognitive control, because error-following trials are characterized by a deliberate alteration of the speed/accuracy trade-off. Posterror slowing has been predicted by ACC and lPFC activity after errors (Garavan et al., 2002; Kerns et al., 2004; Kerns, 2006; Hester et al., 2007), but these studies have not revealed how the proposed monitoring and control systems interact.Synchronized neural oscillations may be one mechanism by which different regions within a network (e.g., mPFC and lPFC) can interact (Engel and Singer, 2001; Fries, 2005). A growing body of work is focusing on the oscillatory characteristics of frontal midline theta (4\u20138 Hz) in the generation of the EEG signature of errors, the error-related negativity (ERN) (Luu et al., 2004; Trujillo and Allen, 2007). The ERN may provide a sensitive index of both decreases (Allain et al., 2004) and error-related increases (Yeung et al., 2004a) of the action-monitoring system. Additionally, the ERN has been shown to correlate with both error-related ACC activation and posterror reaction time slowing (Debener et al. 2005), possibly providing an index of cognitive control. Given the theta oscillatory dynamics of the ERN, oscillatory phase synchrony between mPFC and lPFC in the theta band is a plausible and untested mechanism for the collaborative functioning of action-monitoring and cognitive control networks.Fourteen introductory psychology students (six female; mean age, 18.86; \u00b1SD, 0.95) served as participants to partially fulfill a research experience requirement for their class. All participants were free from past neurological trauma, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and were free from current psychoactive medication use. The data from these 14 participants were taken from another study (T. O. C. Gr\u00fcndler, J. F. Cavanagh, C. M. Figueroa, M. J. Frank, and J. J. B. Allen, unpublished data) investigating obsessive-compulsive symptomatology. Note that the 14 participants used for the present study had normative levels of obsessive-compulsive symptomatology (obsessive-compulsive inventory-revised scores: mean, 8.6; SD, 6.8; range, 0\u201317). All participants gave informed consent before participating.Participants completed a modified Eriksen Flankers task (Eriksen and Eriksen, 1974; Eriksen and Schultz, 1979) which has been described in detail in previous reports (Cavanagh and Allen, 2008; Gr\u00fcndler, Cavanagh, Figueroa, Frank, and Allen, unpublished data). On each of the 400 trials in this speeded response task, participants were required to press one of two hand-held response buttons with their thumbs to identify the center letter in a string that is either congruent (i.e., MMMMM or NNNNN; 200 trials total) or incongruent (i.e., NNMNN or MMNMM; 200 trials total) from the flankers. The target\u2013hand mappings were reversed between consecutive blocks to increase response conflict. Errors were likely to occur on incongruent trials, attributable to increased response competition, or after target\u2013hand switches. EEG was recorded from 62 channels on the scalp using a stretch-lycra Ag-AgCl electrode cap. Mastoid sites, vertical and horizontal ocular sites (vertical electro-oculogram and horizontal electro-oculogram) were recorded with drop electrodes. All sites were grounded anterior to Fz and referenced online posterior to Cz. Data were sampled at 500 Hz, amplified 500\u00d7, with a bandpass of 0.05\u2013100 Hz, and impedances were <10 K\u03a9.A matching algorithm was used to match trials for reaction time (RT), selecting the correct trial with RT closest to each erroneous response. Response-locked epochs were obtained for these trials (N), as well as the two trials preceding (N-2 and N-1) and after (N+1 and N+2) each error and matched correct trial. All EEG data were visually inspected for artifacts, and epoched from \u22121000 to +2000 ms peri-response, with large windows to accommodate edge artifacts induced by wavelet convolution. Eye blinks were corrected using a regression algorithm. All participants had EEG data for at least 29 erroneous responses and at least 20 epochs for single-trial analyses. All EEG epochs were then converted to current source density (CSD) using the methods of Kayser and Tenke (2006). CSD computes the second spatial derivative of voltage between nearby electrode sites, acting as a reference-free spatially enhanced signal representation. The CSD transformation highlights local electrical activities at the expense of diminishing the representation of distal activities (volume conduction). The diminishment of volume conduction effects by CSD transformation may reveal subtle local dynamics and also lead to more accurate characterization of local activities during the calculation of long-distance coherence. All CSD-event-related potentials (ERPs) were created at the FCz electrode by filtering (1\u201315 Hz), baseline correcting (\u2212100 to 0 ms), and cutting the length (\u2212300 to +500 ms) of each raw CSD epoch before averaging. CSD\u2013ERPs were measured as the size of the difference between the largest trough (between 0 and 120 ms) and the preceding peak, with a larger CSD\u2013ERP component (i.e., a more negative ERN) quantified as a larger positive value.Time\u2013frequency calculations were computed using custom-written Matlab (The MathWorks) routines (Cohen et al., 2008). Power and intertrial phase coherence (ITPC) were calculated for the raw CSD\u2013EEG epochs at electrode FCz. The CSD\u2013EEG time series in each epoch was convolved with a set of complex Morlet wavelets, defined as a Gaussian-windowed complex sine wave: \u22122\u03c0 \u22122/(2*\u03c32), where  is time,  is frequency (which increased from 2.5 to 50 Hz in 30 logarithmically spaced steps), and \u03c3 defines the width (or \u201ccycles\u201d) of each frequency band, set according to 4.5/(2\u03c0). A width of 4.5 provides an adequate trade-off between temporal and frequency resolution (Trujillo and Allen, 2007). We also reran the analyses using three cycles (greater temporal resolution at the expense of frequency resolution) (supplemental Fig. S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). From the resulting analytic signal, we obtained the following: (1) estimates of instantaneous power (the magnitude of the analytic signal), defined as () (power time series: () = real[()]2 + imag[()]2); and, (2) phase (the phase angle) defined as \u03c6t = arctan(imag[()]/real[()]). Each epoch was then cut in length (\u2212300 to +500 ms peri-response) and baseline corrected to the average frequency power from \u2212300 to \u2212100 ms before the onset of the cue (Cohen et al., 2008). Power was normalized by conversion to a decibel (dB) scale (10*log10[power()/power(baseline)]), allowing a direct comparison of effects across frequency bands.Two different types of oscillation phase coherence were examined: intertrial phase coherence and interchannel phase synchrony (ICPS). ITPC measures the consistency of phase values for a given frequency band at each point in time over trials, in one particular electrode. Phase coherence values vary from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates random phases at that time\u2013frequency point across trials, and 1 indicates identical phase values at that time\u2013frequency point across trials. The phase coherence value is defined as follows:\n\n where  is the number of trials for each time and each frequency band. ITPC thus reflects the extent to which oscillation phase values are consistent over trials at that point in time\u2013frequency space (power, in contrast, represents the intensity of that signal). Note that this measure of phase coherence does not differentiate between possible biophysical mechanisms underlying phase consistency, such as phase reset or phase \u201csmearing.\u201d Rather, this measure simply indicates the statistical probability of increased phase consistency between trial and baseline epochs. The hypotheses for the current investigation require comparing these measures of phase consistency across conditions, not comparing the difference in underlying biophysical mechanisms, per se.ICPS measures the extent to which oscillation phases are similar across different electrodes over time\u2013frequency. ICPS is calculated in a similar manner as intertrial phase coherence as follows:\n\n where  is the number of trials, \u03c6 and \u03c6 are the phase angles of electrode  and . Thus, phase angles are extracted from two electrodes and then subtracted: if the phase angles from the two electrodes fluctuate in synchrony over a period of time, their difference will be constant (i.e., nonuniformly distributed), leading to ICPS values close to 1. All ICPS values were computed as the percentage change from the precue baseline. For convenience, we use the term \u201ccoherence\u201d when describing the consistency of phase angles over trials within a single electrode (ITPC), and the term \u201csynchrony\u201d when describing the consistency of phase angles between two channels (ICPS).For this investigation, F5\u2013FCz and F6\u2013FCz sites were used to measure phase synchrony between mPFC and lPFC. To rule out an alternative explanation of volume conduction effects, ICPS was also calculated between CP3\u2013FCz and CP4\u2013FCz: these pairs are of similar spatial difference between F5/6 and FCz in the posterior direction (closest Euclidean distance), but no theories postulate a role for these posterior areas in the type of cognitive control under investigation here. We selected both F5 and F6 phase synchrony because the literature does not provide a clear indication about whether PFC-based cognitive control is lateralized (Garavan et al., 2002; Kerns et al., 2004; Kerns, 2006; Hester et al., 2007). For the trial-averaged analyses, ICPS was calculated for each time point over trials, using the equation above. For the single-trial analyses, ICPS was calculated at each trial over time points. Here, the equation was the same, but  now refers to the number of time points instead of number of trials. Based on the time\u2013frequency analyses shown in Figures 2 and 3 and supplemental Figure S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material, two analytic windows around the response were chosen for quantification of theta-band activities (4\u20138 Hz): (\u2212100 to 300 ms) and (0 to 200 ms).All power, ITPC, and ICPS measures were quantified as the average value and time of peak. For clarity and simplicity, only the error/correct trials (N) and immediately surrounding trials (N-1 and N+1) in the wide (\u2212100 to 300 ms) window were entered into statistical analyses of averaged values. Separate 2 (accuracy: error, correct) * 3 (trial: N-1, N, N+1) ANOVAs were run for each measure, with an expected accuracy by trial quadratic interaction. For ICPS measures, additional tests were conducted to examine laterality by mirroring the 2*3 ANOVA, but with an additional (hemisphere: right F6, left F5) dimension, with an expected accuracy by trial interaction in the absence of a lateralized effect. The spatial specificity of the ICPS on trial N was tested with a 2 (accuracy: error, correct) * 2 (hemisphere: right, left) * 2 (caudality: anterior F5/6, posterior CP3/4) ANOVA, with an expected accuracy by caudality interaction. Where appropriate, follow-up paired-samples  tests (error vs correct) were conducted to test specific a priori hypotheses. Single-trial analyses were performed on error and error-following trials. Individual standardized \u03b2 weights were taken from bivariate regressions between a priori determined measures of conflict-control activities (ICPS and FCz power) and posterror reaction time (from posterror trials which were answered correctly), within two different analytic windows: (\u2212100 to 300 ms) and (0 to 200 ms).Participants made an average of 60.1 (\u00b1SD, 52.2) errors on the task, with errors on incongruent trials consisting of 70% of total errors. EEG data were available for an average of 52.2 (\u00b1SD, 20.1) errors, and all subsequent behavioral analyses were performed on these errors (and RT-matched correct trials). Participants self-corrected on an average of 53% (\u00b1SD, 29%) of these error trials, although this proportion varied widely across participants. There were similar RTs for error (mean, 427.0; \u00b1SD, 71.0) and reaction time matched correct trials (mean, 438.7; \u00b1SD, 63.1). Participants displayed reliable posterror reaction time slowing (mean, 79.4; \u00b1SD, 22.9; one-sample  test: (13) = 12.47;  < 0.001; , 3.46), shown in Figure 1 .Time courses of CSD activities (mean \u00b1 SE). , CSD\u2013ERPs show decreased activity preceding an error and increased activity immediately after an error. The reaction time plot shows posterror slowing. , Averaged FCz (mPFC) power demonstrates similar dynamics as the CSD\u2013ERP, but F5 and F6 (lPFC) sites show no accuracy difference. , Averaged FCz intertrial phase coherence increases after errors, but F5 and F6 sites show no difference. Note that ordinate scaling on FCz plots in  and  are 200% of the F5 and F6 ordinate. , Differences in peak latency for power and phase coherence at the FCz site. This accuracy-related difference shows that phase coherence latency is constant, but peak power occurs much later after an error.The CSD\u2013ERP 2*3 ANOVA revealed a significant accuracy by trial interaction ((1,13) = 17.8;  < 0.001; partial \u03b72 = 0.58), and follow-up  tests indicated that the CSD\u2013ERP was larger on error trials ((13) = 3.4;  < 0.01;  = 0.90) and smaller on error-preceding trials ((13) = \u22122.8;  < 0.01;  = 0.75) compared with each corresponding correct trial. These data replicate previous investigations of a diminished response-locked voltage negativity immediately preceding errors (Allain et al., 2004), and a large response-locked voltage negativity (ERN) directly after error commission (Figs. 1, 2).Response locked CSD grand averages for N-1 (left), N (center), and N+1 (right) trials. , CSD\u2013ERPs and topographic maps. Topographic maps reflect the average from 50 to 90 ms after the response. , Power in dB. Note the latency of error trial power compared with all other power plots. The error\u2013correct contrast reveals a large burst of power in the theta and low alpha range after an error. , Intertrial phase coherence (R). Note the increase of phase coherence after an error, especially \u223c4 Hz.The CSD\u2013ERN from the ERP analysis significantly correlated with theta power ((14) = 0.57;  < 0.05, 2 = 0.32) and ITPC values ((14) = 0.64;  < 0.01; 2 = 0.45), indicating a large degree of shared variance between ERP, power, and phase coherence measures immediately after an error. Figure 2 shows complementary perspectives of ERP, power, and phase coherence measures for error and peri-error trials. Similar to the CSD\u2013ERN findings, the theta power value 2*3 ANOVA revealed a significant accuracy by trial interaction ((1,13) = 22.6;  < 0.001; partial \u03b72 = 0.64), and follow-up  tests indicated that power was larger on error trials ((13) = 4.8;  < 0.001;  = 1.28) and smaller on error-preceding trials ((13) = \u22122.4;  < 0.05;  = 0.65) compared with each corresponding correct trial (Fig. 1). The ITPC value 2*3 ANOVA also revealed a significant accuracy by trial interaction ((1,13) = 5.0;  < 0.05; partial \u03b72 = 0.28), where ITPC was greater on error trials ((13) = 2.6;  < 0.05;  = 0.68), but there was no effect for error-preceding trials compared with the corresponding correct trial (Fig. 1). Similar statistical tests were run for each lPFC site (F5 and F6) separately. There were no significant 2*3 ANOVA interactions or single-trial  tests for F5 or F6 power value or ITPC value (Fig. 1,).The peak power latency 2*3 ANOVA revealed a significant accuracy by trial interaction ((1,13) = 10.3;  < 0.01; partial \u03b72 = 0.44), whereby peak power latency was longer after errors compared with the corresponding correct trial ((13) = 3.2;  < 0.05;  = 0.86). Peak ITPC latency did not differ between error and correct trials. Complementary statistical tests were run for each lPFC site (F5 and F6) separately. There were no significant 2*3 ANOVA interactions or single-trial  tests for F5 or F6 peak power latency or peak ITPC latency. An additional ANOVA was used to investigate the difference between the longer mPFC peak power latency and constant mPFC peak ITPC latency on error trials. A 2 (accuracy: error, correct) * 2 (measure: peak power time, peak ITPC time) ANOVA revealed a significant interaction ((1,13) = 6.1;  < 0.05; partial \u03b72 = 0.32), where ITPC remained temporally constant yet power increased \u223c100 ms later after errors compared with the corresponding correct trial measures (Fig. 1).Error trials may be predicted by a decline in response-related mPFC power on the preceding trial. Error-related mPFC activities consist of an increase in both ITPC and power values. Although ITPC occurs at the same time on error and correct trials, a prolonged peak latency of the power burst appears to be specific to error trials. There were no significant 2*3 ANOVA interactions or single-trial  tests for F5 or F6 power value, peak power time, ITPC value, or peak ITPC time, indicating that these power and ITPC effects are specific to the mPFC and are not seen in lPFC sites.The ICPS between mPFC and lPFC was robustly increased on error trials, as demonstrated by the significant accuracy by trial interaction ((1,13) = 15.4;  < 0.01; partial \u03b72 = 0.54), with no main or interaction effects for hemisphere. Follow-up  tests indicate that both F5\u2013FCz ((13) = 2.6;  < 0.05;  = 0.70) and F6\u2013FCz ((13) = 2.8;  < 0.05;  = 0.75) pairs demonstrated significantly greater ICPS on error compared with correct trials. Focusing just on trial N, the increased ICPS with mPFC was specific to these lPFC sites (not CP3/4 sites), as demonstrated by a significant accuracy*caudality interaction ((1,13) = 5.9;  < 0.05; partial \u03b72 = 0.31) with no main or interaction effects for hemisphere. These findings indicate that error trials alone are characterized by increased mPFC\u2013lPFC connectivity as measured by ICPS in the theta band, as shown in Figure 3.Grand-averaged interchannel phase synchrony calculated as a percentage change from baseline. ICPS is increased after errors, with robust increases in the theta band at frontal sites.Figure 4 displays the results of the single-trial analyses. One sample  tests of the individual standardized \u03b2 weights revealed that ICPS predicted FCz theta power during errors between both F5\u2013FCz (\u2212100 to 300 ms: (13) = 6.71,  < 0.001,  = 1.79; 0 to 200 ms: (13) = 7.01,  < 0.001,  = 1.87) and F6\u2013FCz sites (\u2212100 to 300 ms: (13) = 2.42,  < 0.05,  = 0.64; 0 to 200 ms: (13) = 2.48,  < 0.05,  = 0.66). Both peak theta power at FCz (\u2212100 to 300 ms: (13) = 2.54,  < 0.05,  = 0.68; 0 to 200 ms: (13) = 2.04,  = 0.06,  = 0.54) and the latency of peak FCz theta power (\u2212100 to 300 ms: (13) = \u22123.43,  < 0.01,  = 0.92; 0 to 200 ms: (13) = \u22125.25,  < 0.01,  = 1.4) on the error trial predicted posterror slowing, with greater peak power and faster peak latencies predicting more reaction time slowing on the following trial. F5\u2013FCz ICPS did not significantly predict posterror slowing (\u2212100 to 300 ms: (13) = 0.82,  > 0.10,  = 0.22; 0 to 200 ms: (13) = 1.13,  > 0.10,  = 0.30), but F6\u2013FCz ICPS did predict posterror slowing in the narrow time window (\u2212100 to 300 ms: (13) = 1.62,  > 0.10,  = 0.43; 0 to 200 ms: (13) = 2.86,  < 0.01,  = 0.77). Additionally, we calculated congruency effects on single-trial analyses (supplemental Fig. S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Overall, in all analyses shown in Figure 4 and supplemental Figure S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material, the relationship between ICPS and FCz power is strong and distinct, whereas ICPS and FCz power metrics each moderately predicted posterror slowing.Single-trial analyses of the proposed cognitive control and action-monitoring network. Data from two different analytic windows are included: (\u2212100 to 300 ms) and (0 to 200 ms). The degree of theta-band synchrony between lPFC and mPFC sites (ICPS) predicts the amount of FCz theta power increase. The degree of posterror slowing is predicted by both FCz theta power dynamics and theta ICPS.This investigation revealed that oscillatory synchrony in the theta band between mid-frontal and lateral frontal sites is increased immediately after response errors of commission. The degree of this oscillatory synchrony correlated with mid-frontal theta power increases, and both of these measures predicted the degree of posterror behavioral adjustment. The waning and waxing of mid-frontal activity during the prelude to and resolution of an error suggests that theta-band phase coherence and power dynamics reflect variability in the integrity of the action-monitoring system. Theta-band oscillatory synchrony between mPFC and lPFC may reflect a mechanism of communication between action-monitoring and cognitive control networks (Botvinick et al., 2001; Ridderinkhof et al., 2004a,b; Yeung et al., 2004a).The conflict-control model of Botvinick et al. (2001) postulates that separate conflict-monitoring and cognitive control systems interact to optimize performance. When a large degree of response conflict is encountered (such as during response errors), an alerting system in the ACC signals the need for enhanced cognitive control. This signal is transferred to lPFC among other regions, where it is used to adjust control over cognitive, motor, or emotion systems to optimize goal-directed performance (Kerns et al., 2004; Ridderinkhof et al., 2004b; Procyk et al., 2007). Other theories suggest that the ACC both detects conflict and acts to switch behavior (Rushworth et al., 2004, 2007; Kennerley et al., 2006). Behavioral adaption may be informed by lPFC areas sensitive to task set and goal-oriented performance (Miller, 2000). Behavioral adaption may be facilitated by altered mPFC activity, which could reallocate attention or increase the motor threshold to avoid further errors (Botvinick et al., 2001; Ullsperger and von Cramon, 2006; Eichele et al., 2008).Multiple accounts of the action-monitoring system predict that the prelude to an error occurs when the integrity of the action-monitoring system diminishes over time, leading to high-conflict situations or errors (Botvinick et al., 2001; Allain et al., 2004; Weissman et al., 2006; Eichele et al., 2008). The resolution of an error may occur when the lPFC and mPFC systems interact to strategically adjust behavior, as shown by previous ERN and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) findings of increased ACC activity preceding larger posterror reaction time adjustments (Garavan et al., 2002; Kerns et al., 2004; Debener et al., 2005; Kerns, 2006; Hester et al., 2007). As noted above and described in previous studies, the ACC does not act alone: it works in concert with other cortical (lPFC) and subcortical structures to act during conflict or error signals to alter behavior. However, the mechanism of communication between these regions had not been specified in previous studies. As discussed below, this investigation has provided novel evidence that oscillatory phase synchrony between medial and lateral PFC reflects a mechanism by which these critical cortical nodes in the action-monitoring and cognitive control networks may operate.The ACC has been shown to generate neural oscillations in the theta band (Wang et al., 2005; Tsujimoto et al., 2006), and these oscillations have been linked to several processes including memory, attention, feedback processing, and response errors (Onton et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2005; Cohen et al., 2007). Our findings add to a growing literature that suggests that neural oscillations in the theta range underlie conflict/error detection processes (Luu and Tucker, 2001; Luu et al., 2003, 2004; Trujillo and Allen, 2007; Cohen et al., 2008). The data from this investigation support the idea that response errors are accompanied by enhanced medial frontal theta, and also suggests that the interaction between action-monitoring and cognitive control systems capitalize on these ongoing oscillatory theta dynamics.The pattern of error-preceding and error-following mPFC oscillatory dynamics in this investigation suggests that demanding motor responses might always be characterized by phasic mid-frontal power and phase coherence increases, and that errors represent a special case of altered oscillatory dynamics. An ongoing background of oscillatory perturbation would fit with neurological models of the ERN, which have characterized the oscillatory perturbation and power increase specific to error trials (Luu et al., 2004; Trujillo and Allen, 2007). The proposal that errors capitalize on ongoing response-related oscillatory dynamics does not conflict with the major computational models of the ERN such as Hopfield energy (Yeung et al., 2004a) or temporal difference error (Holroyd and Coles, 2002). Rather, it suggests that either of these formulae (or any other yet-to-be-specified algorithm) could account for error-driven alteration of power values over an inherent response-related background of oscillatory perturbation. Indeed, theta oscillatory reorganization and power enhancement may be the neurobiological means by which these computations are performed.The dissociation between power and phase coherence peak times suggests that phase coherence is a temporally constant response-related phenomenon, and that inherent increases in power and phase coherence are enhanced after errors. We were able to reveal this dissociation by using precue (instead of preresponse) baselines, because previous work has shown that oscillatory processes related to conflict monitoring may arise preresponse (Cohen et al., 2008). This dissociation also argues against an alternative view that theta oscillatory dynamics arise as a methodological consequence of filtering a nonoscillatory \u201cburst\u201d (Yeung et al., 2004b, 2007), because this view would predict that the time course of phase coherence and power would be the same. A temporally extended, frequency band-specific response supports the oscillatory hypothesis, because if the theta effect were a filter artifact, it would not last much longer than the window of the ERN [see also Trujillo and Allen (2007) for further arguments supporting the oscillatory hypothesis]. Although the ERN normally peaks at \u223c80 ms, the temporal dynamics of error-related activity occur across a wide window of time. Future EEG and fMRI investigations may endeavor to parse the temporal and spatial specificity of mPFC activity: both ERN and error positivity effects have been implicated in dorsal and rostral ACC within 300 ms of an error (Van Veen and Carter, 2002; Luu et al., 2003). It is unknown, however, if there are hemodynamic consequences of phase synchrony, because phase synchrony may occur in absence of overall changes in power. Thus, the executive network implicated by coherent oscillations between mPFC and lPFC regions may be uniquely assessed by EEG.Synchronous oscillations are thought to reflect a mechanism for entrained interregional activity. Rhythmic excitability may allow temporal windows of coordinated spike timing across spatially separate neural networks (Fries, 2005). Synchronous oscillations have been observed across multiple and disparate sites in the brain (K\u00f6nig et al., 1995; Chawla et al., 2001; Nikouline et al., 2001; Freeman and Rogers, 2002), suggesting that information is transferred via wave packets (Rubino et al., 2006; Benucci et al., 2007). After an error, mPFC and lPFC sites showed synchronous phase relations, suggesting that they had become transiently functionally linked. The lack of similar functional connectivity with posterior sites at a comparable distance from the mPFC site bolsters this argument of specific functional linking between mPFC and lPFC and not mere volume conduction of activity. In contrast to the interchannel phase synchrony, error-related power and phase coherence increases were demonstrated only in the mPFC (not lPFC). This dissociation between local error-related mPFC and lPFC activities suggests that the concurrent timing of oscillatory dynamics, and not power or response-locked phase coherence alone, underlies communication between these regions.Given that mPFC\u2013lPFC oscillatory coherence correlated with the degree of mPFC power increase, and both of these predicted the degree of posterror slowing, it is highly likely that these EEG dynamics reflect interrelated processes relevant to the detection and correction of errors. These effects were also larger on posterror trials that were incongruent (supplemental Fig. S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), similar to a recent study which revealed ACC\u2013lPFC coupling in the theta band after incongruent trials in a Stroop task (Hanslmayr et al., 2008). Both the peak mPFC power and the latency of the peak predicted the degree of posterror slowing, suggesting that both the speed and magnitude of the error signal in the mPFC indicate the degree of conflict and need for subsequent behavioral adaptation. Future research may aim to parse the temporal and intensity dynamics of this error-related oscillatory readjustment (even occurring preresponse) as determinants of the severity of an error and latency of corrective adjustment.We propose that inter-region oscillatory synchrony in the theta band may be one mechanism by which action-monitoring and cognitive control networks interact in the prefrontal cortex. This long-range oscillatory synchrony may capitalize on an inherent background of medial frontal theta-band oscillatory perturbation and power increase during manual responses. Errors may induce altered oscillatory and power dynamics in this system, which in turn support enhanced computation and interregional communication. The findings of this investigation suggest that the dynamic oscillatory interplay between medial and lateral frontal regions underlies our ability to detect errors and adjust behavior accordingly.This work was supported by infrastructure provided by National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Grant R01-MH066902.

In the present study, we characterized sources of local input to nine distinct types of layer 2/3 inhibitory neurons in living slices of mouse somatosensory cortex. Whole-cell recordings from identified cell types, facilitated by use of transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein in limited inhibitory neuron populations, were combined with laser scanning photostimulation. We found that each inhibitory cell type received distinct excitatory and inhibitory laminar input patterns. Excitatory inputs could be grouped into three categories. All inhibitory cell types received strong excitation from layer 2/3, and for calretinin (CR)-positive Martinotti cells and burst-spiking interneurons, this was their dominant source of excitatory input. Three other cell types, including fast-spiking basket cells, CR-negative Martinotti cells, and bipolar interneurons, also received strong excitatory input from layer 4. The remaining four inhibitory cell types, including chandelier cells, neurogliaform cells, irregular spiking basket cells, and regular spiking presumptive basket cells, received strong excitatory input from layer 5A and not layer 4. Laminar sources of inhibitory input varied between cell types and could not be predicted from the sources of excitatory input. Thus, there are cell-type specific differences in laminar sources of both excitation and inhibition, and complementary input patterns from layer 4 versus layer 5A suggest cell type differences in their relationships to lemniscal versus paralemniscal pathways.Cerebral cortex contains many distinct types of inhibitory neurons, and understanding their connectivity within the cortex is essential for understanding cortical information processing. Although previous research has revealed much about characteristics of individual types of inhibitory neurons (Kawaguchi, 1995; Somogyi et al., 1998; Markram et al., 2004), knowledge about their functional connections (particularly laminar and columnar organization), both with excitatory cells and other inhibitory cells, is relatively limited (Dantzker and Callaway, 2000; Yoshimura and Callaway, 2005; Kapfer et al., 2007; Silberberg and Markram, 2007). This knowledge is, however, critical because a neuron's function is strongly influenced by its synaptic inputs.Functional connections to interneurons have been investigated in depth with paired or multiple intracellular recordings, but laser scanning photostimulation combined with whole-cell patch clamping has its unique advantage in extensively mapping local inputs to a single recorded neuron. By using this technique, studies of local connections to layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in rat and mouse barrel cortex and rat visual cortex reveal that they have similar input patterns; as predicted from anatomical observations, they receive strong feedforward input from layer 4 and recurrent connections from within layer 2/3, as well as weaker input from layers 5a and 5b (Dantzker and Callaway, 2000; Shepherd and Svoboda, 2005; Shepherd et al., 2005; Bureau et al., 2006). In contrast, limited studies of functional connections to layer 2/3 inhibitory neurons in rat visual cortex indicate that their connectivity cannot be predicted from light level anatomical observations (Dantzker and Callaway, 2000). Despite the fact that only two different classes of inhibitory neurons were distinguished [fast-spiking (FS) basket cells and non-FS interneurons], different cell types were shown to receive excitatory input from different sources. In the previous study, comprehensive analyses of functional input to the numerous other inhibitory cell types were hindered by technical difficulties. Specifically, the use of differential interference contrast (DIC) optics to visualize neurons in live slices allowed recordings to be biased toward inhibitory neurons, but it was difficult to target particular types of inhibitory neurons, particularly those that are rare.In the present study, we were able to carefully study many types of inhibitory neurons, as their recordings were facilitated by visualization of green fluorescent proteins (GFPs) in limited subsets of inhibitory neurons in transgenic mice expressing GFP under the control of the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) promoter. To correlate sources of input with other features unique to each cell type, we identified morphological, electrophysiological, and neurochemical features of nine inhibitory cell types, and characterized their laminar sources of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input within local cortical circuits by combining whole-cell patch-clamp recordings with laser scanning photostimulation in living brain slices. Our data indicate that different types of inhibitory neurons in mouse S1 layer 2/3 exhibit distinct laminar patterns of both excitatory and inhibitory input, indicating that their differential input sources, together with their different intrinsic properties, contribute to their different functions within intact cortical circuits.All animals were handled and experiments were conducted in accordance with procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at The Salk Institute for Biological Studies. The G42 transgenic mice were generated in the laboratory of Josh Huang at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (Chattopadhyaya et al., 2004). We obtained the \u201cGIN\u201d (GFP-expressing inhibitory neurons) transgenic mice (Oliva et al., 2000) from The Jackson Laboratory. The G30 transgenic mice were originally generated in the laboratory of G\u00e1bor Szab\u00f3 at the Department of Functional Neuroanatomy at the Institute of Experimental Medicine in Budapest, Hungary (L\u00f3pez-Bendito et al., 2004).To prepare living brain slices, animals (postnatal day 17\u201323) were deeply anesthetized with Nembutal (>100 mg/kg, i.p.), rapidly decapitated, and their brains removed. A vibratome was used to cut 400-\u03bcm-thick coronal brain slices from somatosensory cortex of the mice. Slices were cut in ice-cold artificial CSF (ACSF: 124 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.25 mm KH2PO4, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 3.2 mm CaCl2, 26 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm glucose) with a broad-spectrum excitatory amino acid antagonist kynurenic acid (1 mm) and then were stored in an interface holding chamber aerated with 95% O2\u20135% CO2 at 34\u00b0C for at least 30 min before they were transferred to a recording chamber containing recirculating ACSF with no kynurenic acid and with 90 \u03bcm MNI-caged glutamate (4-methoxy-7-nitroindolinyl-caged l-glutamate; Tocris Bioscience) bubbled with 95% O2\u20135% CO2 at room temperature.Coronal slices were used because this cutting plane tends to preserve the complete morphology of the recorded cells and their laminar connections. In addition, this allows us to compare data with previously published studies using similarly cut slices in rat S1 cortex (Schubert et al., 2003; Shepherd et al., 2003; Shepherd and Svoboda, 2005).Whole-cell recordings were made from cells in layer 2/3 of the barrel region of primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of the mouse. Inhibitory cell types were first identified and selected based on visualization of GFP expression under a DIC/fluorescent Olympus microscope; recordings were subsequently performed under visual control aided by infrared DIC video monitoring through the microscope and a video camera (VE 1000; Mti-Dage). Cell bodies of recorded neurons were at least 50 \u03bcm below the slice cutting surface. Glass electrodes (4\u20138 M\u03a9 resistance) were filled with an internal solution consisting of 130 mm K-gluconate, 6 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm Na2ATP, 0.5 mm Na2GTP, 10 mm K-phosphocreatine, and 0.5% biocytin, adjusted with KOH to pH 7.3\u20137.4. For some recordings in which IPSCs were measured, potassium was replaced with cesium.Resting potentials were measured immediately after electrodes broke into the cells after formation of a gigaohm seal. Before collection of photostimulation data, hyperpolarizing and depolarizing current pulses were injected to examine each cell's basic electrophysiological properties. We focused on analyzing interspike intervals, spike frequency adaptation, as well as shapes of single spikes elicited by depolarizing current pulses near threshold strength. Spike frequency adaptation index was calculated as the ratio of the first interspike interval and the last interspike interval of a spike train. Spike shape analysis was conducted similar to Murphy and du Lac (2001). Briefly, action potential height was defined as the difference in membrane potential between threshold and the peak. Action potential width was defined as the time from spike threshold to the threshold crossing during repolarization. Afterhyperpolarization (AHP) amplitude was defined as the difference between action potential threshold and the most negative membrane potential attained during the AHP. The duration of AHP was defined as AHP time, the time from the action potential peak to the trough of the AHP.Once stable whole-cell recordings were achieved with good access resistance (usually <20 M\u03a9), laser scanning photostimulation experiments were conducted. Focal uncaging of caged glutamate was through a 10 ms pulse of UV laser light that was focused on the plane of the brain slice through a 40\u00d7 microscope objective. To map the locations of input to a single cell, 300\u2013800 sites spaced at 50 \u03bcm apart from neighboring sites were stimulated, and stimulation sites were located throughout a rectangular area surrounding the recorded neuron, typically extending 200\u2013300 \u03bcm laterally on either side of the cell and vertically from the white matter to layer 1. The order in which the points were stimulated was patterned to assure that adjacent sites were never stimulated within 8 s. This was done because glutamate receptors desensitize but recover completely within a few seconds. Photostimulation trials were interleaved with control trials (no stimulation) to obtain spontaneous postsynaptic currents. At each site, the control trial was immediately after the stimulation trial. For both photostimulation and control trials, data were acquired for a total duration of 400 ms. However, only the responses within 150 ms after stimulation onset were analyzed (see below). For each cell, high-resolution maps of the locations of neurons providing monosynaptic excitatory and/or inhibitory input were obtained. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings (at \u221265 mV) were made from the recorded postsynaptic neurons, and inward EPSCs were measured for both stimulation trials and no-stimulation control trials. Outward IPSCs were measured by changing the holding potentials of neurons to close to 0 mV.After completion of photostimulation and recordings from a cell, the laser was used to burn alignment sites into the slice so that  photostimulation coordinates could be assigned to their corresponding positions in the tissue. In addition, slice images were taken in the bath chamber to register the positions of the recording electrodes and cortical layers. Lesions were detected with cytochrome oxidase staining of the brain slices (Dantzker and Callaway, 2000), and laminar borders were determined using the combined information from live slice images, 4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride staining and CO staining of slices. Identification of the barrel- or septum-related columns were also confirmed in the CO-stained slices.For excitatory responses, laser-induced photolysis of caged glutamate can induce two major forms of activity: (1) a direct response (inward currents) to activation of the recorded neuron's glutamate receptors; and (2) synaptically mediated responses (EPSCs) resulting from the suprathreshold activation of presynaptic excitatory neurons. Responses within the 10 ms window from laser onset were assigned as direct, as they had a distinct shape (longer rise-time) and occurred immediately after glutamate uncaging (shorter latency) (see supplemental Fig. S3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Synaptic currents with such short latencies are not possible because they occur before the generation of action potentials in photostimulated neurons (Dantzker and Callaway, 2000; Yoshimura et al., 2005). Photostimulation around the recorded cell sometimes induced direct currents that exceeded 200 pA and decayed >100 ms, preventing synaptic input from being separately identified at these locations, and, thus, these sites were excluded from analysis. The average percentages of eliminated sites were calculated for each cell type and considered when comparing input patterns across cell types. There were no systematic differences in these values for most cell types. In addition, at some locations, synaptic responses could be resolved from the relatively small direct responses. In these cases, the synaptic contribution was subtracted from the direct response to isolate the synaptic input used for further analysis (supplemental Fig. S3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).For inhibitory responses, uncaging of caged glutamate can induce three types of activity: (1) a direct inward current response to strong activation of the recorded cell's glutamate receptors; (2) short latency \u201cdirect\u201d outward current presumed to result from direct activation of glutamate receptors on the presynaptic terminals of inhibitory neurons; and (3) synaptically mediated responses (IPSCs) resulting from the suprathreshold somatic activation of presynaptic inhibitory neurons, which can be identified based on their latencies and shapes (e.g., see site 3) (supplemental Fig. S3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). We only include actual presynaptic inhibitory input (resulting from somatic firing of inhibitory neurons at stimulated locations) to construct inhibitory input maps.As virtually all layer 1 neurons are inhibitory cells, and pyramidal neurons with apical dendritic tufts in layer 1 could fire action potentials when their tufts were stimulated in layer 1 (Dantzker and Callaway, 2000), EPSCs detected after photostimulation in layer 1 were not included for analyses. However, because layer 1 neurons can provide inhibition to layer 2/3 neurons, we did analyze IPSCs detected after photostimulation in layer 1.To construct maps of synaptic input, the average current amplitudes (EPSCs or IPSCs) in a response window of the first 150 ms after the laser stimulation were measured for both photostimulation and control trials at each stimulation site using custom programs written in Matlab (Mathworks) software. The control response was subtracted from the stimulation response of the same site. These values are expressed as picoamperes for the specified window of analysis (i.e., the first 150 ms after the laser stimulation). The window was chosen because photostimulated neurons fire most of their action potentials during this time (Dantzker and Callaway, 2000; Yoshimura et al., 2005). EPSC or IPSC measurements for each stimulation site were assigned to their cortical layer, and their amplitudes for all stimulation sites within a layer were summed together to calculate average laminar evoked input (EI). The estimated EI from each layer was calculated by subtracting the mean amplitude for control trials from the mean amplitude for photostimulation trials in that layer. For the purpose of visual display, we created color-coded, linearly interpolated maps to illustrate overall input patterns to selected cells. To quantitatively compare laminar input strength across cell types, we also calculated the relative strength of the excitatory or inhibitory input (percentage-evoked input; %EI) to each cell from each layer by expressing the average value from each layer as a percentage of the summed values from all the layers examined (see Figs. 7, 8). We also calculated statistical significance of measured responses from stimulation sites in each layer by comparing the measured mean current amplitudes at photostimulation trials with those of control trials (background spontaneous activity) (supplemental Table S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). In addition, an unsupervised cluster analysis was performed on the %EI data matrix to distinguish any clusters of laminar input patterns (see the cluster dendrogram in supplemental Fig. S4, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). The cluster analysis was performed using a Euclidian distance calculation of within-cluster distances and Ward's linkage method (using a Matlab program) (Briggs and Callaway, 2005).Statistical comparisons of the cells' input strength (including absolute and relative laminar input values) between two groups were performed with the Mann\u2013Whitney  test, except that paired  tests were used to compare average current amplitudes of control and photostimulation conditions at each layer for the sampled cells as shown in supplemental Table S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material. For comparisons across >2 groups, we used the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test (nonparametric one-way ANOVA) and the Mann\u2013Whitney  test for group comparisons. Alpha levels of  \u2264 0.05 were considered significant. All means are presented with SEs unless specified otherwise.After all physiological assays were completed, brain slices were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, then transferred to 30% sucrose solution in PBS. The slices were frozen over dry ice and thawed once, and then the recorded cells were revealed by staining of biocytin with 1:1000 Cy3-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Cell morphology was examined with confocal microscopy, which also confirmed that each recorded cell was indeed the GFP-expressing interneuron originally targeted. Selected neurons were reconstructed using a computerized Neurolucida reconstruction system to examine confocal projection images.The 400-\u03bcm-thick slices were often resectioned to 80 \u03bcm thickness, and the recorded cells in resectioned slices were further immunostained with selected antibodies such as parvalbumin antibody [Swant; rabbit \u03b1-parvalbumin (PV-28), 1:1000], calretinin (CR) antibody [Swant; rabbit \u03b1-calretinin (796), 1:500], or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) antibody [ImmunoStar; rabbit \u03b1-VIP (20077), 1:1000]. Neurochemical features were assessed from staining with selected antibodies. Finally, analyses of all these features as well as intrinsic electrophysiological characteristics were combined to arrive at the final cell type classification.In this study, we examined excitatory and inhibitory input to nine different inhibitory cell types in layer 2/3 of the barrel region of mouse S1. Before describing investigations of the sources of input to each cell type, we describe results demonstrating the methods used to reliably sample from and characterize each inhibitory cell type. Although the methods that we have used clearly distinguish different cell types, for some of these it is not possible to clearly relate the cell types studied to those identified in previous studies (Kawaguchi, 1995; Markram et al., 2004). These relationships are further considered and relevant publications cited in the context of each of the cell types described below. A recent review of cortical inhibitory neuron classification and nomenclature is also instructive (Ascoli et al., 2008).All of the inhibitory neurons described in this study were sampled from three transgenic mouse lines in which enhanced GFP was expressed in limited subsets of inhibitory neurons (Table 1). Thus, our studies are limited to those inhibitory cell types which express GFP in these mouse lines and exclude other inhibitory cell types. For each recorded cell, its type is further determined based on a combination of intrinsic physiological properties, protein expression, and morphology. Careful characterization of GFP-positive cells in each line indicated that expression is reliably limited to only particular neuron types, obviating the need to measure every property in every GFP-positive neuron. Nevertheless, the intrinsic physiology and morphology, as well as the presence of GFP expression, were characterized for every neuron in our sample.GFP+ cell types in the transgenic mouse linesWe recorded from GFP-expressing inhibitory neurons in the S1 region of mouse brain slices, facilitated by using three transgenic mouse lines in which enhanced GFP was expressed in limited subsets of inhibitory neurons. These lines were G42 transgenic mice which express GFP under the control of a murine GAD67 bacterial artificial chromosome clone (Chattopadhyaya et al., 2004), GIN transgenic mice which express GFP under a 2.8 kbp fragment of the murine GAD67 promoter (Oliva et al., 2000), and G30 transgenic mice expressing GFP under a 6.5 kb fragment of the murine GAD65 promoter (L\u00f3pez-Bendito et al., 2004). In these mouse lines, GFP+ cells are bright enough for targeted recordings in living brain slices. Generally GFP+ cells in G30 and GIN mouse sections are brighter than those in G42 mouse sections. GFP+ cells are mostly distributed in upper layers in GIN and G30, whereas G42 GFP+ cells are more concentrated in deeper layers.GFP+ cells in G42 mice have been previously identified as parvalbumin-positive, and those which have been described physiologically are FS basket cells (Chattopadhyaya et al., 2004; Sugino et al., 2006). Layer 2/3 of G42 mouse barrel cortex has a relatively low density of GFP+ cells, compared with deeper layers. We confirmed that a great majority of GFP+ cells in layer 2/3 were FS cells; they were distinguished from other inhibitory cell types by having high firing rates with little or no spike frequency adaptation (supplemental Fig. S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Their spikes had short durations and typically had deep, fast AHPs. Under somatic current injections of moderate strength (\u223c300 pA) in our experimental conditions, their mean spiking adaptation index was 0.87 \u00b1 0.05 (mean \u00b1 SE,  = 9). The mean spike AHP time of FS cells was 1.57 \u00b1 0.15 ms, and their average AHP amplitude was 21.0 \u00b1 1.3 mV. The FS cells were immunopositive for parvalbumin, and they had large somata, long dendrites, and lengthy axons running horizontally or vertically (supplemental Fig. S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Overall, they had the appearance of large basket cells.In addition, we found that a small minority of the recorded GFP+ cells were chandelier cells, as they had the hallmark feature of axons that bring about many candlestick-like axonal terminals (\u201caxon cartridges\u201d) (supplemental Fig. S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). These cells appeared to have weaker GFP expression than FS cells (supplemental Fig. S1,, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). The chandelier cells had dendrites extending upward into layer 1 and had their axonal branches localized in layer 2/3. This morphology is similar to other chandelier cells reported in mouse and rat cortex (Kawaguchi, 1995; Borrell et al., 2005). Under our recording conditions, these chandelier cells were not typical fast spiking, as they exhibited spiking frequency adaptation in response to current injections and their spikes did not have deep and fast AHPs (supplemental Fig. S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Their mean spiking adaptation index was 0.63 \u00b1 0.07 ( = 4). For two of the chandelier cells analyzed for spike shape parameters, their spike AHPs were different from those of FS cells (see above), as their mean AHP time of spikes was 9.0 ms, and their average AHP amplitude was 15.6 mV.Although G42 mice could be used to reliably facilitate recordings from PV-positive fast-spiking and chandelier cells, it is important to note that not all PV-positive cells in this mouse line express GFP. It is therefore likely that the fast-spiking neurons represented in this sample may not include the complete range of PV-expressing fast-spiking cell types that have been observed in the cortex (cf. Markram et al., 2004; Uematsu et al., 2008).GFP expression in GIN mice has been extensively characterized and described in previous publications (Oliva et al., 2000; Halabisky et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2006). Layer 2/3 GFP+ cells in GIN mouse S1 are a subpopulation of somatostatin (SOM) immunopositive interneurons. These cells can be further divided into distinct subtypes based on immunochemical identification of CR [SOM+/CR\u2212 and SOM+/CR+ Martinotti cells (MCs)] (see supplemental Fig. S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) (see also Xu et al., 2006). Both subtypes had the appearance of Martinotti cells, as they had ascending axons to layer 1, where they ramified into a terminal arborization (supplemental Fig. S1,, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). There are, however, noticeable differences between SOM+/CR\u2212 and SOM+/CR+ Martinotti cells, as SOM+/CR+ cells have relatively smaller and round somata, more primary processes from the soma, and more horizontally extended dendritic fields (supplemental Fig. S1,, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) (see also Xu et al., 2006). Both cell types had similar accommodating spike-firing patterns (supplemental Fig. S1,, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Closer examination of their spike parameters indicated that they differed significantly in quantitative aspects of spike shapes, as SOM+/CR\u2212 cells had narrower action potential widths and faster AHP than did SOM+/CR+ cells (for more detailed descriptions of these differences, see Xu et al., 2006).We distinguished five subtypes of inhibitory neurons in G30 mice. All GFP+ cells in G30 transgenic mice were non-fast-spiking cells, and none were SOM-positive Martinotti cells. Thus, there is no overlap between the cell types sampled in G30 versus G42 or GIN mice. Our immunochemical characterization revealed that most GFP+ cells in these mice were VIP/CR-expressing inhibitory neurons, as \u223c40% of GFP cells in layer 2/3 were immunopositive for VIP, and another 20% of these cells were immunopositive for CR (unpublished data). The majority had a multipolar dendritic morphology and tended to be located in upper layer 2/3 (supplemental Fig. S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). (These are distinct from those with a bipolar dendritic morphology, see below.) We divided multipolar cells into three subtypes based on their intrinsic firing patterns. A subset of GFP+ cells in this mouse line have been previously characterized as irregular-spiking cells which are positive for cholecystokinin and express type 1 cannabinoid receptors (Galarreta et al., 2004; Sugino et al., 2006). We also recorded from this subpopulation which fired with an irregular spiking (IS) pattern in response to current injections. For example, IS cells showed considerable variability in interspike intervals both within and between trials (supplemental Fig. S2,, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), even in response to identical current injections (supplemental Fig. S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). At moderate current injection strength (\u223c300 pA), their average interspike interval of single response traces of five or more spikes was 46.0 \u00b1 3.5 ms ( = 13). The average value of their coefficients of variation (defined as the ratio of the SD to the mean) was 0.87 \u00b1 0.07 (see also Galarreta et al., 2004). At high amplitudes of current injections, these cells tended to have initial bursting (supplemental Fig. S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).The other multipolar GFP+ cells include regular spiking (RS) cells and burst-spiking (BS) cells. The multipolar RS cells had regular spiking patterns after depolarizing suprathreshold current injections both from their resting membrane potentials (supplemental Fig. S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) and from hyperpolarized membrane potentials (supplemental Fig. S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). The BS cells had regular spiking patterns from their resting membrane potentials (supplemental Fig. S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) but showed bursting patterns from hyperpolarized membrane potentials (supplemental Fig. S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). The interspike intervals of the bursting spikes of the BS cells were 7.9 \u00b1 0.46 ms ( = 8), which were significantly shorter than the interspike intervals of the first three spikes of the RS cells (28.8 \u00b1 4.0 ms;  = 7) ( < 0.001; Mann\u2013Whitney  test).All three of these types of multipolar, non-FS cells appeared to belong to the larger category of basket cells, as they had putative axonal boutons surrounding the somata of other cells (Galarreta et al., 2004). Multipolar IS and BS cells often had their dendrites and axons extended horizontally in layers 2/3 and 1, whereas multipolar RS cells tended to have a more extensive spread of dendrites and axons in layers 2/3 and 4 (supplemental Fig. S2,,, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Although the IS cells we sampled correspond to the same cell type sampled by Galarreta et al. (2004), the relationships between our RS or BS cells and previously described cell types are not known.In addition, a minority of GFP+ cells in G30 mice were identified as bipolar cells (BCs) or neurogliafrom cells based on their characteristic morphological features and intrinsic physiology. Bipolar cells were small cells with fusiform or ovoid somata, and they had slender and vertical bitufted dendrites with axons that yield a thin plexus of axonal collaterals (supplemental Fig. S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). They showed accommodating spiking patterns in response to current injections (supplemental Fig. S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Neurogliaform cells had a spiderweb-like appearance with a small round soma, short dendrites, and densely arborizing axons. They exhibited characteristics of late spiking as they had slow depolarization ramps before firing spikes in response to threshold current injections (supplemental Fig. S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) (Kawaguchi, 1995; Kawaguchi and Kondo, 2002). They displayed weak or no accommodation when firing multiple spikes (supplemental Fig. S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).Finally, we also recorded pyramidal cells in brain slices from these lines of mice. The pyramidal cells were confirmed by their regular spiking patterns and morphological features such as triangular somata and spiny dendrites. We examined excitatory and inhibitory input to pyramidal cells in layer 2/3 for comparison.In summary, inhibitory cell types studied include the following: two cell types (FS basket cells and chandelier cells) expressing GFP in G42 mice (Chattopadhyaya et al., 2004), two subtypes of MCs which express GFP in GIN mice (Oliva et al., 2000; Xu et al., 2006) and five subtypes of non-fast-spiking cells expressing GFP in G30 mice (L\u00f3pez-Bendito et al., 2004) (multipolar cells with IS, BS, or RS intrinsic physiology, bipolar cells, and neurogliaform cells) (Table 1).We found that, although input patterns were similar for all pyramidal cells, inhibitory cells had diverse input patterns which were conserved for cells of the same type. Although some inhibitory cell types had laminar input patterns similar to those described previously for rat visual cortex (Dantzker and Callaway, 2000; Yoshimura and Callaway, 2005), others had novel input patterns. Below we begin by illustrating examples of the typical laminar patterns of local excitatory and inhibitory input observed for each cell type. Then we compare and summarize excitatory and inhibitory laminar input sources across these cell types.We used laser scanning photostimulation to map local excitatory and inhibitory input sources for all 10 cell types described above. This functional assay allowed high resolution mapping of laminar distributions of presynaptic input sources to single neurons (Dantzker and Callaway, 2000; Yoshimura and Callaway, 2005; Yoshimura et al., 2005). Photostimulation data were collected from 18 FS basket cells, 15 excitatory pyramidal cells, 30 SOM+/CR+ Martinotti cells, 22 SOM+/CR\u2212 Martinotti cells, 15 multipolar IS cells, nine multipolar RS cells, 12 multipolar BS cells, four chandelier cells, five bipolar cells, and four neurogliaform cells, all of which had somata in layer 2/3 of mouse S1 cortex. For most of these cells, both excitatory and inhibitory input maps were sampled. However, for many cells, only one map (excitatory or inhibitory) was sampled. For a complete description of the numbers of cells in each sample, see supplemental Table S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material.We do not separately describe data for cells located above barrels versus septa. First, such differences were not expected; in mouse S1, there are no significant differences in laminar patterns of excitatory input from either layer 4 or from layer 5a to layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons above barrels versus septa (Bureau et al., 2006). Previous studies of S1 cortex have, however, revealed differences between species in the columnar organization of excitatory connections related to the lemniscal versus paralemniscal pathways. For example, in rat S1 cortex, layer 2 pyramidal neurons located above septa receive strong excitatory connections from layer 5a rather than layer 4, whereas neurons above barrels receive strong input from layer 4 (Shepherd and Svoboda, 2005). Furthermore, the great majority of our cells were located above barrels, precluding systematic comparison. Finally, although we have identified systematic differences in excitatory and inhibitory inputs from layer 4 versus layer 5a to different inhibitory cell types (see below), comparisons of cells above barrels to our limited samples above septa revealed no differences in input sources. The descriptions below can therefore be considered as representative of inputs to cells above barrels, but we cannot rule out the possibility that further studies could reveal a different pattern of input to some types of septal cells.We start by describing local input to layer 2/3 pyramidal cells and FS basket cells in mouse S1 cortex, because input patterns of these two cell types have been described unambiguously in a previous study of rat visual cortex (Dantzker and Callaway, 2000), and input to pyramidal cells has been described in rat and mouse barrel cortex (Shepherd and Svoboda, 2005; Shepherd et al., 2005; Bureau et al., 2006). Studies of local synaptic input to pyramidal cells and FS cells of layer 2/3 in previous studies revealed that these two cell types have similar laminar input patterns; both receive strong excitatory input from cortical layers 4, and 2/3 and weaker input from deeper layers, and they receive most of their inhibitory input from layer 2/3. In the present study, we found comparable input patterns for pyramidal cells and FS cells in layer 2/3 of mouse S1 cortex.The pyramidal cells received strong excitatory input from layers 2/3, 4 and 5a, and received much weaker input from layers 5b and 6. Figure 1, , illustrates results from layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. A typical excitatory input map is shown in Figure 1. The cell body is located in layer 2/3, and a reconstruction of major dendrites is shown in black over the color-coded excitatory input map. To map excitatory input in this and other cell types, whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings (at \u221265 mV) were made from the neuron to measure synaptic currents while photostimulating candidate presynaptic neurons with laser scanning uncaging of caged glutamate across hundreds of sites. Examples of inward EPSC responses (sites  and ) of the pyramidal cell are shown in Figure 1. The input map was constructed based on evoked input measured from the recorded pyramidal cell with photostimulation at various locations across cortical layers (for details, see Materials and Methods and supplemental Fig. S3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). In the color-coded excitatory map, the scale codes evoked excitatory input in units of picoamperes, averaged over a response window of 150 ms after photostimulation. The red range indicates strong excitatory input; the blue range indicates no or weak excitatory input. Overall, for the 10 excitatory pyramidal cells, the excitatory EI (measured currents minus spontaneous currents, see Materials and Methods) averaged across stimulation sites in layers 2/3, 4, and 5a were 4.34 \u00b1 0.50 pA (mean \u00b1 SE), 5.48 \u00b1 0.96 pA, and 4.26 \u00b1 0.99 pA, respectively, whereas those of layers 5b and 6 were 1.19 \u00b1 0.48 pA, and 0.60 \u00b1 0.11 pA, respectively (supplemental Table S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material; see also Fig. 7). We also normalized laminar input strength as %EI by expressing the average evoked input from each layer as a percentage of the summed input from all the layers examined. As illustrated in Figure 1, the average excitatory %EIs for layers 2/3, 4, 5a, 5b, and 6 for the pyramidal cells were 30.0 \u00b1 2.9% (mean \u00b1 SE), 34.1 \u00b1 2.4%, 24.4 \u00b1 0.04%, 7.0 \u00b1 2.1%, and 4.5 \u00b1 0.8%, respectively.Laminar patterns of excitatory and inhibitory input to pyramidal cells and fast-spiking cells. , An example map of excitatory input to one pyramidal neuron. A reconstruction of the neuron's cell body and major dendrites is shown in black over the color-coded excitatory input map. The color scale codes evoked input in units of picoamperes, calculated by subtracting the mean spontaneous currents from the mean currents measured after photostimulation for each stimulation site during the 150 ms analysis window (see Materials and Methods). Values for each position are calculated from a linear interpolation of values at discrete stimulation sites.

The cell drawing is shown in white.

The thin white lines delineate laminar boundaries. In both  and , small gray squares indicate stimulation sites omitted from quantitative analysis because of interference of large direct currents during photostimulation (see Materials and Methods and supplemental Fig. S3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).

Scale bars, 100 \u03bcm.Pyramidal cells in layer 2/3 generally received most inhibition from layers 2/3 and 1 (Fig. 1,). To collect inhibitory responses from this and other cell types, whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings (at or close to 0 mV) were made from the recorded cell to map its IPSC responses from stimulated locations (see Materials and Methods and supplemental Fig. S3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material, for construction of an inhibitory input map). Examples of outward IPSC responses (sites iii and iv) of the pyramidal cell are shown to the left of Figure 1. Inhibitory input maps are illustrated with a different color scale, where the yellow/white range indicates strong inhibitory input, and the dark red range indicates no or weak inhibitory input (Fig. 1). The scale represents evoked inhibitory input (measured minus spontaneous) in units of picoamperes, averaged over a response window of 150 ms after photostimulation. The summary data of laminar inhibitory input strength for the pyramidal cells are shown in Figure 1 and supplemental Table S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material. The average inhibitory EIs for the seven pyramidal cells for layers 1 and 2/3 were 3.44 \u00b1 0.65, and 4.20 \u00b1 0.37 pA, respectively, and their average inhibitory %EIs were 36.6 \u00b1 5.8% and 47.0 \u00b1 3.8%, respectively (Fig. 1). For the pyramidal cells, inhibitory inputs from layers 1 and 2/3 were statistically significant compared with nonstimulation control conditions (background spontaneous activity). Other cortical layers (4, 5a, 5b, and 6) did not provide statistically significant inhibitory input above background activity (see supplemental Table S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).FS inhibitory cells received strong excitatory input from layers 2/3, 4, and 5. As shown in Figure 1, the example cell received strong excitatory input from layers 2/3 and 4 and moderate input from layers 5a and 5b. FS cells often had multiple strong EPSCs from stimulated presynaptic locations. Examples of inward EPSC responses (sites v and vi) of the FS cell are shown by Figure 1. The average evoked excitatory inputs for the 12 FS cells for layers 2/3, 4, 5a, and 5b were 5.93 \u00b1 0.43 pA, 7.53 \u00b1 1.08 pA, 2.55 \u00b1 0.37 pA, and 1.93 \u00b1 0.36 pA, respectively. The corresponding values for excitatory %EIs were 34.5 \u00b1 3.0%, 39.9 \u00b1 3.0%, 14.4 \u00b1 2.0%, and 10.3 \u00b1 1.8%, respectively (Fig. 1).FS cells received inhibition predominantly from layers 2/3 and 4 (Fig. 1,). Examples of outward IPSC responses (sites vii and viii) of the example FS cell are shown to the left of Figure 1. Averaged across the 11 FS cells, the inhibitory %EIs for layers 2/3 and 4 were 59.5 \u00b1 9.7% and 28.8 \u00b1 7.2%, respectively (see Fig. 6; supplemental Table S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Layer 6 provided small but significant inhibition to the FS cells, with its inhibitory %EI being 9.8 \u00b1 4.0%. Other cortical layers did not provide significant inhibitory input compared with control conditions.Generally, FS cells and pyramidal cells in mouse barrel cortex received strong excitatory and inhibitory input from cortical layers 4 and 2/3 and weaker input from deeper layers, but the pyramidal cells received a larger proportion of their excitatory input from layer 5a than did the FS cells (excitatory %EI, 24.4 \u00b1 0.04% vs 14.4 \u00b1 2.0%;  < 0.02; Mann\u2013Whitney  test). Although both FS cells and pyramidal cells received their strongest inhibition from layer 2/3, the pyramidal cells examined received significant and strong input from layer 1 (inhibitory %EI, 36.6 \u00b1 5.8%), whereas the FS cells did not receive significant inhibition from layer 1 (inhibitory %EI, 4.5 \u00b1 5.1%), but received relatively strong inhibition from layer 4 (inhibitory %EI, 28.8 \u00b1 7.2%).We previously described two subtypes of MCs expressing GFP in the cortex of GIN mice. Both are immunopositive for SOM, but one subtype is also immunopositive for CR (SOM+/CR+), and the other one is not (SOM+/CR\u2212) (Xu et al., 2006). We mapped excitatory input to 18 SOM+/CR\u2212 MCs and 25 SOM+/CR+ MCs, all of which were expressing GFP in GIN mice and found that these two subtypes received significantly different excitatory input patterns. As illustrated in Figure 2, , , and , SOM+/CR\u2212 MCs received strong excitatory input from both layers 2/3 and 4, whereas SOM+/CR+ MCs received significantly more excitatory input from layer 2/3 and significantly less from layer 4. On average, both types received much weaker input from deeper layers (i.e., layers 5a, 5b, and 6) than superficial layers (Fig. 2; supplemental Table S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). For SOM+/CR\u2212 MCs, their average excitatory %EIs for layers 2/3 and 4 were 48.3 \u00b1 4.2% and 36.6 \u00b1 3.1%, respectively. In comparison, for SOM+/CR+ MCs, their average excitatory %EIs for layers 2/3 and 4 were 73.2 \u00b1 2.8% and 16.8 \u00b1 1.9%, respectively. These two subtypes also differed highly significantly in their prenormalization excitatory input strength (supplemental Table S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material; see Fig. 7) both for input from layer 2/3 and from layer 4 ( < 0.005; Mann\u2013Whitney  test), indicating that the differences between cell types in their %EIs resulted from differences in absolute input strength for both layers 2/3 and 4. SOM+/CR+ MCs had much stronger evoked input from layer 2/3 than from layer 4 (7.07 \u00b1 0.61 pA vs 1.83 \u00b1 0.33 pA;  < 0.001) and SOM+/CR\u2212 MCs had more balanced input from layers 2/3 and 4 (4.86 \u00b1 0.51 pA vs 3.88 \u00b1 0.48 pA,  > 0.1). The ratios of layer 2/3 to layer 4 input for the SOM+/CR+ versus SOM+/CR\u2212 cells were 3.46 \u00b1 0.43 versus 1.56 \u00b1 0.30, respectively ( < 0.001). Thus, the SOM+/CR\u2212 cells received relatively balanced excitation from layers 2/3 and 4, whereas input to SOM+/CR+ cells was dominated by layer 2/3.Laminar patterns of excitatory and inhibitory input to two subtypes of Martinotti cells. , , Example excitatory input maps from a SOM+/CR\u2212 Martinotti cell and a SOM+/CR+ Martinotti cell, respectively (for morphological, immunochemical, and electrophysiological features of the SOM+/CR\u2212 and SOM+/CR+ cells illustrated in  and , see supplemental Fig. S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). , , Example inhibitory input maps from a different SOM+/CR\u2212 Martinotti cell and a different SOM+/CR+ Martinotti cell, respectively. Scales bars: , 100 \u03bcm. , Average laminar strength of excitatory input (%EI) for SOM+/CR\u2212 cells ( = 18; solid red bars) versus SOM+/CR+ cells ( = 25; open bars). These two subtypes differed significantly both in their input strength (% EI) from layer 2/3 and from layer 4 ( < 0.005). (Asterisks denote statistical significance.) , Average laminar strength of inhibitory input (%EI) for SOM+/CR\u2212 cells ( = 6; solid blue bars) versus SOM+/CR+ cells ( = 9; open bars). Generally, the two subtypes have similar inhibitory input patterns. Conventions as in Figure 1.For both subtypes of MCs, we also examined their inhibitory input. As illustrated in Figure 2, , , and , SOM+/CR\u2212 cells and SOM+/CR+ cells both tended to receive extensive inhibition from layers 2/3, 4, and 5. All layers except layer 1 provided statistically significant inhibitory input. The average inhibitory %EIs for layers 2/3, 4, 5a, and 5b for SOM+/CR\u2212 MCs ( = 6) were 29.4 \u00b1 8.1%, 33.3 \u00b1 3.4%, 9.4 \u00b1 15.3%, and 12.8 \u00b1 4.9%, respectively. Similarly, the average inhibitory %EIs for layers 2/3, 4, 5a, and 5b for SOM+/CR+ MCs ( = 9) were 30.0 \u00b1 7.6%, 20.3 \u00b1 5.9%, 12.7 \u00b1 5.3%, and 22.9 \u00b1 6.8%, respectively. Both types of MCs had strong inhibitory input from layers 2/3 and 4, and their inputs from deep layers (i.e., layers 5a and 5b) were also notably large, in contrast with FS cells and pyramidal cells, as well as those layer 2/3 inhibitory cell types previously described in rat visual cortex (Dantzker and Callaway, 2000). Although previous studies have not identified strong inhibitory input from deeper layers, it has been known that layer 5 inhibitory cells send axons to and make synaptic contacts in layer 2/3 (Ma et al., 2006; Silberberg and Markram, 2007). Overall, SOM+/CR\u2212 and SOM+/CR+ MCs had similar inhibitory input strengths across cortical layers with no statistically significant differences (Fig. 2; supplemental Table S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).We mapped and compared local input to multipolar BS, IS, and RS cells that expressed GFP in G30 mice. Similar to SOM+/CR+ MCs, BS cells tended to receive the great majority of their excitatory input from layer 2/3 (Fig. 3,). Their average excitatory %EIs ( = 8) for layers 2/3 and 4 were 74.7 \u00b1 12.2% and 14.2 \u00b1 4.7%, respectively (Fig. 3). Layers 5a, 5b, and 6 provided little or insignificant excitatory input to BS cell (Fig. 3; supplemental Table S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). BS cells also received strong inhibitory input primarily from layer 2/3 (Fig. 3,), similar to the pattern of inhibition onto pyramidal cells and most layer 2/3 inhibitory cell types examined in rat visual cortex (Dantzker and Callaway, 2000). Despite the weak inhibitory input from other layers, it was typically significant above background spontaneous activity. BS cells received statistically significant inhibitory input from layers 2/3, 4, 5b, and 6, and their %EIs ( = 9) were 48.4 \u00b1 4.1%, 6.4 \u00b1 1.8%, 12.7 \u00b1 3.7%, and 8.8 \u00b1 3.4%, respectively (Fig. 3; supplemental Table S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).Laminar patterns of excitatory and inhibitory input to burst-spiking cells. , , Example maps of excitatory and inhibitory input from a BS cell (for morphological and electrophysiological features of BS cells, see supplemental Fig. S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). , , Summary data of laminar input strength (mean \u00b1 SE; %EI), calculated from eight excitatory input maps and nine inhibitory input maps from BS cells. Scale bars, 100 \u03bcm. Conventions are as in previous figures.We found that several cell types received strong excitation from layers 2/3 and 5a but not layer 4. This input pattern has not been observed in previous studies of other cortical areas and/or cell types. As shown in the example input maps and summary histograms in Figure 4, , , , and , IS cells and RS cells received strong excitatory input from layers 2/3 and 5a, but they tended to receive relatively weak or no input from layer 4, leaving a gap between the zones of strong input. This input pattern was observed consistently across the cells of these types and was distinct from input patterns for pyramidal cells, FS cells, Martinotti cells, and BS cells (see below; see Fig. 7).Laminar patterns of excitatory and inhibitory input to multipolar irregular-spiking cells and regular-spiking cells. , , Example maps of excitatory and inhibitory input from an IS cell (for morphological and electrophysiological features of the example IS cell illustrated in  and , see supplemental Fig. S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). , , Summary data of laminar input strength (mean \u00b1 SE; %EI), calculated from 11 excitatory input maps and nine inhibitory input maps from IS cells. , , Example maps of excitatory and inhibitory input from an RS cell (for morphological and electrophysiological features of RS cells, see supplemental Fig. S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). , , Summary data of laminar input strength (mean \u00b1 SE; %EI), calculated from seven excitatory input maps and six inhibitory input maps from RS cells. Conventions are as in previous figures.For IS cells, their average excitatory %EIs ( = 11) for layers 2/3 and 5a were 40.2 \u00b1 3.2% and 35.2 \u00b1 3.8%, respectively, both of which were much stronger than for layer 4 (13.7 \u00b1 3.2%). Compared with pyramidal cells and FS cells, this input pattern can be attributed to a significant decrease in the strength of evoked inputs from layer 4 (1.05 \u00b1 0.33 pA for IS cells, compared with 5.48 \u00b1 0.96 pA and 7.53 \u00b1 1.08 pA for pyramidal cells and FS cells, respectively) (supplemental Table S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). In contrast, absolute amplitudes of input from layers 2/3 and 5a (3.18 \u00b1 0.50 pA and 2.58 \u00b1 0.42 pA, respectively) for IS cells were comparable with pyramidal and FS cells (supplemental Table S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Similarly, for RS cells, their average excitatory %EIs ( = 7) for layers 2/3 and 5a were 36.5 \u00b1 6.5% and 32.1 \u00b1 6.2%, respectively, whereas the %EI for layer 4 was only about half as strong (16.3 \u00b1 2.9%) (supplemental Table S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).The pattern of inhibitory input to IS cells mirrored the pattern of excitatory input. IS cells received strong inhibition from layers 1, 2/3, and 5 and quite weak inhibitory input from layer 4. This input pattern is apparent both in the example map (Fig. 4) and in the average across IS cells (Fig. 4). IS cells received statistically significant inhibitory input from layers 1, 2/3, 5a, and 5b with average inhibitory %EIs ( = 9) of 21.2 \u00b1 5.0%, 38.1 \u00b1 4.0%, 17.0 \u00b1 3.9%, and 16.3 \u00b1 4.5%, respectively (Fig. 4; supplemental Table S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). However, inhibitory input to IS cells from layers 4 and 6 was small and statistically insignificant, with inhibitory %EIs of 2.4 \u00b1 1.9% and 5.0 \u00b1 2.2%, respectively (Fig. 4; supplemental Table S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).Although RS cells had an excitatory input pattern similar to IS cells, they had a different inhibitory input pattern, which is more similar to that of BS cells. As shown in Figure 4,  and , the RS cells received strong inhibition predominantly from layer 2/3; their inhibitory %EI ( = 6) for layer 2/3 was 59.9 \u00b1 13.4%. RS cells also received significant inhibition from layer 4 (inhibitory %EI, 10.3 \u00b1 2.8%). Inhibitory input from layers 1, 5a, and 5b to RS cells was statistically insignificant compared with background spontaneous activity (supplemental Table S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).We also mapped input to a small number of other inhibitory cell types expressing GFP in either G42 or G30 mice, including chandelier cells, neurogliaform cells, and bipolar cells. The chandelier cell illustrated in Figure 5 received extensive excitatory input from layers 2/3, 4, and 5. Averaged across the chandelier cells sampled ( = 3), cells of this type received their strongest excitation from layers 2/3 and 5a (excitatory %EI, 43.8 \u00b1 10.5% and 27.9 \u00b1 4.4%, respectively) and somewhat weaker input from layer 4 (excitatory %EI, 17.9 \u00b1 5.6%) (Fig. 5; supplemental Table S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). These cells received the great majority of their inhibition from layers 1 and 2/3 (inhibitory %EI, 26.5 \u00b1 3.4% and 67.9 \u00b1 11.2%, respectively) (Fig. 5,). They did not receive statistically significant inhibitory input from layer 4 or 5a but received weak significant input from layers 5b and 6 (compared with control trials).Laminar patterns of excitatory and inhibitory input to chandelier cells and neurogliaform cells. , , Excitatory and inhibitory input maps for an example chandelier cell (for morphological and electrophysiological features of the chandelier cell illustrated in  and , see supplemental Fig. S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). , , Summary data of laminar input strength (mean \u00b1 SE; %EI) from three excitatory input maps and four inhibitory input maps from chandelier cells. , , Example maps of excitatory and inhibitory input, respectively, for a neurogliaform cell (for morphological and electrophysiological features of the neurogliaform cell illustrated in  and , see supplemental Fig. S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). , Average laminar strength of excitatory input for four neurogliaform cells, and  shows average inhibitory input strength from these cells. Conventions are as in previous figures.Layer 2/3 neurogliaform cells also received strong excitation from both upper and deep layers (i.e., layers 2/3 and 5) (Fig. 5,). As shown by the example in Figure 5, this cell received strong input from layer 2/3, part of layer 4 and layer 5a. Averaged across all 4 neurogliaform cells sampled, it can be seen that these cells also receive the now familiar pattern of strong excitation from layers 2/3 and 5a with weaker input from the middle of layer 4 (excitatory %EI for layers 2/3, 4, 5a, and 5b: 42.7 \u00b1 3.9%, 19.4 \u00b1 3.9%, 25.4 \u00b1 4.7%, and 11.0 \u00b1 1.4%, respectively) (Fig. 5; supplemental Table S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). This pattern tends to be similar to that observed for IS and RS cells. Inhibitory input to the four neurogliaform cells was primarily from layer 2/3 (inhibitory %EI, 67.8 \u00b1 11.1%).Bipolar cells received excitatory input primarily from layers 2/3 and 4, similar to SOM+/CR\u2212 MCs (compare Figs. 6, 2). Averaged across five bipolar cells, they received significant excitation from layers 2/3, 4, 5a, and 5b (excitatory %EI: 33.8 \u00b1 7.3%, 39.4 \u00b1 6.4%, 14.0 \u00b1 1.6%, and 10.0 \u00b1 2.7%, respectively) (Fig. 6; supplemental Table S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). The five bipolar cells sampled varied in their inhibitory input patterns; three of the five cells received most inhibitory input from layer 2/3, whereas the other two received most inhibition from layers 4 and 5. For the four maps analyzed, their average inhibitory %EIs for layers 2/3, 4, 5a, and 5b were 24.1 \u00b1 10.4%, 21.5 \u00b1 6.4%, 22.1 \u00b1 2.1%, and 20.6 \u00b1 11.2%, respectively (Fig. 6; supplemental Table S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).Laminar patterns of excitatory and inhibitory input to bipolar cells. , Excitatory input map from a bipolar cell, while  shows an inhibitory input map from another bipolar cell (for morphological and electrophysiological features of the bipolar cell illustrated in , see supplemental Fig. S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). , Average laminar strength for excitatory input from the bipolar cells, and  shows their average inhibitory input strength. Conventions are as in previous figures.The excitatory input patterns of all the cell types examined are summarized in Figure 7. A series of cumulative histograms with laminar excitatory %EI are shown in Figure 7 for all 10 cell types: pyramidal cells, FS cells, SOM+/CR\u2212 MCs, SOM+/CR+ MCs, IS cells, RS cells, BS cells, chandelier cells, bipolar cells, and neurogliaform cells. From this summary, it is clear that all the cell types in layer 2/3 received strong excitation from layer 2/3 (Fig. 7, top) and only weak or no excitatory input from layers 5b and 6. Thus, cell types differed primarily in the extent of excitation that they received from layers 4 and 5a.Summary of excitatory input patterns across all the cell types examined. , A series of cumulative histograms with average percentages of excitatory input (%EI) from all the layers examined (layers 2/3, 4, 5a, 5b, and 6) for all the cell types examined: BS cells, SOM+/CR+ Martinotti cells (MC+), SOM+/CR\u2212 Martinotti cells (MC\u2212), FS basket cells, BC, pyramidal cells (PY), chandelier cells (Chand), neurogliaform cells (NG), RS cells, and IS cells. , A three-dimensional plot that shows average excitatory %EIs of layers 2/3, 4, and 5a for the cell types examined. , Average excitatory EI amplitudes from layers 2/3, 4, and 5a for the cell types examined. Bars represent mean \u00b1 SE.These differences gave rise to three basic patterns of excitatory input for these cell types, which appear as distinct clusters in Figure 7: layer 2/3 dominated input, layer 2/3 and 4 balanced input, weak layer 4 input but strong layer 2/3 and layer 5a input. The first pattern, dominant layer 2/3 excitatory input, was observed for SOM+/CR+ MCs (MC+) and BS cells, as they received >70% of their excitation from layer 2/3 (Fig. 7,). Although these cell types received similar patterns of input, they differed in the absolute strength of input (Fig. 7, top and middle). SOM+/CR+ MCs received significantly stronger input than BS cells from both layers 2/3 and 4 ( < 0.0001).The second excitatory input pattern, balanced excitation from layers 2/3 and 4, was observed for SOM+/CR\u2212 MCs (MC\u2212), FS cells, and bipolar cells (Fig. 7), which, along with pyramidal neurons, constitute another cluster in Figure 7. Like other cell types, this group received strong excitatory input from layer 2/3 (Fig. 7, top). However, they differed from other cell types because of their relatively strong excitatory input from layer 4 (Fig. 7, middle). These cell types received a large proportion of their input from layer 4 based on normalized values (i.e., %EI), and they are also the cell types which received the strongest input from layer 4 before normalization (Fig. 7, middle). FS cells had significantly larger layer 4 EIs than every other inhibitory cell type ( < 0.05), but this was balanced by additional strong excitation from layer 5a. Thus, FS cells fall into the same group as MC\u2212 and bipolar cells based on normalized %EIs despite the fact that they receive stronger input from layer 5a than other cell type in this group (Fig. 7, bottom). A similar pattern was also observed for pyramidal neurons.The final excitatory input pattern, relatively weak excitation from layer 4 flanked by stronger inputs from layers 2/3 and 5a, was observed for chandelier cells, neurogliaform cells, RS cells, and IS cells (Fig. 7). These remaining cell types form a third cluster in Figure 7. All of these cell types, along with FS cells and pyramids (see above), receive stronger absolute EIs from layer 5a than other cell types (Fig. 7, bottom; supplemental Table S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Cell types within this group did not differ significantly from each other but had significantly stronger input from layer 5a than SOM+/CR+ MCs, SOM+/CR\u2212 MCs, BS, and bipolar cells ( < 0.01).To further explore the relationship between the laminar patterns of input to individual cells, independent of cell type, we performed an unsupervised cluster analysis based on the excitatory %EI values from layer 2/3, 4, and 5a for each cell (for further details, see Materials and Methods and supplemental Fig. S4, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). This analysis revealed three main clusters. The laminar inputs to cells in these clusters correspond to the same three patterns (predominantly layer 2/3, layers 2/3 and 5a, layers 2/3 and 4) that were identified above based on the average inputs to cells grouped according to inhibitory cell type. Furthermore, the cell types that fall into each of these three independently generated clusters correspond closely to the expected input patterns based on the average values for each cell type.A summary of the patterns of inhibitory input to each of the 10 cell types is illustrated in Figure 8. Although there were significant differences between cell types in their inhibitory input patterns, these patterns did not separate cell types into groups as clearly as the patterns of excitatory input. Nevertheless, there were trends which we will use to summarize our findings. Examination of Figure 8 reveals that all cell types received strong local inhibition from within layer 2/3, whereas inhibition from layers 4 and 5 varied between cell types. Furthermore, it can be seen that, for a given cell type, inhibition from layer 4 was either very strong or weak, providing the potential to separate cell types into two groups based on this parameter. The dichotomy between cells with very strong versus weak or no layer 4 input is further reinforced by an unsupervised cluster analysis of inhibitory %EI values (see below and supplemental Fig. S4, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). In contrast, the strength of inhibition from layer 5 was clearly not bimodal; across the population of cell types there was a continuum of input strength ranging from zero to very strong. This relatively continuous distribution of layer 5 inhibitory input strengths is also reinforced by cluster analysis.Summary of inhibitory input patterns across all the cell types examined. , Cumulative histograms of percentages of inhibitory input (%EI) from layers 2/3, 4, 5a, 5b, and 6 for all the cell types examined: chandelier cells (Chand), neurogliaform cells (NG), pyramidal cells (PY), FS basket cells, RS cells, BS cells, IS cells, SOM+/CR\u2212 Martinotti cells (MC\u2212), SOM+/CR+ Martinotti cells (MC+), and BC. , A three-dimensional plot that shows average inhibitory %EIs of layers 2/3, 4, and 5 for the cell types examined. In  (unlike in ), the %EIs of layers 5a and 5b were pooled into the %EIs of layer 5. Also note that the recalculated %EIs for layers 2/3 and 4 in  are slightly different than for , but the overall patterns are similar. , Average inhibitory EI amplitudes from layers 2/3, 4, and 5a for the cell types examined. Bars represent mean \u00b1 SE.We will first consider cell types according to whether or not they received strong inhibition from layer 4. Five of the nine inhibitory cell types received weak or no layer 4 input but varied in the strength of inhibition that they received from layer 5. For the majority of these cell types, inhibition from layer 5 was also relatively weak, and they, therefore, received most of their inhibition from layer 2/3 and relatively little inhibition from other layers. The cell types with this inhibitory input pattern included four inhibitory cell types, chandelier, neurogliaform, RS, and BS, as well as pyramidal cells. This can be seen both in the normalized values (Fig. 8) and in the absolute values (Fig. 8). All of these cell types received strong input from layer 2/3, whereas input from layers 4 and 5 was either very weak and/or did not vary significantly from baseline (Fig. 8; supplemental Table S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Although these cell types vary in their inhibitory %EI from layer 5, their relatively strong layer 2/3 and weak layer 4 input places them in a contiguous space within Figure 8 that is separate from the remaining five cell types. The fifth inhibitory cell type with weak (or no) inhibition from layer 4 is the IS cell. Although IS cells are positioned near RS and BS cells in Figure 8, the pattern of inhibitory input to IS cells is unique, as is most clear from the strength of input before normalization (Fig. 8). IS cells received strong inhibition from both layer 2/3 and layer 5 but little or no inhibition from layer 4. Although the position of IS cells in Figure 8 (normalized values) is close to RS and BS cells, IS cells received stronger layer 5 input than either of these cells types (prenormalization).It is noteworthy that four of the five inhibitory cell types receiving weak inhibition from layer 4, all shared a similar pattern of excitatory input from layers 2/3 and 5a, but not layer 4 (chandelier, neurogliaform, RS and IS cells). The remaining cell type, BS cells, also lacked strong excitation from layer 4, suggesting a strong correlation between layer 4 excitation and layer 4 inhibition (see also below).Four inhibitory cell types received strong inhibition from layer 4, and three of these types clearly differed from the fourth in the strength of input from layer 5. These three cell types, SOM+/CR\u2212 MCs (MC\u2212), SOM+/CR+ MCs (MC+) and BCs, all received strong inhibitory input from layer 5, as well as layers 2/3 and 4 (Fig. 8,). These cell types, along with FS cells, received more layer 4 input (Fig. 8, absolute input values) than the other six cell types. This difference was statistically significant for SOM+/CR\u2212 MCs in comparison with all six other cell types ( < 0.05) and for SOM+/CR+ MCs and FS cells compared with five of the six cells types (not for RS cells) ( < 0.05). The stronger layer 4 inhibitory input to bipolar cells was variable across cells within the population and was significant only compared with chandelier, BS, and IS cells ( < 0.05). Although these three inhibitory cell types received inhibition from similar laminar sources, they represent two different groups based on excitatory input sources.The remaining cell type, FS cells, had unique inhibitory input pattern (Fig. 8). Only FS cells received strong inhibition from both layers 2/3 and 4 but not layer 5. This is clear both from the isolated position of FS cells in Figure 8 and from the absolute input values shown in Figure 8, where it can be seen that, unlike other cell types receiving strong inhibition from layer 4, FS cells received essentially no inhibitory input from layer 5. It is again noteworthy that three of the four inhibitory cell types with strong layer 4 inhibition also received strong excitation from layer 4.To further examine the relationship between the laminar patterns of inhibitory input to individual cells, we also performed an unsupervised cluster analysis based on the inhibitory %EI values from layer 2/3, 4, and 5 for each cell (see Materials and Methods and supplemental Fig. S4, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material, for further details). This analysis revealed two main clusters corresponding to cells receiving either very strong layer 4 input versus weak or no layer 4 input. All of the cells in the cluster with strong layer 4 input are the same cell types identified as having strong layer 4 input based on average input patterns for each cell type. Furthermore, all of the individual cells belonging to types which on average have weak or no layer 4 input also fell into the cluster of cells which have weak or no layer 4 input. In contrast to the clear dichotomy based on layer 4 input, clear clusters related to relative strengths of either layer 2/3 or layer 5 inhibitory input did not emerge.Our results reveal diverse sources of excitation and inhibition for many layer 2/3 inhibitory cell types. These different input patterns likely reflect different functional roles within local cortical circuits. In the present study, we found that patterns of excitatory input to layer 2/3 inhibitory neurons fell into three distinct groups (Fig. 7). All inhibitory cell types studied received strong excitation from layer 2/3. Insofar as these same inhibitory cell types provide inhibition to neighboring layer 2/3 neurons, these neurons can be considered to provide feedback inhibition (Fig. 9, left). This potential mechanism is supported by the known synaptic connectivity between layer 2/3 inhibitory cells (e.g., FS cells, IS cells, neurogliaform cells, and multipolar bursting cells) and layer 2/3 pyramids, revealed by dual whole-cell recordings (Blatow et al., 2003; Holmgren et al., 2003; Tam\u00e1s et al., 2003; Galarreta et al., 2004; Simon et al., 2005; Yoshimura and Callaway, 2005). However, this is unlikely to apply to other cell types such as calretinin-immunoreactive interneurons which are preferentially connected to other inhibitory neurons (Meskenaite, 1997; Gonchar and Burkhalter, 1999).Differing excitatory input patterns and their corresponding functional differences in local cortical circuits. A schematic drawing illustrates that (1) the layer 2/3 inhibitory neurons that receive excitatory input from layer 2/3 excitatory pyramidal cells (observed for all cell types examined) have the potential to provide feedback inhibition onto the excitatory pyramidal cells; (2) the layer 2/3 inhibitory neurons such as SOM+/CR\u2212 Martinotti cells (MC\u2212), FS and bipolar cells that also receive strong feedforward excitation from layer 4, have the potential to exert both lemniscal feedforward inhibition and feedback inhibition onto layer 2/3 pyramidal cells; (3) the layer 2/3 inhibitory neurons such as chandelier cells, neurogliaform cells, and IS cells receive strong feedforward excitation from layer 5a, and are thus more directly influenced by the paralemniscal pathway and have the potential to exert both paralemniscal feedforward inhibition and feedback inhibition onto layer 2/3 pyramidal cells.For SOM+/CR+ MCs and BS cells, layer 2/3 was their only source of strong excitatory input (Fig. 9, left). Other cell types, however, received additional strong excitation from either layer 4 or layer 5a but not from both layers. This suggests differences between these cell types in their relationships to the lemniscal pathway [ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM) input to layer 4] versus the paralemniscal pathway [PO (posterior complex) input to layer 5a]. For example, FS cells, SOM+/CR\u2212 MCs, and bipolar cells receive much stronger excitation from layer 4 than from layer 5a; this dominant layer 4 input provides them with the potential to generate more feedforward inhibition related to the lemniscal than to the paralemniscal pathway (Fig. 9, middle). In contrast, IS cells, RS cells, neurogliaform cells, and chandelier cells, which receive stronger excitation from layer 5a than layer 4, can potentially provide feedforward inhibition more strongly related to the paralemniscal pathway (Fig. 9, right). Nevertheless, differential influences of the lemniscal versus paralemniscal pathways should not be taken as evidence for independence. Layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons receive strong lemniscal input from layer 4, and these layer 2/3 pyramids in turn provide excitation to every inhibitory neuron type. Thus, inhibitory neurons receiving strong layer 5a excitatory input are likely to integrate information from both lemniscal and paralemniscal pathways.In this study, we characterized laminar sources of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input to nine different inhibitory cell types and to pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 of mouse S1 cortex. We extended previous observations demonstrating cell type specificity of excitatory connections for just two different classes of inhibitory neurons in rat visual cortex (Dantzker and Callaway, 2000), to provide a more comprehensive view across numerous cell types. We found that similar cell types received similar input patterns in these different cortical areas and species. With analyses of many more inhibitory cell types, we have been able to make novel observations both of general relevance to organization of cortical circuits and of particular relevance to barrel cortex: (1) we found that despite the enormous diversity of cell types, there were only three different laminar excitatory input patterns; (2) we identified a greater diversity of inhibitory input patterns than observed previously and demonstrated that cell type specificity of functional connections is a feature not only of excitatory input but also of inhibitory input; different inhibitory cell types receive inhibition from different cortical layers; (3) although different cell types sometimes received similar patterns of excitatory input, this did not always correlate with the pattern of inhibitory input; different cell types with the same pattern of excitatory input can differ in their patterns of inhibitory input; (4) in the context of the somatosensory system, our observations suggest that distinct inhibitory cell types are differentially influenced by lemniscal versus paralemniscal circuits.Before discussing our findings in detail, it is helpful to consider technical limitations and advantages of our methods. Laser scanning photostimulation is an effective method for identifying the locations of neurons that make direct functional connections to single neurons (Dantzker and Callaway, 2000; Shepherd et al., 2003; Yoshimura and Callaway, 2005; Bureau et al., 2006). As demonstrated in control experiments conducted previously and in the present study (Dantzker and Callaway, 2000; Yoshimura et al., 2005) (supplemental Fig. S5, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), neurons located within 50\u2013100 \u03bcm of the site of glutamate uncaging fire action potentials. Therefore, it can be inferred that evoked synaptic currents reflect direct connections onto the recorded cell, from the cell(s) near the stimulation site. Although 50 \u03bcm is a relatively small distance, in the context of some very small or thin structures, such as layer 5a of the mouse barrel cortex, it is large. Thus, photostimulation sites very near to laminar borders have the potential to activate neurons on the other side of the border, particularly, when cells at the border have dendritic arbors that do not respect the boundary. In the context of our present findings, we suspect that this potential artifact is most likely to influence estimates of functional input from layer 4 when there is strong input from layers 2/3 and 5a. Nevertheless, this could not cause artifactual conclusions about differences in input to different cell types because the stimulation parameters are the same, regardless of what cell type is recorded.Because photostimulation activates all cell types, the cell types which are providing input from a particular location cannot always be distinguished. Because of the great diversity of inhibitory cell types, this issue is most important when considering inhibitory input sources. For example, when different cell types are observed to receive different patterns of inhibitory input, it is clear that there is in fact a true difference. However, when similar input patterns are observed, it remains possible that the cell types from which they receive input could differ, as neurons with similar laminar patterns of inhibition might nevertheless differ in the types of inhibitory cell types that provide that inhibition.Previous studies have provided only very limited data comparing functional connections to different types of inhibitory cortical neurons. These studies have typically distinguished cell types based on their intrinsic firing properties and compare FS cells to some other cell types (Gibson et al., 1999; Dantzker and Callaway, 2000; Gupta et al., 2000). Nevertheless, even these observations have been sufficient to demonstrate that different types of inhibitory cells receive excitatory input from different sources. Studies of input from VPM to layer 4 in the mouse S1 cortex have revealed that these connections preferentially target FS cells relative to low threshold spiking cells (Gibson et al., 1999). Studies of local input to layer 2/3 neurons in rat visual cortex demonstrated differences in excitatory input to FS cells versus non-FS cells (Dantzker and Callaway, 2000).FS cells in visual cortex of both rats (Dantzker and Callaway, 2000) and mice (our unpublished observations) receive strong excitation from layers 2/3 and 4 and weaker input from deep layers. In mouse S1 cortex, we found that layer 2/3 FS cells also received a similar pattern of local excitation. The conservation of excitatory input patterns of FS cells likely reflects a common role for these neurons in providing feedforward inhibition. In both S1 barrel cortex and in visual cortex, strong thalamic input to layer 4 is transferred by layer 4 spiny neurons to layer 2/3 pyramids. The concurrent excitation of FS cells by the same layer 4 spiny neurons, as well as strong connectivity from FS cells to layer 2/3 pyramids, is generally accepted as an important mechanism for providing gain control in this pathway (Swadlow, 2003; Cruikshank et al., 2007). Furthermore, these same FS cells also provide additional gain control through feedback inhibition via their reciprocal connections with layer 2/3 pyramids (Holmgren et al., 2003; Yoshimura and Callaway, 2005).Observations of local excitatory input to non-FS cells in rat visual cortex revealed two different input patterns, but no further distinctions were made between these cells (Dantzker and Callaway, 2000). Approximately half of the non-FS cells received strong excitatory input predominantly from layer 2/3 in rat visual cortex. In the present study, we found a similar pattern of excitatory input for some non-FS inhibitory cell types including SOM+/CR+ MCs and BS cells in mouse S1 cortex. However, for other non-FS cells such as SOM+/CR\u2212 MCs and bipolar cells, we found that they received relatively balanced input from both layers 2/3 and 4, with weak input from deep layers. Interestingly, although the remaining non-FS cells in rat visual cortex are found to receive much stronger excitation from layer 5 than from superficial layers, we did not observe such an input pattern for any cell type in the present sample from mouse S1. This could reflect differences in sampling bias between these studies or differences between cortical areas or species.Biasing recordings toward GFP-expressing neurons in transgenic mice enabled us to sample many additional inhibitory cell types and to reveal novel input patterns. The most striking pattern of excitation involved relatively weak input from layer 4 flanked by strong input from layers 2/3 and 5a. This pattern was observed for all four of the remaining inhibitory cell types in our sample, including IS cells, RS cells, neurogliaform cells, and chandelier cells. We also observed for the first time that cell types differ systematically in their laminar sources of inhibition. Importantly, inhibitory input to inhibitory cells is not predictable from their excitatory input sources. For example, the two subtypes of MCs had different excitatory input patterns, but they received similar patterns of inhibitory input from layers 2/3, 4, and 5. Moreover, RS, IS, neurogliaform and chandelier cells had similar excitatory input sources, but they had different inhibitory input patterns. IS cells received matched excitation and inhibition from upper and deeper layers, but RS, neurogliaform and chandelier cells received inhibition mostly from layer 2/3. Despite the lack of a one-to-one correlation between patterns of excitation and inhibition, there was a strong trend for layer 4 inhibition to be correlated with layer 4 excitation.Overall, our observations indicate differences in both excitatory and inhibitory connectivity to different types of layer 2/3 inhibitory neurons. Based on these observations, it is possible to infer likely differences between the functional influences of each inhibitory cell type (Fig. 9). However, because of the complexity within multisynaptic dynamic networks, a clear understanding of the functional roles of each inhibitory cell type within the intact network will require more extensive knowledge about each inhibitory cell type as well as  studies. For example, the net effect of excitation or inhibition of any given inhibitory cell type depends in turn on the postsynaptic cells and cell types that are targeted by the inhibitory cell type. Here, we have provided crucial new information about the laminar sources of excitatory and inhibitory input to a large number of inhibitory cell types in cortical layer 2/3. Future studies should investigate not only the sources of input to each cell type, as we have described here, but also the specificity of their outputs. Furthermore, the properties of synaptic connections and functional influences within a network can shift dynamically . Regardless, the connectivity observed in living brain slices is an important step toward understanding inhibitory cortical circuits and serves as a guide for interpreting possible  interactions.This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants MH063912 (E.M.C.), EY010742 (E.M.C.), and K99DA023700 (X.X.).

The primary events triggered by dietary fats that ultimately lead to hypothalamic cytokine expression and inflammatory signaling are unknown. Here, we test the hypothesis that dietary fats act through the activation of toll-like receptors 2/4 and endoplasmic reticulum stress to induce cytokine expression in the hypothalamus of rodents. According to our results, long-chain saturated fatty acids activate predominantly toll-like receptor 4 signaling, which determines not only the induction of local cytokine expression but also promotes endoplasmic reticulum stress. Rats fed on a monounsaturated fat-rich diet do not develop hypothalamic leptin resistance, whereas toll-like receptor 4 loss-of-function mutation and immunopharmacological inhibition of toll-like receptor 4 protects mice from diet-induced obesity. Thus, toll-like receptor 4 acts as a predominant molecular target for saturated fatty acids in the hypothalamus, triggering the intracellular signaling network that induces an inflammatory response, and determines the resistance to anorexigenic signals.The consumption of fat-rich diets is among the most important environmental factors predisposing to obesity in modern societies (Stein and Colditz, 2004; Freire et al., 2005; Moreno and Rodr\u00edguez, 2007). In animal models of genetic and diet-induced obesity, the activation of an inflammatory response in the hypothalamus leads to the molecular and functional resistance to the adipostatic hormones, leptin and insulin, resulting in a defective control of food intake and energy expenditure (Carvalheira et al., 2003; Howard et al., 2004; De Souza et al., 2005). Reversal of these effects can be achieved by distinct genetic and pharmacological approaches, aimed at inhibiting inflammatory signaling (Howard et al., 2004; De Souza et al., 2005).Recent studies have provided strong evidence for the contribution of toll-like receptor (TLR) activation and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) induction as mechanisms linking the consumption of high-fat diets and obesity to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (Ozcan et al., 2004, 2006; Shi et al., 2006; Tsukumo et al., 2007). TLRs are highly conserved members of the interleukin-1 receptor superfamily that respond to microbial signature motifs, leading to the activation of innate immune responses (Akira, 2003; Akira et al., 2006). Four members of the TLR family, TLR1, 2, 4, and 6, are known to recognize lipid-containing motifs; TLR1/2 dimmers recognize diacyl lipopeptides, TLR2/6 dimmers recognize triacyl lipopeptides and TLR4 recognizes lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The activation of TLR signaling leads to the coordinated induction of cytokine and other immune-related genes expression (Shimazu et al., 1999; Takeuchi et al., 2001; Akira, 2003; Akira et al., 2006).The ER is the organelle responsible for the synthesis and processing of membrane and secretory proteins (Xu et al., 2005). Under certain harmful conditions, the ER homeostasis is disrupted, leading to the accumulation of misfolded and unfolded proteins in the ER lumen (Schr\u00f6der and Kaufman, 2005; Xu et al., 2005). To deal with this condition, the affected cells activate a complex signaling system known as the unfolded protein response (UPR), aimed at preserving cell integrity while the harmful condition persists (Schr\u00f6der and Kaufman, 2005; Xu et al., 2005). One of the outcomes of the activation of UPR is the induction of the expression of cytokines and proteins involved in immune surveillance (Krappmann et al., 2004; Marciniak and Ron, 2006). In addition to classical activation by viruses and bacteria (Watowich et al., 1991; Pahl and Baeuerle, 1995), ER stress can be induced by metabolic and nutritional factors such as high levels of glucose and lipids (Ozcan et al., 2004; Nakatani et al., 2005; Ozawa et al., 2005).Cytokines, induced either by TLR activation and/or by ER stress, can play a pathogenetic role in the development of insulin resistance in peripheral tissues (Ozcan et al., 2004, 2006; Shi et al., 2006; Tsukumo et al., 2007). To explore the hypothesis that fatty acids can trigger an inflammatory response in the hypothalamus by inducing TLR activation and/or ER stress, we determined the molecular and functional outcomes of intracerebroventricular injection of fatty acids in rodents. Our results show that long-chain saturated fatty acids act predominantly through TLR4 and suggest that ER stress is a downstream event in the cascade that ultimately leads to inflammatory activation in the hypothalamus.Antibodies against TNF-\u03b1 (s.c.-1347, goat polyclonal and s.c.-8301, rabbit polyclonal), IL-1\u03b2 (s.c.-1252, goat polyclonal and s.c.-7884 rabbit polyclonal), IL-6 (s.c.-1266, goat polyclonal and s.c.-7920, rabbit polyclonal), IL-10 (s.c.-1783, goat polyclonal), eIF2\u03b1 (s.c.-11386, rabbit polyclonal), RNA-dependent protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) (s.c.-13073, rabbit polyclonal), phosphor[Thr981]-PERK (pPERK, s.c.-32577, rabbit polyclonal), GRP78 (s.c.-13968, rabbit polyclonal), c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) (s.c.-46009, goat polyclonal), phosphor[Thr183/Tyr185] JNK (pJNK, sc12882, rabbit polyclonal), F4/80 (s.c.-25830, rabbit polyclonal), proopiomelanocortin (POMC) (s.c.-20148, rabbit polyclonal), agouti-related protein (AgRP) (s.c.-50299, rabbit polyclonal), TLR2 (s.c.-10739, rabbit polyclonal and s.c.-16237, goat polyclonal), TLR4 (s.c.-16240 goat polyclonal and s.c.-13591, rat monoclonal), and MyD88 (s.c.-11356, rabbit polyclonal) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

In some experiments, rats were intracerebroventricularly treated with oleic acid alone (225 \u03bcm) in parallel with a mixture of fatty acids containing palmitic, stearic, arachidic, and behenic acids (25% each, to a final concentration of 225 mm), referred to as the saturated mixture (SM); or SM (20%) plus oleic (20%), linoleic (30%), and linolenic (30%) acids (to a final concentration of 225 mm), referred to as the vegetable mixture (VM). LPS contamination of the fatty acids, HBP and BSA preparations were evaluated by Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay produced by Associates of Cape Cod. LPS in the diets were evaluated by HPLC as described below. Only trace amounts of LPS (ranging from 0.026 to 0.075 EU/nmol) were detected in the reagents. According to a previously study (Weinstein et al., 2008), these levels of LPS do not interfere with the results. Nevertheless, to assure that signal transduction through TLR2 and TLR4 would not be activated by these amounts of LPS, rats were intracerebroventricularly treated with 2.0 \u03bcl solution containing 3.0 or 300 ng LPS (corresponding to the amounts of LPS equivalent to 0.075 and 7.5 EU/nmol, respectively), and signal transduction was determined by immunoblot, as described below and presented in Figure 2.Male Wistar rats and male TLR4 loss-of-function mutant (C3H/HeJ) mice and their respective controls (C3H/HeN) were used in the experiments. The investigation followed the University guidelines for the use of animals in experimental studies and conforms to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH publication No. 85\u201323 revised 1996). The animals were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle and housed in individual cages. For intracerebroventricular cannulation, 8-week-old rats with a body mass of 250\u2013300 g or mice with a body mass of 25\u201330 g were used. For evaluation of the effects of distinct diets on metabolic and inflammatory parameters, rats were fed from the 4th to 20th weeks of life on CD or HF diets (experiments presented in Fig. 1) or on CD, HF, or OL diets from the 6th to 14th weeks of life (experiments presented in Figs. 8, 9). C3H/HeJ and C3H/HeN mice were fed on HF diet from the 8th to 16th weeks of life (experiments presented in Fig. 8). Pharmacological inhibition of TLR2 and TLR4 was achieved by a daily intraperitoneal injection of 100 \u03bcl solution containing 1.0 \u03bcg IgG of anti-TLR2 or anti-TLR4 antibodies (see Fig. 8), or by a daily intracerebroventricular injection of 2.0 \u03bcl solution containing 0.4 \u03bcg IgG of anti-TLR2 or anti-TLR4 antibodies (see Figs. 4, 6, 9). Pharmacological inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress was achieved by a daily intraperitoneal injection of 1.0 g/kg PBA (see Fig. 8) or by a daily intracerebroventricular injection of 1.0 mg PBA (see Figs. 5, 6).Eight-week-old C3H/HeJ and C3H/HeN mice, fed on control diet, were injected intraperitoneally with a single dose of 2% (w/v) sodium thioglycolate (Sigma-Aldrich), and after 2 d, the animals received a lethal dose of anesthetics (sodium thiopental 20 mg/kg) followed by 2.0 ml PBS into the peritoneal cavity to recover the macrophages. Primary cultures were obtained by plating the macrophages at an initial density of 105 cells/ml Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640, in 1.5 cm culture dishes. After 30 min, the macrophages were treated, for 16 h, with one of the following conditions: 22.5 mm arachidic acid; 22.5 mm arachidic acid plus 5.0 mm PBA or diluent. At the end of the incubation period, the macrophages were harvested and resuspended in PBS containing 10% fatty acid free BSA. For F4/80 labeling, the cells were not submitted to any fixation and permeabilization protocol. For the remainder of the proteins (p-JNK, p-PERK, p-elF2\u03b1, and GRP78), cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% saponin. Primary antibodies were used in a final concentration of 2.5 \u03bcg/ml and the secondary, FITC conjugated, antibody was used in a final dilution of 1:100. Signal detection was performed in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer equipped with an argon laser, and analysis of data were performed with the CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Differences are presented as percent variation of control.Determination of lipids and LPS in diets was performed using a method described previously (Martins et al., 2004). Briefly, fatty acids were derivatized with 4-bromomethyl-7-coumarin and the analysis performed in a Shimadzu model LC-10A liquid chromatographer. The samples were eluted using a C8 column (25 cm \u00d7 4.6 id, 5 \u03bcm of particles) with a C8 precolumn (2.5 cm \u00d7 4.6 id, 5 \u03bcm of particles), 1.0 ml/min of acetonitrile/water (77%/23%, v/v) flow and fluorescence detector (325 nm excitation and 395 nm emission). For quantification of fatty acids, the capacity factor, elution sequence, linearity, recovery, precision, interference, and limit of detection were determined. The lower limit of detection was 1.0 pg. Highly purified LPS was used as a tracer.Hydrated, 5.0 \u03bcm sections of paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded CNS specimens were obtained from rats treated for 8 or 16 weeks with CD or HF diets. The expression of F4/80 and the coimmunolocalization of TLR4 with F4/80, AgRP, and POMC were evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence staining, as described previously (Bertelli et al., 2006). The expression of F4/80 was evaluated in hypothalamus, frontal, parietal, occipital and cerebellar cortexes, thalamus and hippocampus. The coimmunolocalizations were determined in the hypothalamus.Standard reverse-transcription PCR was performed using total RNA from hypothalamic samples as described previously (Bertelli et al., 2006). The primers used for the amplification of XBP-1 (GenBank accession number, AF443192) were as follows: forward, 5\u2032-AAA CAG AGT AGC AGC GCA GAC TGC-3\u2032; reverse, 5\u2032-GGA TCT CTA AAA CTA GAG GCT TGG TG-3\u2032. Products were digested with I, and the products were separated on agarose gels and visualized by Cyber Gold staining.IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 mRNAs were measured in the hypothalami of rats treated with CD or HF diets and in intracerebroventricular cannulated rats treated with arachidic acid in the presence or absence of the TLR2 or TLR4 receptor-inhibiting antibodies. Alternatively, these procedures were performed in the presence or absence of the ER stress inhibitor, PBA. In some experiments, C3H/HeJ and C3H/HeN mice were intracerebroventricularly cannulated and treated with arachidic acid or diluent for 3 d. Intron-skipping primers were obtained from Applied Biosystems: TNF-\u03b1, Rn00562055_m1; IL-1\u03b2, Rn00580432_m1; IL-6, Rn00561420; IL-10, Rn00563409 for rats; or, TNF-\u03b1, Mm00443258_m1; IL-1\u03b2, Mm00434228_m1; IL-6, Mm99999064; IL-10, Mm00439615 for mice. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers (Applied Biosystems) were used as control: #4352338E for rats, and #4352339E for mice. Real-time PCR analysis of gene expression was performed in an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The optimal concentration of cDNA and primers, as well as the maximum efficiency of amplification, were obtained through five-point, twofold dilution curve analysis for each gene. Each PCR contained 3.0 ng of reverse-transcribed RNA, 200 nm of each specific primer, SYBR SAFE PCR master mix, and RNase free water to a 20 \u03bcl final volume. Real-time data were analyzed using the Sequence Detector System 1.7 (Applied Biosystems).For evaluation of cytokine expression, TLR activation and ER stress induction, the hypothalami of anesthetized rats were excised and immediately homogenized in solubilization buffer at 4\u00b0C. Aliquots of the resulting protein extract containing 2.0 mg of total protein were used for immunoprecipitation with antibodies against TLR2, TLR4, and MyD88 at 4\u00b0C overnight, followed by SDS-PAGE transfer to nitrocellulose membranes and blotting with anti-TLR2, anti-TLR4, or anti-MyD88 antibodies. In direct immunoblot experiments, 0.2 mg of protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blotted with anti-TNF-\u03b1, anti-IL-1\u03b2, anti-IL-6, anti-IL-10, anti-pJNK, anti-JNK, anti-pPERK, anti-PERK, anti-GRP78, and anti-peIF2\u03b1. Specific bands were detected by chemiluminescence, and visualization was performed by exposure of the membranes to RX-films.Specific protein bands present in the blots and cDNA bands in agarose gels were quantified by digital densitometry (ScionCorp). Mean values \u00b1 SEM obtained from densitometry scans and from real-time PCR, XBP-1 splicing measurements, body mass determination, and food intake were compared using Tukey\u2013Kramer test (ANOVA) or Student's  test, as appropriate;  < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.In the first part of the study, Wistar rats were treated either with a CD containing 4.0 g% total fat (2.0 g% saturated fat, as determined by HPLC), or an HF, containing 36.0 g% total fat (5.0 g% saturated fat, as determined by HPLC). Consumption of the HF diet for 16 weeks led to a significant increase in the expression of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, but not of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, in the hypothalamus (Fig. 1). These effects were accompanied by an increased expression of the F4/80 antigen in cells present mostly in the medial eminence and arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, but not in all other anatomical sites of the brain examined (frontal, parietal, occipital and cerebellar cortexes, thalamus and hippocampus) (Fig. 1)., Immunoblot (IB) analysis of expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-10 in hypothalamic protein extracts obtained from 4 (4 w)- and 20 (20 w)-week old rats fed on CD and HF diets for 16 weeks, starting at 4 weeks of age. , Immunofluorescence staining of F4/80 in the CNS of rats fed on CD and HF diets for 16 weeks; representative microphotographs were obtained from hypothalamic periventricular (3v) zone, in the first and second panels from the left; dorsal third ventricular (D3v) zone, in the third panel from the left; dentate gyrus zone (DG), in the fourth panel from the left; and granular layer of cerebellum, in the fifth panel from the left. In ,  = 5; results are presented as arbitrary scanning units (ASU) \u00b1SEM, * < 0.05 versus respective control. , Microphotographs are representative of three distinct experiments; nuclei are stained with DAPI.To determine the direct effect of different fatty acids in the expression of inflammatory proteins in hypothalamus, rats were intracerebroventricularly cannulated and treated, initially, with the monounsaturated fatty acid, oleic acid or with fatty acid mixtures containing predominantly fatty acids present in VM, or in animal fat (SM). First, to evaluate if the trace amounts of LPS detected in the reagents could interfere with the results by activating TLR2/4 signaling, we treated rats for 3 d with a dose of LPS corresponding to the highest contaminating level determined in our reagents. As depicted in Figure 2, 3.0 ng LPS, corresponding to 0.075 EU/nmol endotoxin activity, produced no effect on TLR2 or TLR4 signal transduction. Three days intracerebroventricular oleic acid treatment produced significant increases in the expression of IL-6 and IL-10, as determined by immunoblot (Fig. 2) and real-time PCR (Fig. 2). VM produced a significant increase of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, as determined by immunoblot (Fig. 2), and significant increases in IL-6 and IL-10, as determined by real-time PCR (Fig. 2). SM produced significant increases in the expressions in TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, as determined by immunoblot (Fig. 2), and IL-6 as determined by real-time PCR (Fig. 2). To further understand the role of each individual fatty acid type to induce cytokine expression in the hypothalamus, rats were intracerebroventricularly treated for 3 d with palmitic, stearic, linoleic, linolenic, arachidic, or behenic acids. As depicted in Figure 2, the long-chain saturated fatty acids, mostly stearic, arachidic and behenic, induced the expression of inflammatory cytokines. In the case of stearic and arachidic, some stimulus for the expression of IL-10 was also detected., Immunoprecipitation/immunoblot (IP/IB) analysis of the associations of TLR2 and TLR4 with MyD88 in hypothalamic protein extracts obtained from rats treated intracerebroventricularly with diluent (DL), 3.0 ng LPS (LPS3), or 300 ng LPS (LPS300) for 3 d. , Immunoblot (IB) analysis of expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-10 in hypothalamic protein extracts obtained from rats treated intracerebroventricularly with diluent (DL), oleic acid (C18:1), VM (as presented in Materials and Methods), or SM (as presented in Materials and Methods). , Real-time PCR determination of IL-6 and IL-10 mRNA expression in hypothalamic samples obtained from rats treated intracerebroventricularly with diluent (DL), oleic acid (C18:1), VM or SM. , Immunoblot analysis of expressions of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-10 in hypothalamic protein extracts obtained from rats treated intracerebroventricularly with diluent (DL), palmytic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0), linoleic acid (C18:2), linolenic acid (C18:3), arachidic acid (C20:0), and behenic acid (C22:0). In all experiments,  = 5; in  and , results are presented as arbitrary scanning units (ASU) \u00b1SEM, * < 0.05 versus respective control; in , results are presented as transcript amount, and different letters refer to significant differences between groups,  < 0.05.To evaluate the effect of long-chain saturated fatty acids on the induction of ER stress, rats were intracerebroventricularly treated from 1 to 3 d with two daily doses of arachidic acid and the expressions of proteins induced during the UPR were determined by immunoblot. As depicted in Figure 3, UPR was rapidly induced in the hypothalamus of arachidic acid-treated rats. The expressions of the phosphorylated forms of JNK, PERK and eIF2\u03b1 and the protein amount of GRP78 were clearly increased after 1\u20132 d treatment, reaching the highest levels on day 3 (23 \u00b1 4 vs 203 \u00b1 18* for pJNK, 14 \u00b1 3 vs 265 \u00b1 21* for pPERK, 12 \u00b1 4 vs 205 \u00b1 16 for GRP78, and 19 \u00b1 8 vs 229 \u00b1 21 for peIF2\u03b1;  = 5; * < 0.05). No induction of UPR was detected in the hypothalamus of control rats. In addition, the increased ratios of spliced/total (0.61 \u00b1 0.07 vs 0.84 \u00b1 0.09;  = 5;  < 0.05) and spliced/nonspliced XBP-1 (0.49 \u00b1 0.04 vs 0.81 \u00b1 0.07;  = 5;  < 0.05) transcripts further confirmed the ability of arachidic acid to induce ER stress. The capacity of arachidic acid to induce signal transduction through TLR2 and TLR4 in the hypothalamus was tested in rats intracerebroventricularly treated for 3 d with this fatty acid. As shown in Figure 3, both TLR2/MyD88 and TLR4/MyD88 associations/activations were induced by the long-chain saturated fatty acid. The greatest effect was seen on TLR4/MyD88 association, which was 5.6-fold (1234 \u00b1 102 vs 222 \u00b1 34 arbitrary scanning units;  = 5;  < 0.05) more stimulated than TLR2/MyD88, suggesting that TLR4 is the main receptor engaged by the long-chain saturated fatty acid., Immunoblot (IB) analysis of the expressions of pJNK, JNK, pPERK, PERK, GRP78, and peIF2\u03b1 in hypothalamic protein extracts obtained from rats treated intracerebroventricularly with diluent (DL) or arachidic acid (C20:0) for 1\u20133 d; some rats were intracerebroventricularly cannulated but received no treatment (\u2212). , Immunoprecipitation (IP) analysis of the associations of TLR2 and TLR4 with MyD88 in hypothalamic protein extracts obtained from nonintracerebroventricular cannulated (CT) rats, and rats treated intracerebroventricularly with DL or C20:0 for 3 d. The depicted blots are representative of five distinct experiments.To determine the impact of TLR2, TLR4, and ER stress activation, by long-chain saturated fatty acids, on induction of an inflammatory response in the hypothalamus, specific inhibitors of TLR2, TLR4, and ER stress were used. The inhibition of TLR2 was achieved by intracerebroventricularly treating the rats with a daily dose of an inhibitory TLR2 antibody. This treatment completely blunted arachidic acid-induced activation of TLR2 signaling (Fig. 4) but promoted no modulation of arachidic acid-induced activation of TLR4 (Fig. 4) or induction of ER stress (Fig. 4). Conversely, the inhibition of TLR4 by a daily intracerebroventricular dose of an inhibitory TLR4 antibody completely abolished TLR4 activation (Fig. 4) and ER stress induction (Fig. 4), including the inhibition of the arachidic acid-induced increase in the spliced form of XBP-1 (Fig. 4). No significant modulation of TLR2 activation was obtained by this approach (Fig. 4). When rats were intracerebroventricularly treated with a daily dose of the chaperone PBA to inhibit ER stress, only the reversal of arachidic acid-induced ER stress was obtained (Fig. 5), with no impact on TLR2 and TLR4 activation (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the inhibition of TLR4 signaling by the TLR4-inhibiting antibody completely restrained the capacity of arachidic acid to induce TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10 expression (Fig. 6). However, PBA treatment only partially inhibited arachidic acid-induced expression of these cytokines (Fig. 6), suggesting that ER stress induction mediates only part of the signals generated by the long-chain saturated fatty acid toward cytokine expression., Immunoprecipitation (IP) analysis of the associations of TLR2 and TLR4 with MyD88 in hypothalamic protein extracts obtained from rats not intracerebroventricularly cannulated (CT), and rats treated intracerebroventricularly with diluent (DL), arachidic acid (C20:0), TLR2 receptor antibody plus arachidic acid (T2rAb+C20:0) or TLR4 receptor antibody plus arachidic acid (T4rAb+C20:0) for 3 d. , Immunoblot (IB) analysis of expression of pJNK, JNK, pPERK, PERK, GRP78 and peIF2\u03b1 in hypothalamic protein extracts. , PCR analysis of spliced/total XBP-1 transcripts in hypothalamic samples.

The results are presented as transcript amount,  = 5, and different letters mean significant differences between groups,  < 0.05.To evaluate if the phenomenon described above, in the hypothalamus, could be reproduced in isolated cells, peritoneal macrophages prepared from control (C3H/HeN) and TLR4 loss-of-function mutation (C3H/HeJ) mice were treated for 16 h with arachidic acid, and the activation of markers of ER stress was determined by flow cytometry. Initially, the specificity of the method was tested by treating the cells from C3H/HeN mice with PBA to chemically inhibit ER stress induction. As shown in Figure 7, PBA was unable to inhibit arachidic acid-induced F4/80 expression but almost completely blunted fatty acid-induced activation of p-JNK (89 \u00b1 6%;  < 0.05), p-eIF2\u03b1 (93 \u00b1 4%;  < 0.05), p-PERK (79 \u00b1 5%;  < 0.05) and GRP78 (93 \u00b1 4%;  < 0.05). When macrophages from C3H/HeJ mice were submitted to a similar treatment, an almost complete inhibition of arachidic acid-induced expression of F4/80 (86 \u00b1 4%;  < 0.05), p-JNK (88 \u00b1 5%;  < 0.05), and GRP78 (95 \u00b1 4%;  < 0.05), a partial inhibition of arachidic acid-induced expression of p-eIF2\u03b1 (58 \u00b1 9%;  < 0.05) and p-PERK (69 \u00b1 5,  < 0.05), were observed (Fig. 7).Flow cytometry analysis of expressions of F4/80, p-JNK, p-elf2\u03b1, p-PERK, and GRP78 in isolated macrophages. , Macrophages from C3H/HeN mice were plated and incubated for 16 h in the presence of arachidic acid (blue), arachidic acid plus PBA (orange) or diluent (red).

Signal detection was performed by flow cytometry. , Macrophages from C3H/HeN and C3H/HeJ mice were plated and incubated for 16 h in the presence of arachidic acid (blue) or diluent (red).

Graphs are representative of  = 5. Background counts (black); control, not added primary antibody (green).As one of the main molecular mechanisms linking the consumption of fat-rich diets to insulin and leptin resistance in peripheral and hypothalamic tissues is the induction of an inflammatory response and the expression/action of inflammatory cytokines, we tested the hypothesis that only the consumption of a saturated fatty acid-rich, and not of an isocaloric unsaturated fatty acid-rich diet, would promote resistance to anorexigenic signals in the hypothalamus. For this, Wistar rats were treated for 8 weeks with CD, HF, or OL diets and evaluated for metabolic parameters and response to intracerebroventricularly injected leptin. The OL diet is isocaloric with HF but contains less saturated fat, as determined by HPLC (HF contains 5.0 g% saturated fat, whereas OL contains 2.8 g% saturated fat). As shown in Figure 8, the consumption of either HF or OL diets led to similar changes in body mass (Fig. 8) and mean daily caloric intake (data not shown). However, whereas in HF fed rats intracerebroventricular leptin promoted no suppression of food intake, in OL rats, the effect of leptin was similar to controls (Fig. 8), leading to a 38% reduction in spontaneous food intake over 12 h. In addition, when rats fed for 8 weeks on either HF or OL diets were moved to CD diet for a further 4 weeks, the rate of body mass gain was significantly reduced in previously OL fed rats, whereas in previously HF fed rats, the rate was still higher than control (Fig. 8)., Rats were fed on CD, HF, or OL diets for 8 weeks; body mass variation () was determined during the experimental period. At the end of the experimental period, rats were treated intraperitoneally with saline (100 \u03bcl) (\u2212) or a similar volume of leptin (10\u22126 m) (+), and spontaneous food intake was determined over 12 h (). After 8 weeks on either diet, HF and OL rats were reallocated to CD diet for a further 4 weeks, and body mass variation was determined (). , C3H/HeN and C3H/HeJ mice were fed on a saturated-rich high-fat diet for 8 weeks, and body mass was determined in the first (0w) and last days (8w) of the experimental periods. , , Real-time PCR determination of IL-6 () and IL-10 () mRNA expressions in hypothalamic samples obtained from C3H/HeN and C3H/HeJ mice nonintracerebroventricularly canullated (CT), or treated intracerebroventricularly with diluent (DL) or arachidic acid (C20:0). , Double-immunofluorescence staining of TLR4 and F4/80 in the arcuate nucleus of rats fed on high-fat diet for 8 weeks, the arrows depict double-positive cells. , Immunoprecipitation (IP) analysis of the associations of TLR2 and TLR4 with MyD88 in hypothalamic protein extracts obtained from rats fed on CD or HF diets for 8 weeks. , , Rats were fed on CD or HF diets for 8 weeks. Throughout the period, the rats were treated with a daily intraperitoneal dose of PBA (HF+PBA), TLR2-inhibiting antibody (HF+T2rAb), or TLR4-inhibiting antibody (HF+T4rAb). Body mass variation () was determined. At the end of the experimental period, rats were treated intraperitoneally with saline (100 \u03bcl) (\u2212) or a similar volume of leptin (10\u22126 m) (+), and spontaneous food intake was determined over 12 h (). , Real-time PCR determination of TNF-\u03b1 (), IL-1\u03b2 (), IL-6 () and IL-10 () mRNA expressions in hypothalamic samples obtained from rats treated according to the same protocol as for , .

The depicted blots are representative of five distinct experiments.To test the hypothesis that TLR4 mediates most of the effect of dietary saturated fatty acids toward hypothalamic inflammation and impairment of anorexigenic signals, TLR4 loss-of-function mutant mice were fed on an HF diet for 8 weeks and metabolic parameters were determined. As depicted in Figure 8, whereas control mice presented a 50% body mass gain during the period, the body mass of mutant mice increased by only 30% in the same period. This effect was independent of any significant change in food intake. In addition, TLR4 loss-of-function mutant mice failed to induce a remarkable increase in the expression of IL-6 and IL-10 in hypothalamus, after a 3 d intracerebroventricular treatment with arachidic acid (Fig. 8,).The cellular distribution of TLR4 in the hypothalamus was evaluated by double-immunofluorescence staining of hypothalamic sections obtained from Wistar rats fed on HF diet for 8 weeks. Most TLR4-positive cells were microglia cells expressing the F4/80 protein (Fig. 8). AgRP and POMC neurons expressed virtually no TLR4 (data not shown).The associations of TLR2 and TLR4 with MyD88 were significantly increased in the hypothalamus of rats fed on HF diet from 8 weeks. As depicted in Figure 8, HF diet led to 123 \u00b1 14% ( < 0.05) increase in the association TLR2/MyD88 and 321 \u00b1 23% ( < 0.05) increase in the association TLR4/MyD88.To determine the impact of TLR2/4 activity and ER stress on diet-induced obesity and hypothalamic leptin resistance, Wistar rats were fed on a HF diet for 8 weeks and treated with daily intraperitoneal doses of TLR2-inhibiting antibody, TLR4-inhibiting antibody, or PBA. As shown in Figure 8, TLR4, but not TLR2 or ER stress inhibitions, completely abolished diet-induced body mass gain independently of significant changes in food intake (data not shown). In addition, TLR4, but not TLR2 and ER stress, inhibition reversed diet-induced leptin resistance in the hypothalamus (Fig. 8). These effects were accompanied by significant reductions of hypothalamic TNF-\u03b1 (Fig. 8), IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 8), IL-6 (Fig. 8), and IL-10 (Fig. 8) expressions by the inhibition of TLR4. Similar results were obtained by inhibiting TLR4 only in the hypothalamus. For that, Wistar rats were fed on HF diet for 8 weeks. During the last 7 d of the protocol, the rats were treated with a daily intracerebroventricular dose of TLR4- or TLR2-inhibiting antibodies. As shown in Figure 9, only the inhibition of TLR4 was capable of significantly reducing body mass variation. This was accompanied by significant reductions of TNF-\u03b1 (Fig. 9), IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 9), IL-6 (Fig. 9), and IL-10 (Fig. 9) expressions., Rats were fed on high-fat diet for 8 weeks. During the last 7 d of the protocol, the rats were intracerebroventricularly treated with saline (HF), TLR2-inhibiting antibody (HF+T2rAb), or TLR4-inhibiting antibody (HF+T4rAb). Body mass change was measured over the 7 d (). At the end of the experimental period, hypothalami were obtained for real-time PCR analysis of TNF-\u03b1 (), IL-1\u03b2 (), IL-6 (), and IL-10 () mRNA determination. In all experiments,  = 5; different letters mean significant differences between groups,  < 0.05.Molecular and functional resistance to anorexigenic/thermogenic signaling in the hypothalamus is a common feature of most animal models of obesity (Carvalheira et al., 2003; Howard et al., 2004; De Souza et al., 2005; M\u00fcnzberg and Myers, 2005; Enriori et al., 2007). The main molecular events determining this phenotype are the systemic and local production of cytokines (Howard et al., 2004; De Souza et al., 2005) and the activation of inflammatory pathways in cells of restricted areas of the hypothalamus involved in the control of feeding and thermogenesis (Howard et al., 2004; De Souza et al., 2005; Prada et al., 2005; Ara\u00fajo et al., 2007). Although it is generally accepted that consumption of fat-rich diets is among the most important environmental factors leading to obesity, little is known about the mechanisms linking dietary fats to the activation of inflammatory response and impairment of anorexigenic/thermogenic signaling in the hypothalamus. Recently, the activation of TLR signaling and the induction of ER stress have been implicated in the pathogenesis of diet- and obesity-related insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus. In this study, we evaluated the capacity of fatty acids to induce TLR signaling and ER stress in the hypothalamus (Ozcan et al., 2004, 2006; Shi et al., 2006; Tsukumo et al., 2007).Initially, we determined the ability of different fatty acids to induce the expression of cytokines in the hypothalamus. The HF diet contained as much as twofold more saturated fat than the control diet. This is consistent with the amount of saturated fat present in most Western diets and is much beyond that recommended by the guidelines of diabetes, nutrition, and cardiovascular international societies (Shekelle et al., 1981; McKeigue et al., 1985; Dougherty et al., 1988). The rats fed on the HF diet expressed high levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 in the hypothalamus, and this was accompanied by the increased presence of F4/80-expressing cells, predominantly in the medium eminence and arcuate nucleus. These data reinforce the concept that consumption of a fat-rich diet induces an inflammatory response in hypothalamus and suggests that the activation of an innate immune response is implicated in the process (De Souza et al., 2005). Moreover, by ruling out the expression of F4/80 in other regions of the brain, we provide further support for the anatomic specificity of the phenomenon (Howard et al., 2004; De Souza et al., 2005; Enriori et al., 2007).To evaluate whether fatty acids, acting directly in the hypothalamus, can reproduce the effect of HF diet, rats were intracerebroventricularly treated with different mixtures of fatty acids, and the expression of cytokines was determined. The compositions of the mixtures were chosen based on the expected compositions of vegetable oils and animal fat, particularly soybean oil (Fedeli and Jacini, 1971) and pork lard (Brooks, 1971), respectively. Oleic acid, used as a control, induced only the expression of IL-10 and IL-6, both known to possess anti-inflammatory actions, and therefore, reinforcing the alleged anti-inflammatory property of this fatty acid (Mart\u00ednez-Dominguez et al., 2001; Yoneyama et al., 2007). Conversely, both the vegetable and the saturated fatty acid mixtures provided consistent stimuli for the expression of inflammatory cytokines, however, with the greater effect induced by the saturated mixture. When pure saturated and unsaturated fatty acids were tested separately, there was a clear difference with greatest inflammatory effect produced by long-chain saturated fatty acids. Although some previous studies have evaluated the abilities of fatty acids to induce cytokine expression, this is the first time the phenomenon has been shown in the hypothalamus (de Pablo and Alvarez de Cienfuegos, 2000; Pomp\u00e9ia et al., 2000).Arachidic acid is a 20-carbon saturated fatty acid present in triacylglycerols from animal fat and some vegetable oils (Hlongwane et al., 2001). We decided to employ this fatty acid in the remainder of the experiments because it produced the highest stimulus for TNF-\u03b1 expression in the hypothalamus and because some previous reports have shown its property to be transported across the blood\u2013brain barrier (Strosznajder et al., 1996). When intracerebroventricularly injected in the hypothalamus, arachidic acid rapidly induced the activation of ER stress and TLR2 and TLR4 signaling. These were specific events, because no effect was seen with the intracerebroventricular injection of the diluent BSA, and complete inhibition was achieved using specific inhibitors for each pathway tested. Interestingly, in the experiments performed to evaluate TLR activation, the bands obtained when immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-TLRs and blotting with anti-MyD88 antibodies, were different in density compared with bands produced by anti-MyD88 immunoprecipitation and anti-TLRs blotting. Although we have no current explanation for this fact, we suspect that it can be attributable to differences in stoichiometric ratio between the receptors and the adaptor protein, because other adaptor proteins can bind to these receptors (Tanimura et al., 2008).In previous studies, when TLR signaling and ER stress were evaluated in the context of diet- and genetic-induced obesity, insulin resistance was produced by the activation of intracellular inflammatory signaling through JNK and/or IKK, and further enhanced by the induction of proinflammatory cytokine expression (Ozcan et al., 2004, 2006; Shi et al., 2006; Tsukumo et al., 2007). However, the possible interaction between both mechanisms was never tested. Here, to explore the hypothesis that TLR signaling and ER stress can interact, at the intracellular level, and to evaluate the possibility that one of these mechanisms could in fact lead to or potentiate the other, we performed specific inhibitions of TLR2, TLR4, and ER stress and evaluated the capacity of arachidic acid to induce activation of each one. Our results show that the inhibition of one of the TLRs does not interfere with the activation of the other. However, only the inhibition of TLR4 completely blunts arachidic acid-induced ER stress, suggesting that TLR4 activation precedes and determines ER stress induction. This was further confirmed by studding isolated macrophages from TLR loss-of-function mutation mice. Conversely, the inhibition of ER stress fails to modulate TLR signaling. In addition, when comparing the activation of both TLRs, it is clear that arachidic acid produces a much stronger signal for the activation of TLR4 than TLR2, which is consistent with the fact that TLR2/1 and TLR2/6 dimmers recognize preferentially diacyl and triacyl lipopeptides, respectively, whereas TLR4 recognizes fatty acids contained in LPS and also free fatty acids (Shimazu et al., 1999; Takeuchi et al., 2001; Akira, 2003; Akira et al., 2006). Finally, the  inhibition of TLR4 or the genetic disarrangement of this receptor, as it occurs in the TLR4 loss-of-function mutant, completely inhibits arachidic acid induction of cytokine expression, whereas PBA treatment only partially modulates this response. Thus, at the cellular level, the long-chain saturated fatty acid acts predominantly through TLR4, leading to an inflammatory response that can be potentiated by the activation of ER stress, which is also dependent on TLR4 engagement.The specificity of the response to saturated fatty acids was further investigated by feeding rats isocaloric hyperlipidic diets rich in saturated or unsaturated fat. Although food intake and body mass gain is the same, independently of the diet composition, the anorexigenic response to leptin is preserved in OL rats while completely blunted in HF rats. In addition, the replacement of hyperlipidic diets by normolipidic diet shows that previous consumption of HF diet acts as an imprint that predisposes to continuous high rate body mass gain while a significant decrease in the rate of body mass gain occurs in previously OL fed rats. Thus, the induction of resistance to anorexigenic signaling depends more on diet composition than on caloric value.In the last part of the study, we show that a functional TLR4 signaling is required for the induction of dietary obesity. Initially, we show that most TLR4 present in the hypothalamus of rats fed on HF diet is expressed in microglia, placing the innate immune system in the center of this process. TLR4 loss-of-function mutation does not affect food intake but protects mice from obesity induced by hypercaloric-hyperlipidic diet, whereas TLR4, but not ER stress pharmacological inhibition, preserves the anorexigenic response to leptin and inhibits diet-induced obesity. In a previous study, some of these questions were addressed, and the protection from diet-induced obesity in C3H/HeJ was mostly related to energy expenditure than to control of feeding, which seem to be the case here, because no change in food intake was seen (Tsukumo et al., 2007). In addition, inhibition of ER stress by chemical means promoted no change of body mass in ob/ob mice (Ozcan et al., 2006).In conclusion, saturated fatty acids activate TLR2 and TLR4 signaling and ER stress in hypothalamus. The greatest signal is delivered through TLR4, which determines ER stress induction (Fig. 10). The presence of a functional TLR4 signaling is required for the development of hyperlipidic dietary obesity. Thus, in addition to its important role in the development of diet- and obesity-related insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus, TLR4 is an important mediator of hypothalamic dysfunction during the development of obesity. As hypothalamic resistance to anorexigenic signaling is a very incipient phenomenon during the installation of obesity (Prada et al., 2005), TLR4 is an attractive target for therapeutics of this epidemic condition.Proposed mechanism for saturated fatty acid (SFA)-induced activation of inflammatory response in hypothalamus. Initially, SFA activates predominantly TLR4, engaging MyD88. The classical downstream signaling through IRAK/TRAF6/NFkB (not tested in the present study) leads to cytokine expression. Through a hitherto unknown mechanism, TLR4 activation induces ER stress, which boosts cytokine expression enhancing the inhibitory signals of anorexigenic hormone action.This work was supported by grants from Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico.

Here, we show that stimulatory or tolerogenic functional states of intracerebral DCs regulate the systemic activation of neuroantigen-specific T cells, the recruitment of these cells into the CNS and the onset and progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Intracerebral microinjection of stimulatory DCs exacerbated the onset and clinical course of EAE, accompanied with an early T-cell infiltration and a decreased proportion of regulatory FoxP3-expressing cells in the brain. In contrast, the intracerebral microinjection of DCs modified by tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 induced their tolerogenic functional state and delayed or prevented EAE onset. This triggered the generation of interleukin 10 (IL-10)-producing neuroantigen-specific lymphocytes in the periphery and restricted IL-17 production in the CNS. Our findings suggest that DCs are a rate-limiting factor for neuroinflammation.Since the first discovery of dendritic cells (DCs) in the CNS (Matyszak and Perry, 1996), these cells have emerged as pivotal players in the development and maintenance of CNS autoimmunity and inflammation (for review, see Becher et al., 2006; McMahon et al., 2006). DCs are rarely detected in the healthy CNS, and when they are present, they localize to vascular-rich tissues including the meninges and choroid plexus (Matyszak and Perry, 1996; Hanly and Petito, 1998; McMenamin, 1999; Serot et al., 2000; Greenwood et al., 2003). Several studies have demonstrated a substantial accumulation of DCs in the brain and spinal cord in response to local inflammation induced by autoimmunity, infection, or trauma (Hanly and Petito, 1998; McMenamin, 1999; Suter et al., 2003; McMahon et al., 2005; Newman et al., 2005; Bailey et al., 2007). The mechanism(s) by which DCs accumulate in the CNS under inflammatory conditions are not well understood.The concordance of (1) accumulation of DCs in the CSF during progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS) (Fischer and Bielinsky, 1999; Aloisi et al., 2000; Fischer et al., 2000; Fischer and Reichmann, 2001; Juedes and Ruddle, 2001; Kivis\u00e4kk et al., 2004), (2) the localization of DCs at the proximity of inflamed microvessels in MS lesions (Serafini et al., 2006), and (3) the production of astrocyte-derived chemokines that promote recruitment of DCs into the CNS (Ambrosini et al., 2005) strongly suggest that brain microvessel endothelial cells regulate the recruitment of DCs into the CNS. We have previously demonstrated that the transmigration of DCs across brain microvessel endothelium is regulated by macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b1 (MIP-1\u03b1), matrix metalloproteinases, and occludin perturbation. In addition, transmigration of DCs across brain microvessel endothelial cell monolayers contributed to the activation of antigen-specific T cells  (Zozulya et al., 2007).Conflicting data exist concerning the contribution of DCs to the outcome of CNS inflammation. It was proposed that DCs inhibit T-cell responses in the CNS (Suter et al., 2003), thus leading to protection from EAE (Kleindienst et al., 2005). However, other data suggests that DCs contribute to the induction and maintenance of neuroinflammation in EAE (Dittel et al., 1999; Weir et al., 2002). For example, increasing the number of DCs in the brain by systemic injection of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt-3L) leads to a substantial increase in the severity of clinical EAE symptoms (Greter et al., 2005). Conversely, inhibition of Flt-3L signaling ameliorates EAE, providing further evidence that DC numbers in the brain correlate with the outcome of autoimmune responses (Whartenby et al., 2005). In addition, CNS-resident F4/80\u2212CD11c+CD45high cells isolated from brains of animals experiencing relapsing EAE or Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelinating disease can efficiently present endogenous myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) antigen and activate naive PLP139\u2013151-specific T cells  (McMahon et al., 2005). Further supporting a stimulatory role for DCs in regulating CNS immune responses, DCs were recently shown to be the only CNS antigen-presenting cells (APC) population capable of inducing memory cytotoxic T-cell responses in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection (Lauterbach et al., 2006).Taking advantage of methods used to generate stimulatory or inhibitory tolerogenic DCs that can be injected intracerebrally, we addressed the role of functionally different DCs on the generation of neuroantigen-specific T-cell responses and clinical outcome of EAE. Our data demonstrate that the quantity and functional phenotypes of DCs in the brain regulate the onset and progression of EAE.Four- to six-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. 2D2 transgenic (Tg) mice were a gift from Dr. V. Kuchroo (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) (Bettelli et al., 2003). \u201cDepletion of regulatory T-cell\u201d (DEREG)-transgenic mice were a gift from Dr. T. Sparwasser (University of Muenchen, Munich, Germany) (Lahl et al., 2007). Experimental animals were housed in a pathogen-free facility at the University of Wisconsin, Medical School Animal Care Unit under guidelines of the National Institutes of Health or at the University of Wuerzburg Animal care facility according to German guidelines for animal care. Protocols for animal use were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison and University of Wuerzburg (Regierung von Unterfranken).For intracerebral injection, the mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a ketamine (90 mg/kg)\u2013xylazine (10 mg/kg) mixture. Dendritic cells (2.5 \u00d7 105) loaded or unloaded with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide 35\u201355 (MOG35\u201355) (10 \u03bcg/ml CyberSyn) in 20 \u03bcl of PBS, or an equal volume of PBS was injected into the right frontal lobe with an insulin syringe attached to a penetrating depth controller as described previously (Ling et al., 2003, 2006). The injection was restricted to the ventral-posterior region of the frontal lobe, and the penetrating depth of the syringe was 1.55 mm from the surface of the brain. For each intracerebral injection, the solution was injected slowly, and then the syringe was held in place for an additional minute to reduce backfilling of injected solution.In some experiments, 5 \u00d7 106 2D2 transgenic T cells were adoptively transferred into mice (Sewell et al., 2003). Where indicated, DCs were incubated in the presence of 200 ng/ml pertussis toxin (PTX) (List Biological Laboratories) during antigen pulsing (Marriott et al., 1999). PTX-treated DCs were extensively washed before injection. No significant effect of PTX on DC phenotype, maturation and function was observed  (Karman et al., 2004a) (data not shown).For EAE induction, emulsion of equal volumes of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) (5 mg/ml) and 200 \u03bcg MOG35\u201355 supplemented with  (Strain H37Ra; Difco) were injected subcutaneously in the scapular region of each mouse. PTX (400 ng/mouse) was intraperitoneally injected on the days 0 and 2 relative to immunization. Clinical scores were monitored daily in a blind manner and recorded as follows: 0, no clinical disease; 1, flaccid tail; 2, gait disturbance or hind limb weakness; 3, hind limb paralysis and no weight bearing on hind limbs; 4, hind limb and forelimb paralysis and reduced ability to move around the cage; and 5, moribund or dead. The mean daily clinical score and SEM were calculated for each group. The significance of differences was calculated by Student's  and Wilcox tests as described by Fleming et al. (2005).DCs were generated as described previously (Inaba et al., 1992; Karman et al., 2004a). Briefly, bone marrow obtained from femurs and tibias of C57BL/6 mice was washed and plated in 24-well plates in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin and 20 ng/ml granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). GM-CSF was titrated from supernatants of the GM-CSF-secreting X63 cell line (a gift from Dr. A. Erdei, Eotvos University, Budapest, Hungary). Seven days after GM-CSF cultures, the nonadherent and loosely adherent cells were removed and replated in the absence of GM-CSF and cultured together for 4 h with or without MOG35\u201355 peptide (10 \u03bcg/ml). Nonadherent cells were collected for use as described previously (Karman et al., 2004a). To generate semimatured or fully matured DCs, cells were treated for 4 h with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 (500 U/ml; PeproTech) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (10 \u03bcg/ml), with or without MOG35\u201355 as described by Menges et al. (2002).Spleen and lymph nodes were dissected, weighed, and transferred into cold HBSS (Cellgro). The isolated lymphocytes were washed with cold HBSS and resuspended either in staining buffer (PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% NaN3) for a direct cell-surface staining, or in culture medium (RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS) for an overnight cell culture followed by intracellular cytokine staining. For spleens, red blood cells were lysed with Tris-NH4Cl. Minced brain tissue was processed with Medicon inserts (BD Biosciences). Brain lymphocytes were isolated from the interface of a Percoll density gradient as described previously (Sewell et al., 2004). For some samples, the total number of isolated cells per gram of tissue was calculated.Single-cell suspensions were stained with saturating concentrations of antibodies at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. Monoclonal antibodies used for cell surface staining were purchased from BD Biosciences and included anti-CD8, anti-CD4, anti-v\u03b211, anti-LFA-1, anti-CD45, anti-CD11b, and anti-FoxP3. Nonspecific binding to cell surface Fc receptors was blocked with unlabeled Fc\u03b3RII/Fc\u03b3RIII-specific antibody (clone 2.4G2) as described previously (Karman et al., 2004a). For intracellular staining of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, single-cell suspensions from spleen (106 cells/ml) or brain lymphocyte preparation (105 cells/ml) were cultured for 12 h in 96-well plates in RPMI-10% FBS with or without MOG35\u201355 (10 \u03bcg/ml) in the presence of GolgiStop (1 \u03bcl/ml) (BD Biosciences) before being stained for extracellular ligands and intracellular cytokines. In some experiments, the supernatants of restimulated cells were assessed by cytokine bead array for measurement of IFN-\u03b3, interleukin 17 (IL-17), and IL-10 according to the manufacturer's instruction (Bender MedSystems). Stained cells were acquired on a four-color FACSCalibur cytometer and were analyzed with FlowJo software (TreeStar) version 7.2.1.Single-cell suspensions from the spleen of a 2D2 mouse were incubated with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) (2.5 \u03bcm; Invitrogen) in HBSS for 5 min at 37\u00b0C. The reaction was quenched with 20% FBS. Cells were processed for adoptive transfer into C57BL/6 mice (5 \u00d7 106 cells in 100 \u03bcl of PBS per mouse).Differences between groups were determined with unpaired Mann\u2013Whitney and Wilcox tests.  values <0.05 were considered to be significant.The accumulation of activated neuroantigen-specific T cells in the nervous tissue is a hallmark of autoimmune diseases of the CNS. Although the brain parenchyma is usually devoid of DCs, several recent studies have demonstrated that these cells are prominent components of CNS infiltrates in EAE and MS (Fischer and Reichmann, 2001; Suter et al., 2003; Greter et al., 2005; Bailey et al., 2007; Deshpande et al., 2007). To determine whether increasing the number of stimulatory DCs in the brain induces antigen-specific immune responses in the periphery, we injected MOG35\u201355 peptide-presenting DCs intracerebrally (intracerebral DCMOG) into C57BL/6 mice and subsequently analyzed the proliferation of MOG-specific (2D2) T cells in different organs 5 d after their adoptive transfer. We have previously shown that intracerebral microinjection of either ovalbumin (OVA) (Ling et al., 2006) or OVA-loaded DCs (Karman et al., 2004a) initiated antigen-specific T-cell responses in the cervical lymph nodes (CLN), spleen and the homing of OVA-specific T cells into the brain (Karman et al., 2004a). To extend these studies, we addressed whether the spatial localization of DCs in the brain is important for inducing neuroantigen-specific T-cell responses in the brain and CLNs. CFSE-labeled CD4+ T cells from 2D2 mice, expressing a Tg T-cell receptor specific for MOG35\u201355 peptide and defined by V\u03b13.2 and V\u03b211+ subunit chains (Bettelli et al., 2003), were adoptively transferred into three groups of C57BL/6 animals (Fig. 1, top). These groups included intracerebrally injected PBS and DCMOG mice and intravenously injected DCMOG mice (Fig. 1, left, middle, and right of bottom panel, respectively). Five days after immunization, we analyzed the accumulation and activation of CFSE-labeled 2D2 Tg CD4+ T cells in the brain, CLNs and spleen. Our data show that intracerebral but not systemic injection of DCs resulted in antigen-specific T-cell accumulation in the brain. Based on high expression of LFA-1, antigen-specific CFSE-labeled T cells in the brain were highly activated (Fig. 1, top center of bottom panel). As expected, MOG-specific T cells were stimulated in the CLN and spleen, where they underwent several cycles of proliferation before their accumulation in the brain (Fig. 1, bottom of bottom panel, arrows). Only intracerebral injection of DCMOG induced the proliferation of MOG-specific T cells in the CLN and spleen and the accumulation of neuroantigen-specific T cells in the CNS. In contrast, intravenous injection of DCMOG resulted in 2D2 T-cell proliferation in the spleen but not in the CLN, and no accumulation of cells was found in the brain (Fig. 1, most right column of bottom panel). As a control for injection-induced microtrauma, we injected the same volume of sterile PBS intracerebrally. Importantly, PBS injection alone did not induce proliferation of antigen-specific T cells in the periphery or the accumulation of these cells in the brain (Fig. 1, far left plots). No MOG-specific T-cell accumulation in the CNS was observed after intracerebral injection of DCs pulsed with ovalbumin (intracerebral DCOVA) or other MHCII (major histocompatibility complex II)-restricted peptides (e.g., pigeon cytochrome , PCC) (data not shown). Because we previously demonstrated that only the relevant antigen-expressing DCs induce antigen-specific T-cell accumulation in the CNS (Karman et al., 2004a, 2006), irrelevant peptides, such as OVA-expressing DCs, were not included in further studies. Analysis of the absolute number of tissue infiltrating CD4+V\u03b211+LFA-1highCFSElow cells further confirmed that activated antigen-specific CD4+ T cells were accumulating in the brain when intracerebrally injected antigen-presenting DCs were present (Fig. 1,).Intracerebral but not systemic DCMOG injection results in MOG-specific 2D2 T-cell expansion in the periphery and the accumulation of these cells in the brain. , Intracerebral PBS, intracerebral DCMOG, or intracerebral DCMOG injections were followed by an adoptive transfer of 5 \u00d7 106 CFSE-labeled 2D2 Tg T cells into C57BL/6 mice to track the migration of V\u03b211+CD4+ T cells.

Each symbol represents a single mouse; small horizontal bars indicate the mean. *** < 0.0001 (ANOVA).It was shown previously that MOG-specific FoxP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells accumulate in the CNS during EAE (Korn et al., 2007; O'Connor et al., 2007). To determine whether intracerebral DCs could also induce the accumulation of antigen-specific Treg cells in the brain, we intracerebrally injected 2D2 Tg mice with MOG-pulsed DCs and tracked the appearance of both MOG-specific and nonspecific Treg cells in the CNS and peripheral tissues (Fig. 2, top). We also confirmed our previous results showing that intracerebral DCMOG injection induces V\u03b211+CD4+ MOG-specific T-cell accumulation in the brain (Fig. 2, top right panel of bottom panel). Intracerebral DCMOG injection resulted in approximately five times higher infiltration of MOG-specific V\u03b211+CD4+ T cells in the brain compared with the intracerebral PBS injections (Fig. 2, top left). Unpulsed DCs were used as a control to test whether the observed effects depended on the accessibility of MOG antigen to DCs. Interestingly, we detected two times higher infiltration of MOG-specific V\u03b211+CD4+ T cells in the brain after the injection of unpulsed DCs compared with intracerebral PBS injections, but this was clearly less compared with intracerebral DCMOG injection (Fig. 2, top center). This may indicate that DCs can uptake neuroantigens in the brain and induce the accumulation of antigen-specific T cells in the CNS. Regardless of the antigen, intracerebral DCs induced the presence of FoxP3-expressing CD4+ T cells with the prevalence of MOG-specific V\u03b211+FoxP3+ Treg cells. Although \u223c2% of MOG-specific Treg cells were found in the CLN in all groups of animals (Fig. 2, middle), no MOG-specific Treg cells were detected in the spleen after intracerebral injections (Fig. 2, bottom). These experiments demonstrate that intracerebral DCs elicit the accumulation of both encephalitogenic and regulatory T cells in the CNS. Altogether, these data suggest that antigen-carrying DCs in the brain contribute to the neuroantigen-specific T-cell accumulation in the CNS.Intracerebral injection of DCMOG induces V\u03b211+CD4+ MOG-specific T-cell accumulation in the brain with the prevalence of MOG over non-MOG-specific V\u03b211+FoxP3+ Treg cells. 2D2/Bl6 mice were intracerebrally injected with PBS, unpulsed DCs, or DCs loaded with MOG (DCMOG). Five days after immunization, CNS, CLN, and spleen cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Plots are gated for CD4+V\u03b211+ (MOG-specific) and CD4+V\u03b211\u2212 (non-MOG-specific) T cells (left) and analyzed for FoxP3 expression (right). Numbers in quadrants indicate the percentage of cells in each gate. Data plotted as dot plots of CD4+V\u03b211+, CD4+V\u03b211\u2212 and as contour plots of FoxP3 distribution in different organs in response to intracerebral injections. Data are from two experiments with three mice per group.When we used transgenic mice termed DEREG mice (Lahl et al., 2007), in which FoxP3+ cells can easily be detected and followed for tissue distribution based on GFP expression regardless of their antigen specificity, we did not observe any differences in the fraction of GFP+CD4+FoxP3-expressing Treg cells in response to different types of DCs or PBS injections in the periphery (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). However, higher percentages of CNS-derived GFP+ cells were detectable in intracerebrally injected animals with no differences between intracerebrally injected PBS and DCMOG groups compared with intravenous DCMOG. This suggests that microtrauma induced by intracerebral injection of PBS or DCs was not sufficient to induce the accumulation of antigen-specific T cells in the brain but attracts Treg cells that can be found in the brain 5 d after injection (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).In Figure 1, we demonstrated that intracerebrally injected DCs that carry MOG antigen contribute to the activation of MOG-specific T cells in the periphery and the accumulation of these cells in the CNS. From our previous studies, we also learned that in addition to presenting antigen in the CNS, DCs can deliver antigens from inflamed CNS and induce homing of peripheral antigen-specific T cells into nervous tissue (Karman et al., 2004b; Ling et al., 2006). To further understand the  significance of these results, we extended our work to analyze whether intracerebrally injected DCs loaded with MOG peptide would influence the clinical course or onset of EAE. In these experiments, we also used DCs that were pulsed with MHC class II-specific OVA peptide (DCOVA) in parallel with DCMOG. Thus, DCMOG, DCOVA, or equal volume of sterile PBS was intracerebrally injected into the CNS, and 5 d later, EAE was actively induced by immunization with MOG35\u201355 antigen (Fig. 3, top). Mice intracerebrally injected with DCMOG experienced a significantly accelerated EAE onset and a more progressive course of the disease compared with intracerebrally injected PBS and DCOVA animals (Fig. 3, bottom; Table 1). Accordingly, the frequency of CD4+LFA-1+ double-positive IFN-\u03b3-producing cells in the brain of intracerebrally injected DCOVA mice (3.6%) was significantly lower at 7 d after EAE induction compared with intracerebrally injected DCMOG (16.7%) mice (Fig. 3). Also, a higher percentage of activated LFA-1+CD4+ T cells was observed in intracerebrally injected DCMOG mice (\u223c80%) compared with intracerebrally injected DCOVA (37%) and PBS (23.5%) mice. Still, modest acceleration of EAE clinical scores (Fig. 3) and cellular infiltration (Fig. 3) was observed in response to intracerebrally DCOVA injections. This might suggest that OVA-pulsed and intracerebrally injected DCs could amplify neuroinflammation by contributing to CNS antigen-specific T-cell activation. In support of this, myeloid DCs were recently described as a superior CNS cell population in EAE mice, capable of inducing naive CD4+ T-cell proliferation and cytokine production with endogenous peptides (Bailey et al., 2007) (for review, see Miller et al., 2007b).Intracerebral DCMOG injection induces an earlier onset of EAE, altering the severity and duration of the disease.

These mice did not develop clinical signs of EAE, indicating that subcutaneously injected MOG antigen is still required for full susceptibility to clinical disease (Table 1).Graphical representation of EAE day onset for intracerebrally DCMOG-immunized animals compared with intracerebrally injected DCOVA and PBS mice confirms an earlier onset of disease (Fig. 3). Likewise, graphical representation of the disease severity in number of days with EAE clinical scores \u22652.5 from all animals involved in EAE experiments (Table 1) shows a higher number of mice with EAE score of 2.5 or above in intracerebrally injected DCMOG groups compared with intracerebrally injected PBS and DCOVA groups (Fig. 3). A significantly increased disease severity was also observed between intracerebrally injected PBS and DCOVA animals, proving DC contribution to CNS-triggered neuroinflammation (Fig. 3). Immunohistopathology was performed in addition to clinical EAE scoring, and cellular infiltration was analyzed in the animal cohorts described above. On day 17 after EAE induction, immunohistopathology directly correlated with the EAE development in all experimental groups and was followed by a higher cellular infiltration and demyelination degree at lesion sites in the optic nerves (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), brain and spinal cord tissues (not shown) in intracerebrally injected DCMOG and DCOVA animals compared with intracerebrally injected PBS animals. These data show that injected DCs contribute to cellular infiltration and demyelination in the CNS.The intracerebral DCOVA group in the last set of experiments has helped us conclude that antigen-specific T cells do not accumulate in the CNS in the absence of their specific antigen and neuroinflammation, and that intracerebral injections of PBS or DCs (pulsed or not pulsed with antigen) induces the same level of microtrauma in the brain that does not result in the accumulation of antigen-specific cells in this tissue.We next wanted to determine whether the accumulation of T cells in the brain after intracerebral DCMOG injection and EAE induction correlates with clinical disease (Fig. 4, experimental scheme). Our data show that intracerebral DCMOG injection resulted in earlier accumulation of CD4+ and also CD8+ T cells in the brain (preclinical phase) (Fig. 4). At day 14 after EAE induction (peak of disease), differences in T-cell accumulation between intracerebral PBS and intracerebral DCMOG were not statistically significant (Fig. 4). These data indicate that increasing the number of MOG-presenting DCs in the CNS induces early immune responses in the periphery, and the accelerated accumulation of T cells in the brain contributes to the amplification of neuroinflammation during early stages of the EAE clinical course.Intracerebral DCMOG injection results in increased infiltration of T cells into the CNS before EAE onset. Intracerebral DCMOG or intracerebrally injected PBS mice were induced with EAE 5 d after injection and used for T-cell analysis before EAE onset (day 7 after EAE induction) and at the peak of the disease (day 14 after EAE induction). , , The dot plots represent the percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ CNS infiltrating T cells (top) and absolute cell number per gram of CNS tissue (bottom) 7 d () and 14 d () after EAE immunization. Dot plots presented are representative analyses of unpooled samples from five separate experiments, each with three to four mice per group. [Two-tailed Student's  test,  = 0.01 for CD4+ T cells (gray bars) and  = 0.05 for CD8+ T cells (white bars).]To address the question whether the migration of intracerebrally injected DCs out of the brain would be required to influence EAE disease onset, we inhibited the migratory capacity of DCs with PTX, blocking chemokine receptor signaling . After  treatment, PTX pretreated DCs were injected into the brain. In Figure 5, we show that pretreatment of DCMOG before their intracerebral injection does not exacerbate the onset of EAE (no significant differences between intracerebral PBS vs intracerebral DCMOG(PTX)) (Fig. 5,). The intracerebral DCMOG injection led to a significantly accelerated EAE clinical onset compared with both intracerebral PBS and intracerebral DCMOG(PTX) groups (Fig. 5,). Furthermore, the disease severity was significantly enhanced if intracerebral PBS and intracerebral DCMOG groups were compared; however, we did not find statistical differences between intracerebral DCMOG and intracerebral DCMOG(PTX) groups (Fig. 5).Pretreatment of DCMOG cells with PTX before their intracerebral injection does not exacerbate the onset of EAE. , Mice were injected intracerebrally with PBS, DCMOG, or DCMOG pretreated with PTX 5 d before EAE induction.

(Student's  test, ** = 0.006.)To further define the mechanisms by which intracerebral DCs regulate the early development and severity of clinical EAE symptoms, we studied the kinetics and frequency of IFN-\u03b3-producing, MOG-specific peripheral T cells. Intracerebral delivery of DCMOG induced significantly higher numbers of IFN-\u03b3-secreting, MOG-reactive CD4+ T cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs (spleen) (Fig. 6) (lymph nodes) (not shown). These cells were detected earlier in the course of EAE compared with intracerebrally injected PBS animals (as measured at day 7 after EAE induction) (Fig. 6) and also remained significantly higher at the peak of EAE (day 14) (Fig. 6). We also detected the frequency of IL-17-producing CD4+ T cells in the peripheral immune organs, which appeared to be slightly elevated in the intracerebral DCMOG compared with the intracerebral PBS group at earlier time points of EAE (day 7) (Fig. 6) and significantly higher at later time points (day 14) (Fig. 6). Interestingly, IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4+ T cells from cultured splenocytes isolated at different time points after EAE induction (day 7 and day 14) could also be detected in media without MOG restimulation from intracerebral DCMOG, but not from intracerebrally injected PBS animals. In the clinical phase of EAE (day 14), double positive IFN-\u03b3+IL-17+ CD4+ T cells could also be detected in intracerebral DCMOG but not in intracerebral PBS group (Fig. 6).Exacerbation of EAE during intracerebral DCMOG injection is associated with increased numbers of MOG-specific IFN-\u03b3- and IL-17-producing CD4+ T cells in the peripheral immune organs. , , Dot plots demonstrate IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17-producing CD4+ T cells in media or after MOG35\u201355 peptide restimulation 7 () and 14 d () after EAE induction. Data shown are representative of seven independent experiments, each with three to four mice per group with similar outcome.Growing evidence indicates a bidirectional interaction between Treg cells and DCs (Tang and Bluestone, 2006; Tang et al., 2006). We therefore speculated that the impact of intracerebral DC modulation on CNS autoinflammation might be reflected in a change in the absolute numbers or in the ratio between encephalitogenic and regulatory CD4+ T cells in the CNS. Lymphocytes isolated from noninflamed (naive) brains contained only a few CD4+ T cells that predominantly exhibited the FoxP3high regulatory phenotype (Fig. 7). The expression of FoxP3 on CD4+CD25high cells was clearly decreased in the brain of intracerebrally injected DCMOG animals (Fig. 7, bottom) compared with intracerebrally injected PBS control group (Fig. 6, top). This data show that in parallel with early EAE onset and higher accumulation of MOG-specific T cells after intracerebral DCMOG injection, the frequency of FoxP3high cells in the brain is decreased, and intracerebral DCMOG alters the ratio between encephalitogenic and regulatory T cells.Intracerebral DCMOG injection before EAE induction results in increased numbers of CD4+ T cells in the CNS, downregulating the number of regulatory T cells at the expense of effector cells. , , The dot plots represent the percentage of CD4+CD25high T cells (left) and the percentage of FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (right) within CD25high population gated on CNS lymphocytes isolated from naive () and intracerebrally injected animals ( and experimental scheme). Data presented are representative analyses of three separate experiments, each with two mice per group.It has been proposed that CNS DCs have a dual role during EAE, as they could provide stimulatory or suppressive signals at different stages of disease (Deshpande et al., 2007). Modifying DC phenotypes with TNF-\u03b1 elicits the generation of IL-10-producing T cells and leads to antigen-specific prevention of EAE (Menges et al., 2002) (for review, see Steinman et al., 2003). We therefore asked the question whether the functional state of intracerebral DCs is decisive for the qualitative and quantitative outcome of experimental CNS inflammation. We injected MOG-pulsed and TNF-\u03b1- or LPS-treated (DCTNF-\u03b1 or DCLPS) semimature DCs intracerebrally and subsequently induced EAE. Among other microbial products, LPS treatment results in an upregulation of maturation markers and an increase in the ability of DCs to stimulate T cells (for review, see Reis e Sousa, 2006). Intracerebrally injected DCLPS significantly exacerbated EAE onset and increased EAE severity compared with intracerebrally injected PBS animals (Fig. 8; Table 2). Intracerebral injection of DCTNF-\u03b1 beneficially modulated EAE compared with the intracerebrally injected DCLPS group. Protection ranged from delaying disease onset to full prevention of clinical symptoms (only 35% disease incidence) (Fig. 8; Table 2). Onset of EAE clinical symptoms was on average 3\u20134 d later in intracerebrally injected DCTNF-\u03b1 and PBS mice compared with intracerebrally injected DCLPS animals. Also, the severity of disease after onset was lower in intracerebrally injected DCTNF-\u03b1 groups compared with intracerebrally injected DCLPS groups. To assess the mechanism of how intracerebral DCTNF-\u03b1 injections promoted EAE protection, we measured the frequency and function of peripheral and CNS-infiltrating immune cells in intracerebrally injected DCTNF-\u03b1, DCLPS, and PBS mice. Although clinical disease was delayed or EAE was ameliorated (Fig. 8; Table 2), intracerebrally injected DCTNF-\u03b1 EAE mice did not have decreased numbers of CNS infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at any time points (Fig. 9,). The ratio of encephalitogenic to regulatory T cells was higher in intracerebrally injected DCLPS and DCTNF-\u03b1 groups compared with intracerebrally injected PBS mice, similar to that observed between intracerebrally injected DCMOG and PBS groups (Fig. 7) (data not shown). We observed a higher accumulation of CD45+CD11bhigh macrophages in intracerebrally injected DCLPS mice and similar subsets of CD45+CD11bhigh macrophages and CD45+CD11blow microglia in intracerebrally injected PBS and DCTNF-\u03b1 groups (Fig. 9). Similar to intracerebrally injected DCMOG animals (Fig. 4), CD4+ T cells persisted at later stages of EAE (day 17) in intracerebrally injected DCTNF-\u03b1 and DCLPS groups compared with intracerebral PBS controls (Fig. 9). To find factors that may be responsible for earlier EAE onset (intracerebral DCLPS) or a delay in EAE onset (intracerebral DCTNF-\u03b1) at earlier time points of disease, we measured the cytokines produced both in the CNS and periphery at different stages of EAE. Notably, lymphocytes isolated from the CNS of intracerebrally injected DCTNF-\u03b1 and DCLPS mice produced comparable levels of IL-10 at earlier (day 7) and later (day 17) time points, which were higher compared with intracerebrally injected PBS animals (Fig. 9,, left panels). Although there was no IFN-\u03b3 signal detected in the CNS for intracerebrally injected PBS animals, 962 pg/ml of IFN-\u03b3 was detected in intracerebral DCLPS group, which was 10-fold higher than the concentration of IFN-\u03b3 in intracerebral DCTNF-\u03b1 mice (95 pg/ml) before EAE onset (day 7 after EAE induction). At this point, intracerebral DCTNF-\u03b1 completely protected both the CNS compartment and peripheral immune organs from IL-17-producing cells (26 pg/ml and 263 pg/ml, respectively) compared with the intracerebrally injected DCLPS group (1235 pg/ml and 10910 pg/ml, respectively) (Fig. 9). At later time points of EAE (day 17), the intracerebrally injected DCLPS group contained cells with a phenotype polarized toward Th-17 profile with 1350 pg/ml of IL-17 in the CNS and 7841 pg/ml of IL-17-producing cells in the periphery (spleen), which was twofold higher than IL-17 production detected in intracerebrally injected DCTNF-\u03b1 and PBS mice in the CNS and periphery (Fig. 9). However, a great majority of CNS lymphocytes in intracerebrally injected DCTNF-\u03b1 mice included IFN-\u03b3-producing cells (2468 pg/ml of IFN-\u03b3 in intracerebral DCTNF-\u03b1 compared with 962 pg/ml in intracerebral DCLPS mice), suggesting a Th1 phenotype in this group at later time points of EAE (day 17). At the same time, intracerebral DCTNF-\u03b1 injections induced a higher amount of peripheral IL-10 production after both 7 and 17 d after EAE induction compared with the intracerebral DCLPS group (Fig. 9,).Intracerebral injection of TNF-\u03b1 treated, semimature DCs (DCTNF-\u03b1) ameliorates EAE. DCs modified by TNF-\u03b1 (DCTNF-\u03b1) or LPS (DCLPS) were pulsed with MOG and intracerebrally injected into mice before EAE induction. The intracerebral PBS, intracerebral DCTNF-\u03b1, or intracerebral DCLPS injections were followed with active EAE induction 5 d after intracerebral injections. The mice were observed for EAE clinical scores over time. Graphical representation shows the proportion of mice in three groups on each day experiencing no onset or no clinical symptoms (gray portion of bar), mild EAE (black portion of bar), or severe EAE (red portion of bar).Effect of tolerogenic and stimulatory intracerebral immunizations of DC on EAE inductionMOG-loaded and intracerebrally injected DCLPS and DCTNF-\u03b1 induce similar infiltration of leukocytes into the brain but result in different cytokine profiles in the CNS and periphery. , , Intracerebrally injected PBS, DCLPS, or DCTNF-\u03b1 groups of injected mice were analyzed for leukocyte infiltration before EAE onset () and at the later phase of EAE ().

Data collected are from two separate experiments with CNS cells isolated from two to four mice and pooled.These data indicate that TNF-\u03b1-treated, MOG-pulsed DCs injection into the brain induces a predominantly IL-10 dominated peripheral immune response that restrains Th17-mediated pathology during EAE.DCs have emerged as pivotal regulators of CNS autoimmune and inflammatory responses. Taking advantage of the targeted intracerebral microinjection technology, combined with methods to generate stimulatory or inhibitory tolerogenic DCs, we have analyzed the role of functionally different DCs on the generation of neuroantigen-specific immune responses and their relevance for modulating experimental neuroinflammation using the mouse model of MOG35\u201355-induced EAE.Our results demonstrate that immunogenic DCs pulsed with MOG antigen and injected into the brain (intracerebral DCMOG) activated naive antigen-specific T cells in peripheral immune organs and promoted CNS invasion of neuroantigen-specific CD4+ T cells. However, the intracerebral DCMOG did not induce EAE if injected without active immunization. This implies that peripheral induction for the disease is necessary. In this model, a mixture of MOG and CFA needs to be delivered subcutaneously to induce EAE, and in this case, the intracerebral DCMOG accelerated EAE initiation. Together, this may suggest that peripheral antigen presentation and immunization are necessary and sufficient to induce EAE and that intracerebral DCMOG can only modify the kinetics of disease. Thus, the main role of DCs in the brain appears to be in the effector phase of the immune response, rather than in the priming phase. The increasing number of MOG-loaded stimulatory DCs in the brain also accelerated the onset of EAE disease and resulted in exacerbated clinical severity and the extent of the disease. This was accompanied by an early infiltration of IFN-\u03b3-producing MOG-reactive CD4+ T cells from the periphery into the CNS and a decrease in the proportion of FoxP3-expressing CD4+ regulatory T cells, suggesting a shift toward the enrichment of encephalitogenic T cells. In contrast, intracerebral injection of TNF-\u03b1-treated and MOG-loaded tolerogenic dendritic cells (intracerebral DCTNF-\u03b1) before EAE induction prevented clinical signs of EAE disease (35% disease incidence) or delayed EAE onset, followed by decreased IL-17 production in the CNS and increased level of IL-10-producing peripheral and CNS CD4+ T cells.Recently, several studies have contributed to the notion that antigen-presenting cells in the brain play a key role in determining the outcome of CNS inflammation (Greter et al., 2005; McMahon et al., 2005; Bailey et al., 2007). Under inflammatory conditions (e.g., autoimmunity and infectious disease), DCs accumulate in the CNS parenchyma, suggesting that CNS DCs are critical for the initiation, regulation, and/or maintenance of immune responses in the CNS. Although numerous studies unambiguously emphasize the potential relevance of DCs for CNS immune surveillance or autoimmune reactions, the true contribution of DCs in the initiation and perpetuation of neuroantigen-specific T-cell responses remains elusive. Our work tested the relevance and impact of CNS-derived DCs by taking advantage of a DC delivery method into the CNS. We found that the activation and CNS accumulation of neuroantigen-specific T cells critically depended on the route of MOG antigen delivery by DCs and the site of DC origin. Local brain DCs are likely to provide critical signals for attracting antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+T cells into the inflamed CNS (Carson et al., 1999; Tang and Cyster, 1999). A combination of different cytokines, chemokines and inflammatory mediators might be responsible for the regulation of local inflammatory responses via intracerebral DCs. At the same time, several chemokines such as MIP-1\u03b1 (CCL3), MIP-3\u03b2 (CCL20), MCP-1 (CCL2), and RANTES (CCL5) are produced in the CNS during acute and chronic EAE (Serafini et al., 2000; Bailey et al., 2007). Defined by chemokine responsiveness, DC populations can differentially migrate to CNS compartments (Bailey et al., 2007). Myeloid DCs were recently shown to preferentially accumulate in the perivascular inflammatory foci of the spinal cord and cerebellum, clustering there with T cells at the peak of EAE (Bailey et al., 2007). The establishment of such DC-T and DC-B cell clusters in the CNS may be necessary to sustain intrathecal clonal expansion of T cells and production of anti-myelin-specific antibodies as detected in EAE and MS lesions.Spatial CNS localization of MOG antigen-pulsed DCs is critical in the accumulation of antigen-specific T cells in the brain. To further strengthen the importance of specific antigen presentation by intracerebral DCs, we performed experiments directly in 2D2 mice. We show that intracerebral DCMOG injection significantly increased MOG-specific CD4+V\u03b211+ T-cell accumulation in the CNS (4.2 vs 21.15%). Unpulsed DC injection into the brain induced a detectable accumulation of neuroantigen-specific cells in the brain under these experimental conditions, which might be attributable to the intrinsic ability of intracerebral DCs to pick up local CNS antigen and present it to naive T cells, resulting in their expansion.Severity of EAE as well as the number of MS plaques seem to correlate with the presence and function of DCs (Pashenkov et al., 2001; Greter et al., 2005; Serafini et al., 2006). One of the most important observations from our studies is that the amount of DCs in the brain could be a limiting factor in CNS autoimmune diseases. Our data show that in the early phase of EAE autoimmune disease, the number of DCs in the brain is critical, and this is a rate-limiting factor for the development of the disease. This and other studies (Greter et al., 2005; McMahon et al., 2005) collectively suggest that CNS-associated DCs are capable of inducing pathogenetically relevant T-cell responses locally in the brain.Some data indicate that regulatory T cells are critical in the maintenance of immune privilege status of the CNS (Korn et al., 2007; O'Connor et al., 2007). We investigated the influence of intracerebral DCMOG injections on FoxP3 Treg accumulation in the CNS. Although the naive brain per se contained a very low number of CD4+ T cells, the majority of these cells expressed high levels of FoxP3. This might indicate that the high level of FoxP3 cells in the brain could be a part of the mechanisms maintaining an \u201cimmunological privileged\u201d milieu of the CNS. Our experiments show that intracerebral DC injections induce the CNS accumulation of FoxP3 negative neuroantigen-specific T cells, which occurs at the expense of FoxP3 Treg cells. Thus, immunogenic DCs clearly alter the ratio of encephalitogenic to regulatory T cells. Whether regulatory T cells play a critical role in modifying CNS autoimmunity needs to be further studied (Zozulya and Wiendl, 2008).DCs with regulatory or tolerogenic properties are capable of attenuating EAE (for review, see Miller et al., 2007a). It was previously demonstrated that DCMOG matured with TNF-\u03b1 and systemically injected into mice before EAE induction induced antigen-specific protection from EAE in mice (Menges et al., 2002). Here, we show that semimature DCs have a protective effect on subsequent CNS-directed autoimmune responses, emphasizing the notion that the functional state of DCs has a clear impact on the quantity and quality of CNS-directed immune responses. The mechanism of EAE-attenuation by tolerogenic TNF-\u03b1-matured DCs is noteworthy. Strikingly, absolute numbers of CNS-infiltrating immune cells are equally high in animals receiving intracerebral injections of DCTNF-\u03b1 or DCLPS. Although we did not test the production of cytokines by CNS DCs in this study, it is well known that multiple immune mediators can be produced by DCs. It was proposed that DCs can polarize CD4+ T cells to become either Th17 or Th1 cells, producing IL-17 or IFN-\u03b3, respectively. Tolerogenic or stimulatory DCs influence this polarization differently (Shortman and Liu, 2002; Shortman and Naik, 2007). Thus, IL-17 polarized CNS T cells with pathological function in the relapsing EAE model, and their clustering with myeloid DCs in the CNS indicate the latter as the only CNS APC population that biased antigen-specific T cells toward a Th17 profile (Bailey et al., 2007). Endogenously collecting CNS antigen and highly producing IL-6 and TGF-\u03b2, DCs polarized Th17 responses which could be an intrinsic property of myeloid DCs or the CNS environment (Bailey et al., 2007; Miller et al., 2007b). Our data show that intracerebral injection of DCTNF-\u03b1 completely protects the CNS from infiltration of IL-17-producing cells but promotes IL-10 cells both in the CNS and in the periphery at early time points of EAE. This supports the idea that CNS DCs, depending on their functional state, can accelerate IL-17 appearance, leading to earlier EAE onset or restrict IL-17 generation in the target organ, thus delaying the disease.In summary, our study shows that intracerebral DCs are capable of mounting CNS-specific T-cell responses and, in contrast to peripheral DCs, of inducing specific accumulation of neuroantigen-specific T cells in the brain. The quantity of stimulatory DCs in the CNS is a rate-limiting factor for the onset of subsequent EAE. Furthermore, the functional state of intracerebral DCs is decisive for the outcome of a subsequent autoimmune CNS inflammation: the presence of tolerogenic DCs in the brain protects from early development of EAE clinical signs by inducing IL-10 and restricting CNS-infiltrating IL-17 cells. Intracerebral DCs can therefore be considered as a crucial immune cell population during CNS-specific immune responses and can change the outcome of autoimmune inflammatory CNS disorders. This has clear implications for understanding the pathogenesis of MS and considering DCs as potential targets for future therapies.This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant RO1-NS 37570-01A2 (Z.F.), German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF, to H.W.), and German Research Foundation (SFB 581, TP A8, to H.W.).

Impairments in GABAergic inhibition to PFC pyramidal neurons have been implicated in the abnormal neural synchrony and working memory disturbances in schizophrenia. The dopamine D4 receptor, which is strongly linked to neuropsychiatric disorders, such as attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and schizophrenia, is highly expressed in PFC GABAergic interneurons, while the physiological role of D4 in these interneurons is largely unknown. In this study, we found that D4 activation caused a persistent suppression of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission in PFC interneurons. This effect of D4 receptors on AMPAR-EPSC was via a mechanism dependent on actin/myosin V motor-based transport of AMPA receptors, which was regulated by cofilin, a major actin depolymerizing factor. Moreover, we demonstrated that the major cofilin-specific phosphatase Slingshot, which was activated by calcineurin downstream of D4 signaling, was required for the D4 regulation of glutamatergic transmission. Thus, D4 receptors, by using the unique calcineurin/Slingshot/cofilin signaling mechanism, regulate actin dynamics and AMPAR trafficking in PFC GABAergic interneurons. It provides a potential mechanism for D4 receptors to control the excitatory synaptic strength in local-circuit neurons and GABAergic inhibition in the PFC network, which may underlie the role of D4 receptors in normal cognitive processes and mental disorders.The neocortical areas, including prefrontal cortex (PFC), are composed of two major neuronal populations: glutamatergic pyramidal neurons and GABAergic interneurons. It has been found that GABAergic inhibition plays a key role in the regulation of working memory, a major cognitive process subserved by PFC (Rao et al., 2000; Constantinidis et al., 2002). Selective alterations in GABAergic local-circuit neurons, GABA synthesis enzyme GAD67, GABA content, and GABAA receptors have been discovered in PFC of schizophrenic patients (Akbarian et al., 1995; Woo et al., 1998; Volk et al., 2000, 2002; Hashimoto et al., 2003), suggesting that impairments in GABAergic inhibition in the PFC network might contribute to the aberrant neuronal activity and disrupted working memory in schizophrenia (Lewis et al., 2005).Cortical GABAergic interneurons are heterogeneous, and they can be distinguished from pyramidal neurons by their distinct morphological features, circuit connections, electrophysiological characteristics, and protein expression patterns (Markram et al., 2004). For example, cortical GABAergic interneurons receive stronger and more frequent innervations from thalamus than pyramidal neurons; thus they are more strongly activated by excitatory inputs (Cruikshank et al., 2007). Moreover, the functional properties and subunit expression of AMPA receptors are distinct in cortical principal neurons and interneurons (Hestrin, 1993; Geiger et al., 1995). In principal neurons, AMPARs show relatively slow gating and low Ca2+ permeability, which is correlated with the abundant expression of both GluR1 and GluR2 subunits. In interneurons, AMPARs show faster gating and higher Ca2+ permeability, which is correlated with the lower expression of GluR2 subunits (Geiger et al., 1995). In addition, many calcium-binding proteins, such as parvalbumin, calbindin, and calretinin, are highly expressed in cortical GABAergic interneurons (Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1993, 1997). These proteins serve as calcium buffers, which effectively limit the spatial and temporal domains of calcium signaling. A functional consequence of the higher calcium buffering capacity in GABAergic interneurons may be the utilization of calcineurin, a protein phosphatase that can be catalytically activated by a low concentration of calcium.Functions of PFC neurons are strongly influenced by dopamine signaling through D1 and D2 receptors (Sawaguchi and Goldman-Rakic, 1991; Williams and Goldman-Rakic, 1995; Wang et al., 2004). Anatomic studies have found that D4 receptors are enriched in PFC GABAergic interneurons (Mrzljak et al., 1996), while the physiological role of D4 receptors in these interneurons is largely unknown. The D4 receptor has been implicated in schizophrenia because of its high affinity to the uniquely effective antipsychotic drug clozapine (Van Tol et al., 1991; Kapur and Remington, 2001). Moreover, a D4 gene polymorphism that causes D4 receptor dysfunction is strongly linked to attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (LaHoste et al., 1996; Rowe et al., 1998). Preclinical studies have suggested that D4 receptors are essential for the expression of hyperactivity and impulsive behaviors in a mouse model of ADHD (Avale et al., 2004). Since disturbances in synaptic transmission are the core pathophysiological feature of mental disorders (Lewis and Gonzalez-Burgos, 2006), it is conceivable that D4 receptors may be a key element in regulating the balance between glutamatergic excitation and GABAergic inhibition. In this study, we found that activation of D4 receptors induced a persistent depression of AMPAR transmission in PFC GABAergic interneurons via a mechanism involving calcineurin. Thus, D4 activation dampens the excitatory synaptic strength in GABAergic interneurons, which would lead to decreased GABAergic inhibition in the PFC circuit.To measure AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission in PFC slices, we used the standard whole-cell recording techniques (Yuen et al., 2005, 2007). Rat (3\u20134 weeks old) PFC layer I GABAergic interneurons (Zhou and Hablitz, 1996) and GAD-positive interneurons at deep layers (II\u2013V) of PFC from GAD-GFP transgenic mice (4\u20135 weeks old, The Jackson Laboratory) were used for recordings. In the GIN (GFP-expressing inhibitory neurons) transgenic mouse line, EGFP is expressed in a subpopulation of somatostatin-containing GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampus and neocortex, and the somata of EGFP-expressing interneurons are largely restricted to layers II\u2013IV and upper layer V in the neocortex (Oliva et al., 2000). Patch pipettes (5\u20138 M\u03a9) were filled with the internal solution containing the following (in mm): 130 Cs-methanesulfonate, 10 CsCl, 4 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 2.2 QX-314, 12 phosphocreatine, 5 MgATP, 0.5 Na2GTP, 0.1 leupeptin, pH 7.2\u20137.3, 265\u2013270 mOsm. PFC slices (300 \u03bcm) were perfused with oxygenated artificial CSF (ACSF) containing GABAAR antagonist bicuculline (10 \u03bcm) and NMDAR antagonist d-aminophosphonovalerate (APV, 25 \u03bcm). To record mEPSC, slices were perfused with modified ACSF containing a low concentration of MgCl2 (1 mm) and TTX (1 \u03bcm). Neurons were observed with a 40\u00d7 water-immersion lens and illuminated with near infrared (IR) light, and the image was captured with an IR-sensitive CCD camera. Recordings were performed in neurons (held at \u221270 mV) using a Multiclamp 700A amplifier (Axon Instruments). Tight seals (2\u201310 G\u03a9) were obtained by applying negative pressure. The membrane was disrupted with additional suction and the whole-cell configuration was obtained. The access resistances ranged from 13 to 18 M\u03a9 and were compensated 50\u201370%. EPSCs were evoked by stimulating the neighboring PFC neurons with a bipolar tungsten electrode (FHC). Data analyses were performed with the Clampfit software (Axon Instruments). Spontaneous synaptic events were analyzed with Mini Analysis Program (Synaptosoft). Statistical comparisons of the amplitude and frequency of mEPSC were made using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov (K\u2013S) test.Agents such as PD168077, GBR-12909, sulpiride, SCH23390, L-74172, colchicines, taxol, latrunculin, phalloidin, FK506, rapamycin, cypermethrin, cyclosporine A, okadaic acid, U73122, edelfosine (ET-18-OCH3), 2APB, heparin, and forskolin were purchased from Tocris, Calbiochem, or Sigma. Stocks were made up as concentrated stocks in water or DMSO and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. Stocks were thawed and diluted immediately before use. Antibodies used included anti-myosin V (Chemicon), anti-myosin VI (Santa Cruz), and anti-Slingshot1 (ECM Bioscience). As controls, antibodies were inactivated by heating in boiling water for 30 min before being used.Rat PFC cultures were prepared by modification of previously described methods (Yuen et al., 2005). To label surface GluR1 subunit, cultures (DIV 21\u201330) were fixed (4% paraformaldehyde, 30 min) without permeabilization, and then blocked (5% BSA, 1 h) to remove nonspecific staining. Cells were incubated with anti-GluR1 (N-terminal, 1:500, Upstate) at 4\u00b0C overnight. After three washes in PBS, cells were incubated with an Alexa 594 (red)-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200, Molecular Probes) at room temperature (RT) for 1 h. After washing, cells were permeabilized (0.2% Triton, 20 min), followed by incubation with anti-GAD (1:1000, Chemicon) for 2 h (RT) and Alexa 488 (green)-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200, Molecular Probes) for 1 h (RT). For p-cofilin staining, neurons (permeabilized) were incubated with anti-p-cofilin (1:500, Cell Signaling) for 2 h (RT). Coverslips were mounted on slides with Vectashield mounting media (Vector Laboratories).Fluorescence images were detected using a 100\u00d7 objective with a CCD camera mounted on a Nikon microscope. The surface GluR1 clusters in GAD-positive neurons were analyzed with ImageJ software. All specimens were imaged under identical conditions and analyzed with identical parameters. Several (3\u20134) dendritic segments (50 \u03bcm) with an equal distance away from the soma were selected on each neuron. For each coverslip, four to six individual neurons were chosen. Primary and secondary dendrites were analyzed separately. Clusters were detected with a threshold corresponding to twofold to threefold intensity of the diffuse fluorescence on the dendritic shaft. Three to four independent experiments were performed. Quantitative analyses were performed blindly without knowledge of experimental conditions.The small interfering RNA (siRNA) for silencing Slingshot (SSH1L) was as follows (sense): 5\u2032-UCGUCACCCAAGAAAGAUA-3\u2032 (Nishita et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2005). The SSH siRNA or a scrambled siRNA was transfected into cultured cortical neurons (21 DIV) using Lipofectamine 2000. To validate the gene silencing efficiency of Slingshot siRNA, costaining of Slingshot1 and MAP2 was performed using anti-Slingshot1 (1:500, ECM Bioscience) and anti-MAP2 (1:500, Santa Cruz). Immunocytochemical experiments for surface GluR1 or p-cofilin staining were performed 2\u20133 d after transfection.Layer I of neocortex, which receives dopaminergic innervations (Smiley et al., 1992; Sesack et al., 1995), contains exclusively GABAergic interneurons (Gabbott and Somogyi, 1986; Winer and Larue, 1989; Prieto et al., 1994) that innervate deep layers with extensive axonal plexus (Zhou and Hablitz, 1996), so we first examined whether D4 receptors might regulate AMPARs in this neuronal population. As shown in Figure 1, bath application of PD168077 (40 \u03bcm, 10 min) induced a significant reduction in the amplitude of AMPAR-EPSC in PFC layer I GABAergic interneurons (53.1 \u00b1 3.0%,  = 6), while the current was stable in control neurons when no PD168077 was administrated.D4 activation suppresses AMPAR-EPSC in PFC GABAergic interneurons. , , Plot of normalized peak AMPAR-EPSC showing the effect of the D4 agonist PD168077 (40 \u03bcm) in a rat PFC layer I interneuron () or a PFC layer V GABAergic interneuron from a GAD-GFP transgenic (GIN) mouse (). , , Plot of normalized peak AMPAR-EPSC showing the effect of PD168077 (40 \u03bcm, ) or the DAT inhibitor GBR-12909 (10 \u03bcm, coapplied with 5 \u03bcm D2/3 antagonist sulpiride and 10 \u03bcm D1/5 antagonist SCH23390, ) in the absence or presence of the D4 antagonist L-74172 (10 \u03bcm) in PFC layer V GABAergic interneurons from GIN mice. w/o, Without.

As shown in Figure 1, application of PD168077 (40 \u03bcm, 10 min) significantly decreased AMPAR-EPSC in GFP-positive neurons from GAD-GFP transgenic mice (52.4 \u00b1 3.9%,  = 9) (Fig. 1). A lower dose of PD168077 (20 \u03bcm) also produced a significant reduction of AMPAR-EPSC (21.7 \u00b1 2.0%,  = 6), albeit to a smaller extent. Application of the specific D4 antagonist L-74172 (10 \u03bcm) had little effect on AMPAR-EPSC (2.3 \u00b1 0.9%,  = 7), but significantly blocked the effect of PD168077 (9.7 \u00b1 1.7%,  = 7) (Fig. 1,), suggesting the mediation by D4 receptors.To determine whether endogenous activation of D4 receptors also affects AMPARs in PFC interneurons, we applied the specific dopamine transporter (DAT) inhibitor GBR-12909 (10 \u03bcm) to block the reuptake of dopamine. The D2/3 antagonist sulpiride (5 \u03bcm) and D1/5 antagonist SCH23390 (10 \u03bcm) were coapplied to block the activation of non-D4 dopamine receptors. As shown in Figure 1,  and , GBR-12909 significantly reduced AMPAR-EPSC in GFP-positive neurons from GAD-GFP transgenic mice (40.8 \u00b1 4.4%,  = 12), and this effect was largely blocked by the D4 antagonist L-74172 (8.2 \u00b1 1.9%,  = 9). Application of sulpiride plus SCH23390 alone had no effect on AMPAR-EPSC (data not shown). These data suggest that activation of D4 receptors, either by exogenous agonist or endogenous dopamine, induces a persistent reduction of synaptic AMPA responses in PFC GABAergic interneurons.To distinguish whether the D4 reduction of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission in interneurons results from presynaptic or postsynaptic modification, we recorded miniature EPSC (mEPSC), a response from quantal release of single glutamate vesicles. As shown in Figure 1,  and , PD168077 (40 \u03bcm, 10 min) markedly reduced the amplitude but not frequency of mEPSC (amp: 28.8 \u00b1 4.0%; freq: 5 \u00b1 2.1%,  = 7) in GFP-positive neurons from GAD-GFP transgenic mice, suggesting that a postsynaptic mechanism underlies the D4 regulation of AMPAR transmission in PFC interneurons.To examine whether the D4 reduction of AMPAR-EPSC in PFC interneurons is due to the change in AMPAR trafficking, we costained surface GluR1 and GAD in cultured cortical neurons. Dendritic segments with similar distances away from the soma were compared between control and D4 agonist-treated neurons. Segments from primary and secondary dendrites were analyzed separately. As shown in Figure 2,  and , PD168077 treatment (40 \u03bcm, 10 min) significantly decreased the cluster density (# clusters/50 \u03bcm dendrite) of surface GluR1 on the primary dendrites of GAD-positive neurons (control: 30.9 \u00b1 3.2,  = 11, PD: 15.6 \u00b1 2.6,  = 15;  < 0.001, ANOVA). The fluorescence intensity of surface GluR1 clusters (normalized to GAD immunofluorescence) was also significantly reduced by PD168077 (control: 1.1 \u00b1 0.06,  = 11, PD: 0.62 \u00b1 0.04,  = 15;  < 0.001, ANOVA). The size (\u03bcm2) of clusters was slightly but not significantly decreased (control: 0.31 \u00b1 0.04, PD: 0.26 \u00b1 0.37,  = 14). Similar reductions on surface GluR1 cluster density and intensity were found on secondary dendrites of GAD-positive neurons treated with PD168077 (Fig. 2). No change was found on GAD immunofluorescence with PD168077 treatment.D4 activation reduces surface AMPAR clusters in PFC GABAergic interneurons. , , Immunocytochemical images of surface GluR1 in cultured PFC interneurons (GAD+) treated without (control) or with PD168077 (40 \u03bcm, 10 min) in the absence or presence of L-74172 (10 \u03bcm). Enlarged versions of the boxed regions of dendrites are also shown. , Quantitative analysis of surface GluR1 clusters (density, intensity, and size) along primary and secondary dendrites in PFC interneurons treated without (\u2212) or with PD168077 in the absence or presence of L-74172. * < 0.001, ANOVA.To confirm that D4 receptors mediate the effect of PD168077 on surface GluR1 expression, we pretreated PFC cultures with the D4 antagonist L-74172. As shown in Figure 2,  and , application of L-74172 (20 \u03bcm) alone did not change the surface expression of GluR1, but blocked the effect of PD168077 on surface GluR1 cluster density on the primary dendrites of GAD-positive neurons (L-74: 32.2 \u00b1 4.3,  = 10, L-74+PD: 29.3 \u00b1 4.8,  = 12). The effect of PD168077 on GluR1 fluorescence intensity was also blocked by L-74172 (L-74: 122.6 \u00b1 13.7,  = 13, L-74+PD: 123.1 \u00b1 11.5,  = 13). Similar blocking was found on secondary dendrites of GAD-positive neurons (Fig. 2). These data suggest that D4 activation reduces the number of AMPARs at the plasma membrane of PFC GABAergic interneurons.We then examined the potential mechanism by which D4 reduces AMPAR-mediated transmission in PFC GABAergic interneurons. It has been shown that AMPAR trafficking can be regulated by actin and microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton (Kim and Lisman, 2001; Zhou et al., 2001; Derkach et al., 2007). To test whether D4 suppresses AMPAR-EPSC in PFC GABAergic interneurons via a cytoskeleton-dependent mechanism, we applied agents that perturb F-actin or MT stability. As shown in Figure 3, bath application of the F-actin destabilizer latrunculin (10 \u03bcm) caused a gradual decline of AMPAR-EPSC (53.0 \u00b1 3.5%,  = 8), and occluded the reducing effect of subsequently applied PD168077 (5.4 \u00b1 2.5%,  = 5) (Fig. 3). In contrast, application of the microtubule destabilizer colchicine (30 \u03bcm) reduced AMPAR-EPSC (50.3 \u00b1 4.7%,  = 7), but failed to occlude the effect of PD168077 (47.0 \u00b1 5.4%,  = 5) (Fig. 3). Conversely, application of the F-actin stabilizer phalloidin (10 \u03bcm) decreased AMPAR-EPSC (48.8 \u00b1 4.4%,  = 7) (Fig. 3), consistent with a previous report (Kim and Lisman, 2001), and blocked the PD168077-induced reduction of AMPAR-EPSC (3.2 \u00b1 1.5%,  = 5) (Fig. 3,). In contrast, the microtubule stabilizer taxol (10 \u03bcm) failed to alter the effect of PD168077 (44.1 \u00b1 4.6%,  = 8) (Fig. 3,). These results suggest that the dynamics of actin cytoskeleton is important for D4 regulation of AMPAR transmission in PFC GABAergic interneurons.The D4 suppression of AMPAR-EPSC in PFC GABAergic interneurons involves the transport of AMPA receptors on actin. , , Plot of normalized peak AMPAR-EPSC showing the effect of PD168077 in layer I interneurons treated with the actin destabilizer latrunculin (5 \u03bcm, ) versus the microtubule destabilizer colchicine (30 \u03bcm, ), or dialyzed with the actin stabilizer phalloidin (10 \u03bcm, ) versus the microtubule stabilizer taxol (10 \u03bcm, ). , Bar graphs (mean \u00b1 SEM) showing the percentage reduction of AMPAR-EPSC by PD168077 in the absence or presence of various agents that alter actin or microtubule-based transport. * < 0.001, ANOVA.Because of the actin dependence of the D4 action in PFC GABAergic interneurons, we would like to know whether actin-based motor proteins are also involved. Myosin Va and Vb have been implicated in GluR1 receptor trafficking in hippocampal neurons (Lis\u00e9 et al., 2006; Correia et al., 2008). Since the cortex has a large population of interneurons expressing homomeric GluR1 (Geiger et al., 1995), we speculate that D4 may suppress AMPAR-EPSC in PFC GABAergic interneurons by perturbing the actin/myosin V-based delivery of GluR1.To test this, we dialyzed neurons with an antibody against myosin V to inhibit endogenous myosin V activity. As shown in Figure 4, the myosin V antibody (10 \u03bcg/ml) produced a gradual decrease of AMPAR-EPSC in layer I interneurons (51.5 \u00b1 6.4%,  = 5). Moreover, subsequent application of PD168077 failed to decrease AMPA-EPSC further (6.5 \u00b1 2.6%,  = 7) (Fig. 4), indicating that the effect of D4 receptors was occluded. The specificity of the myosin V antibody was further confirmed with the heat-inactivated myosin V antibody, which caused little change in basal AMPAR-EPSC and was ineffective in altering the reducing effect of PD168077 (52.0 \u00b1 2.5%,  = 5) (Fig. 4,).The actin motor, myosin V, is involved in D4 regulation of AMPAR-EPSC in PFC GABAergic interneurons. , , Plot of normalized peak AMPAR-EPSC showing the effect of PD168077 (40 \u03bcm) in layer I PFC interneurons dialyzed with a myosin V antibody (10 \u03bcg/ml) versus the boiled control antibody (), or a myosin VI antibody (10 \u03bcg/ml) versus the boiled control antibody (). , Bar graphs (mean \u00b1 SEM) showing the percentage reduction of AMPAR-EPSC by PD168077 in the presence of different antibodies. * < 0.001, ANOVA.Myosin VI is another myosin that has been implicated in AMPAR trafficking (Wu et al., 2002; Osterweil et al., 2005). To test the potential involvement of myosin VI, we dialyzed neurons with an antibody against myosin VI to inhibit endogenous myosin VI activity. As shown in Figure 4, the myosin VI antibody (10 \u03bcg/ml) failed to alter basal AMPAR-EPSC and the reducing effect of PD168077 in PFC interneurons (43.8 \u00b1 4.2%,  = 5) (Fig. 4). Together, these results suggest that the D4-induced suppression of AMPAR-EPSC in PFC GABAergic interneurons involves the myosin V-mediated transport of AMPARs along actin.The functionality of the actin cytoskeleton depends on a dynamic equilibrium between filamentous and monomeric actin, thus, we speculate that D4 might regulate AMPAR trafficking and glutamatergic transmission by affecting actin dynamics. The dynamics of actin assembly is regulated by several important factors, one of which is the cofilin protein, a major actin depolymerizing factor (dos Remedios et al., 2003). The activity of cofilin is mainly regulated by phosphorylation at a single site (Ser 3). Dephosphorylation at this site greatly increases the actin-depolymerizing activity of cofilin (Morgan et al., 1993, Agnew et al., 1995).To examine the involvement of cofilin in D4 regulation of AMPAR-EPSC in PFC GABAergic interneurons, we dialyzed neurons with two peptides consisting of 1\u201316 residues of cofilin with or without Ser3-phosphorylated (Aizawa et al., 2001; Zhou et al., 2004). The p-cofilin peptide (MASPGVAVSDGVIKVFN) serves as an inhibitor of endogenous cofilin, because it binds to cofilin phosphatases and thus prevents the dephosphorylation and activation of endogenous cofilin. The nonphosphorylated cofilin peptide serves as a negative control. As shown in Figure 5,  and , dialysis with the p-cofilin peptide (50 \u03bcm) caused a reduction of AMPAR-EPSC (49.3 \u00b1 4.8%,  = 8) and abolished the effect of PD168077 in PFC GABAergic (GAD+) interneurons (5.4 \u00b1 1.4%,  = 8). In contrast, the nonphosphorylated cofilin peptide (50 \u03bcm) failed to alter the basal AMPAR-EPSC (4.7 \u00b1 1.9%,  = 7) and the reducing effect of PD168077 (38.9 \u00b1 4.3%,  = 8). These data suggest that D4 might regulate actin-based AMPAR trafficking by interfering with cofilin-mediated F-actin depolymerization in PFC GABAergic interneurons.The D4 regulation of AMPAR-EPSC in PFC GABAergic interneurons involves the actin-depolymerizing protein cofilin. , Plot of normalized peak AMPAR-EPSC as a function of time and PD168077 application in PFC GAD+ neurons (from GIN mice) dialyzed with the p-cofilin peptide (50 \u03bcm) or cofilin peptide (50 \u03bcm). , Bar graphs (mean \u00b1 SEM) showing the percentage reduction of AMPAR-EPSC by PD168077 in the absence or presence of different peptides. * < 0.001, ANOVA. , Immunocytochemical images showing the costaining of p-cofilin and GAD in cultured PFC neurons treated without or with PD168077 (40 \u03bcm, 10 min). , Bar graphs showing the p-cofilin fluorescence intensity (normalized to GAD immunofluorescence) at the somata and dendrites of control or PD168077-treated GAD+ neurons. * < 0.01, ANOVA.Next, we used a specific Ser3phospho-cofilin antibody to directly examine whether D4 activation could affect the phosphorylation and activity of cofilin in PFC interneurons. As shown in Figure 5,  and , PD168077 treatment (40 \u03bcm, 10 min) significantly decreased the Ser3-phosphorylated (inactive) cofilin level (normalized to GAD immunofluorescence) in cultured PFC GABAergic neurons (soma: 0.53 \u00b1 0.04 of control,  = 9; dendrites: 0.52 \u00b1 0.03 of control,  = 12). The total cofilin level was not altered by PD168077 (data not shown). It suggests that the actin-depolymerizing activity of cofilin is increased after D4 activation.Dephosphorylation of cofilin enables its actin severing and depolymerizing activity (Huang et al., 2006). The major phosphatase that plays a pivotal role in actin dynamics by dephosphorylating and reactivating cofilin is Slingshot (Niwa et al., 2002). In mammalian cells, Slingshot (SSH) has three isoforms, each with long and short variants. We speculate that D4 activation might increase Slingshot-mediated cofilin dephosphorylation, leading to actin depolymerization and the suppression of glutamatergic transmission in PFC GABAergic interneurons. To test this, we dialyzed neurons with a peptide, SKCLVHC468KMGVSRSAS, derived from the active site sequence in the catalytic domain of Slingshot (Niwa et al., 2002) to block the phosphatase activity of endogenous Slingshot. The same peptide with a point mutation at the Cys residue in the catalytic pocket, C468S, was used as an inactive control (Niwa et al., 2002). Dialysis with the Slingshot peptide (100 \u03bcm) induced a gradual decline of AMPAR-EPSC (35.2 \u00b1 9.6%,  = 5), and subsequent application of PD168077 failed to reduce AMPAR-EPSC further (8.3 \u00b1 2.0%,  = 5) (Fig. 6,) in PFC layer I interneurons. In contrast, the inactive control peptide (100 \u03bcm) had no effect on basal AMPAR-EPSC, and failed to alter the effect of PD168077 on AMPAR-EPSC (41.0 \u00b1 4.9%,  = 4) (Fig. 6).The cofilin phosphatase Slingshot (SSH) is involved in D4 regulation of AMPARs in PFC GABAergic interneurons. , , Plot of normalized peak AMPAR-EPSC as a function of time and PD168077 application in PFC interneurons dialyzed with a Slingshot peptide (100 \u03bcm, ) versus the C468S mutant peptide (100 \u03bcm, ), or a Slingshot1 antibody (10 \u03bcg/ml, ) versus the heat-inactivated antibody (). , Bar graphs (mean \u00b1 SEM) summarizing the percentage reduction of AMPAR-EPSC by PD168077 in the presence of different agents that affect Slingshot activity. * < 0.001, ANOVA. , Immunocytochemical images of surface GluR1 in cultured PFC interneurons (GAD+) transfected with a scrambled control siRNA or SSH1 siRNA either untreated (control) or treated with PD168077 (40 \u03bcm, 10 min).

Dialysis with the Slingshot1 antibody caused a reduction of AMPAR-EPSC (43.6 \u00b1 6.2%,  = 7), and prevented PD168077 from reducing AMPAR-EPSC in PFC GABAergic (GAD+) interneurons (6.3 \u00b1 1.8%,  = 9) (Fig. 6,). In contrast, the heat-inactivated Slingshot1 antibody did not alter the basal AMPAR-EPSC (4.6 \u00b1 1.6%,  = 8) or the reducing effect of PD168077 (44 \u00b1 6.1%,  = 7) (Fig. 6).Next, we examined the role of Slingshot in D4 regulation of AMPAR trafficking by knocking down Slingshot1 in PFC cultures with siRNA transfection. As shown in Figure 6, the Slingshot1 siRNA caused a specific and effective suppression of the expression of this phosphatase, which is likely to induce its functional inactivation. In GAD-positive neurons transfected with a scrambled control siRNA (Fig. 6,), PD168077 treatment (40 \u03bcm, 10 min) significantly decreased the surface GluR1 cluster density (control: 29.6 \u00b1 2.3 clusters/50 \u03bcm dendrite, PD: 16 \u00b1 1.8 clusters/50 \u03bcm dendrite,  = 11;  < 0.001, ANOVA) and fluorescence intensity (normalized to GAD immunofluorescence) (control: 1.09 \u00b1 0.1, PD: 0.71 \u00b1 0.06,  = 11;  < 0.001, ANOVA). However, in GAD-positive neurons transfected with Slingshot1 siRNA (Fig. 6,), surface GluR1 showed significantly ( < 0.001, ANOVA) reduced cluster density (17.6 \u00b1 2.8 clusters/50 \u03bcm dendrite,  = 12) and fluorescence intensity (normalized to GAD immunofluorescence) (0.66 \u00b1 0.06,  = 12), and application of PD168077 had no further effect (cluster density: 17.4 \u00b1 1.8 clusters/50 \u03bcm dendrite,  = 10; normalized cluster intensity: 0.68 \u00b1 0.08,  = 10). Together, these data suggest that Slingshot, the major phosphatase regulating cofilin activity and ensuing actin dynamics, is a key molecule linking D4 receptors to actin-based AMPAR trafficking in PFC GABAergic interneurons.Next, we examined the possible mechanism underlying D4 activation of Slingshot. Our previous studies show that D4 activation triggers the PLC/IP3/Ca2+ pathway (Gu and Yan, 2004; Gu et al., 2006). Since cortical GABAergic interneurons do not express CaMKII (Benson et al., 1992), the major substrate of Ca2+ is likely to be calcineurin. Calcineurin has been found to dephosphorylate Slingshot1 and increase the cofilin-phosphatase activity of Slingshot1 in cell-free assays (Wang et al., 2005).To test the possibility that the actin-dependent D4 suppression of glutamatergic transmission in PFC GABAergic interneurons is through activation of calcineurin, we applied the calcineurin inhibitor FK506. Rapamycin, which is structurally similar to FK506 but does not inhibit calcineurin (Liu, 1993), was used as a control. As shown in Figure 7, PD168077 failed to decrease AMPAR-EPSC in the interneuron loaded with FK506 (5 \u03bcm, 5.8 \u00b1 1.8%,  = 5) (Fig. 7), while the effect of PD168077 was intact in the interneuron dialyzed with rapamycin (10 \u03bcm, 42.6 \u00b1 4.3%,  = 5) (Fig. 7). To substantiate that the effect of FK506 on D4 regulation of AMPAR-EPSC is due to inhibition of calcineurin, we applied another specific calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporine A. As shown in Figure 7, cyclosporine A (20 \u03bcm) blocked the PD168077-induced reduction of AMPAR-EPSC (7.0 \u00b1 2.6%,  = 6) (Fig. 7), while internal application of the PP1/2A inhibitor okadaic acid (OA, 1 \u03bcm) was ineffective (43.6 \u00b1 4.3%,  = 5) (Fig. 7). Injecting cypermethrin (10 \u03bcm), which inhibits calcineurin via mechanisms distinct from that of FK506 (Enan and Matsumura, 1992; Liu, 1993), also blocked the reducing effect of PD168077 on AMPAR-EPSC (5.0 \u00b1 3.5%,  = 5) (Fig. 7). In contrast, dialysis with KN-93 (20 \u03bcm), an inhibitor for Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases, failed to alter the effect of PD168077 (45.6 \u00b1 4.0%,  = 4) (Fig. 7). None of these inhibitors alone significantly affected the basal AMPAR-EPSC (FK506: 4.8 \u00b1 3.2%,  = 5; rapamycin: 2.8 \u00b1 1%,  = 6; cyclosporine A: 5.8 \u00b1 2.4%,  = 6; OA: 8.8 \u00b1 1.7%,  = 7; cypermethrin: 3.3 \u00b1 1.2%,  = 5; KN-93: 5.0 \u00b1 1.2%,  = 5). These results suggest that calcineurin is specifically involved in D4 regulation of glutamatergic transmission in PFC GABAergic interneurons.Calcineurin activity is required for D4 regulation of AMPAR-EPSC in PFC GABAergic interneurons. , , Plot of normalized peak AMPAR-EPSC as a function of time and PD168077 application in PFC layer I interneurons dialyzed with the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 (5 \u03bcm, ) versus its inactive analog rapamycin (10 \u03bcm, ), or the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine A (20 \u03bcm, ) versus the PP1/2A inhibitor okadaic acid (OA, 1 \u03bcm, ). , Bar graphs (mean \u00b1 SEM) summarizing the percentage reduction of AMPAR-EPSC by PD168077 in the presence of different phosphatase or kinase inhibitors. * < 0.001, ANOVA. , , Immunocytochemical images showing the costaining of p-cofilin and GAD in cultured PFC neurons (: untreated vs FK506-pretreated; : scrambled siRNA-transfected vs Slingshot1 siRNA-transfected) treated without or with PD168077 (40 \u03bcm, 10 min). , , Bar graphs showing the p-cofilin fluorescence intensity (normalized to GAD immunofluorescence) at the dendrites of control or PD168077-treated interneurons (GAD+) under different conditions. * < 0.01, ANOVA.To provide more direct evidence about the involvement of calcineurin/Slingshot signaling in D4 regulation of AMPARs, we examined whether D4 affects the activity of cofilin in PFC interneurons through a mechanism depending on calcineurin and Slingshot. As shown in Figure 7,  and , the reducing effect of PD168077 (40 \u03bcm, 10 min) on the level of p-cofilin (inactive) was blocked by pretreatment with the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 (2 \u03bcm, 30 min) in cultured PFC GABAergic (GAD+) neurons (untreated: 0.58 \u00b1 0.03 of control,  = 10; FK506-treated: 0.96 \u00b1 0.06 of control,  = 11). FK506 alone did not affect the level of p-cofilin (0.98 \u00b1 0.13 of control,  = 11). Moreover, PD168077 significantly reduced the level of p-cofilin in neurons transfected with a scrambled siRNA (0.63 \u00b1 0.07 of control,  = 9) (Fig. 7,), while neurons transfected with the Slingshot1 siRNA showed a significant increase in the level of p-cofilin (1.33 \u00b1 0.05 of control,  = 11), and prevented PD168077 from decreasing it (1.4 \u00b1 0.12 of control,  = 11) (Fig. 7,). These data suggest that D4 regulates actin dynamics in PFC interneurons through activation of Slingshot via calcineurin.Finally, we examined whether the D4-triggered PLC/IP3/Ca2+ pathway is potentially responsible for the activation of calcineurin, which leads to the actin/cofilin-dependent suppression of glutamatergic transmission in PFC GABAergic interneurons. As shown in Figure 8, injecting a high concentration (10 mm) of BAPTA, the potent Ca2+ chelator, blocked the PD168077-induced reduction of AMPAR-EPSC (low BAPTA: 52.8 \u00b1 3.8%,  = 6; high BAPTA: 9.0 \u00b1 2.6%,  = 5) (Fig. 8). The effect of PD168077 was also largely blocked by two inhibitors of PLC (Fig. 8), U73122 (10 \u03bcm, 11.2 \u00b1 3.3%,  = 5) (Fig. 8) and edelfosine (50 \u03bcm) (Powis et al., 1992) (6.3 \u00b1 2.4%,  = 6) (Fig. 8). Similarly, two inhibitors for IP3R, 2APB (15 \u03bcm) and heparin (1 mg/ml, Takei et al., 1998), almost abolished the PD168077-induced reduction of AMPAR-EPSC (2APB: 6.8 \u00b1 2.4%,  = 5; heparin: 9.0 \u00b1 1.8%,  = 6) (Fig. 8,). Since D4 can also be linked to the inhibition of PKA pathway (Wang et al., 2002, 2003; Gu and Yan, 2004), we also examined the role of PKA in D4 regulation of AMPAR-EPSC in PFC GABAergic interneurons. As shown in Figure 8, the effect of PD168077 was intact in the presence of the PKA activator forskolin (10 \u03bcm, 50 \u00b1 3.5%,  = 5) (Fig. 8), which rules out the involvement of PKA.The PLC/IP3/Ca2+ pathway is involved in D4 regulation of AMPAR-EPSC in PFC GABAergic interneurons. , Plot of normalized peak AMPAR-EPSC in PFC interneurons injected with the internal solution containing a high (10 mm) or low (0.1 mm) concentration of BAPTA (), the PLC inhibitor U73122 (10 \u03bcm, ) or edelfosine (50 \u03bcm, ), the IP3R inhibitor 2APB (15 \u03bcm, ) or heparin (1 mg/ml, ), or the PKA activator forskolin (10 \u03bcm, ). , Bar graphs (mean \u00b1 SEM) showing the percentage reduction of AMPAR-EPSC by PD168077 in the presence of different agents. * < 0.001, ANOVA.Based on our results, we propose the following model that may underlie the mechanism for the D4 regulation of glutamatergic transmission in PFC GABAergic interneurons (Fig. 9). Activation of D4 receptors in these cells causes a strong increase of calcineurin (CaN) activity, presumably via the PLC/IP3/Ca2+ cascade. CaN activation results in the increased activity of Slingshot (SSH), a major cofilin-specific phosphatase (Niwa et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2005). SSH induces dephosphorylation and activation of cofilin, a major actin depolymerizing factor (dos Remedios et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2006), leading to the disruption of actin filament dynamics. Consequently, the myosin V motor-mediated transport of GluR1-containing vesicles along actin is interfered, and therefore the AMPAR-mediated synaptic current is significantly reduced.A schematic model for the D4 regulation of AMPARs in PFC GABAergic interneurons. D4 receptors activate calcineurin (CaN), leading to the increased activity of Slingshot (SSH). SSH induces dephosphorylation and activation of cofilin, resulting in actin depolymerization. Consequently, the myosin V motor-mediated transport of GluR1-containing vesicles along actin is interfered, causing the reduction of surface AMPAR clusters and AMPAR-mediated synaptic currents.Although GABAergic interneurons only account for \u223c20% of the cortical neuronal population (Hendry et al., 1987), they are critical elements of cortical circuits by providing feedforward and feedback inhibition and synchronizing cortical activity (Galarreta and Hestrin, 1999; Cruikshank et al., 2007). PFC GABAergic interneurons are crucial for the gamma oscillations, which reflect the synchronization of pyramidal neuron activity during working memory processes (Tallon-Baudry et al., 1998; Howard et al., 2003). Thus, the abnormal neural synchrony and working memory disturbances in schizophrenia may be attributable to impairments in PFC GABAergic inhibition (Spencer et al., 2003; Lewis et al., 2005). In the present study, we have demonstrated that the excitatory synaptic strength in PFC GABAergic neurons is downregulated by dopamine D4 receptors. While cortical interneurons of different classes are often modulated by neurotransmitters in distinct, subtype-specific manners (Bacci et al., 2005), this regulatory effect of D4 receptors on AMPAR-EPSC is similar in all the tested GABAergic interneurons located in layer I or deep layers (II\u2013V) of PFC. It provides a mechanistic link between dopamine, glutamate, and GABA transmission in PFC, all of which are crucial for cognitive processes mediated by PFC (Lewis and Gonzalez-Burgos, 2006). The D4-induced suppression of the excitatory drive to GABAergic interneurons could lead to reduced feedforward inhibition to PFC pyramidal neurons. This D4 action, in combination with the D4-induced decrease of GABAergic transmission in PFC pyramidal neurons (Wang et al., 2002), could synergistically increase the excitatory output of PFC.Our combined electrophysiological and immunocytochemical data suggest that the D4 reduction of AMPAR-EPSC in PFC interneurons is through changing the actin-based trafficking of AMPA receptors to the synaptic membrane. Actin filaments are enriched at synapses where they undergo dynamic polymerization and depolymerization. Depolymerization of F-actin leads to the redistribution of AMPAR clusters to nonsynaptic sites in GABAergic neurons of hippocampal cultures (Allison et al., 1998) and enhances the internalization of AMPA receptors (Zhou et al., 2001). Disruption of the interaction of GluR1 with the actin-binding protein 4.1N also causes a reduction of the surface AMPAR level (Shen et al., 2000). By using specific agents to perturb actin or microtubule cytoskeletons, we have identified actin as the basis of D4-regulated AMPAR trafficking in PFC interneurons. Interestingly, not only the actin destabilizer (latrunculin), but also the actin stabilizer (phalloidin), caused a gradual decline of AMPAR-EPSC and prevented the effect of subsequently activated D4 receptors. It suggests that the dynamics of actin cytoskeleton is critical for AMPAR trafficking. Changing the dynamic equilibrium between filamentous and monomeric actin in either direction will lead to the reduced functional AMPARs at the synaptic membrane.Myosins are motor proteins that move on F-actin, which are essential for a multitude of cellular processes, including membrane trafficking, cell movements, and signal transduction (Mermall et al., 1998). Myosin V and myosin VI have been implicated in glutamate receptor trafficking. Myosin Va associates with AMPARs through its cargo-binding domain and mediates the CaMKII-triggered GluR1 translocation from dendritic shafts to spines (Correia et al., 2008), while overexpression of dominant negative myosin Vb reduces the surface expression of GluR1-containing AMPARs in cultured hippocampal neurons (Lis\u00e9 et al., 2006). In addition, myosin VI exists in a complex with AMPAR GluR1 and the scaffolding protein SAP97 in rat brain (Wu et al., 2002; Osterweil et al., 2005). Myosin VI-deficient hippocampus exhibits synapse loss and a significant deficit in the stimulation-induced internalization of AMPARs (Osterweil et al., 2005). By using specific antibodies to block the function of endogenous myosins, we have identified myosin V as the motor involved in D4 regulation of AMPAR trafficking on actin.Cofilin, the actin-binding protein that is essential for the high rates of actin filament turnover through regulation of actin polymerization/depolymerization cycles (dos Remedios et al., 2003), provides a phosphoregulatory mechanism for actin reorganization (Bamburg, 1999; Huang et al., 2006). It is inactivated by phosphorylation at Ser3, and reactivated by dephosphorylation of this site (Morgan et al., 1993, Agnew et al., 1995). Thus cofilin phosphorylation/dephosphorylation at the critical Ser3 residue acts as a switch for actin assembly (F-actin stabilization) and disassembly (F-actin severing). By using a Ser3-phosphorylated cofilin peptide (Aizawa et al., 2001; Zhou et al., 2004) to inhibit the activation of endogenous cofilin, we have demonstrated that the D4 regulation of AMPAR-EPSC requires cofilin. Consistently, using a Ser3-phospho cofilin antibody, we have shown that D4 receptors increase the actin-depolymerizing activity of cofilin in PFC GABAergic interneurons.Slingshot has been identified as the major phosphatase that dephosphorylates and activates cofilin, therefore playing a pivotal role in actin dynamics (Niwa et al., 2002). By cofilin regulation, Slingshot induces highly motile growth cones and enhances neurite extension rates (Endo et al., 2003). Slingshot contains a protein phosphatase domain with a canonical catalytic HCxxGxxR sequence found in protein tyrosine phosphatases and dual-specificity phosphatases (Niwa et al., 2002). Using a peptide derived from this sequence to block the phosphatase activity of endogenous Slingshot, we have demonstrated the involvement of Slingshot in D4 regulation of AMPAR-EPSC. The Slingshot1 antibody data provide another piece of evidence to complement the peptide experiments. Moreover, we have shown that knockdown of Slingshot1 expression by RNA interference reduces AMPAR surface clusters and prevents the effect of D4 in PFC GABAergic interneurons, suggesting that Slingshot is a novel regulator of AMPAR trafficking in central neurons.Slingshot phosphatase activity is regulated by multiple proteins, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (Nishita et al., 2004), F-actin, and 14-3-3 (Nagata-Ohashi et al., 2004). Biochemical assays show that calcineurin dephosphorylates SSH1L and increases its phosphatase activity, suggesting that the Ca2+-induced cofilin dephosphorylation and actin depolymerization are mediated by calcineurin-dependent activation of Slingshot (Wang et al., 2005). Consistently, it has been found that calcineurin is enriched at synapses together with F-actin and mediates the rapid loss of F-actin puncta at synapses induced by NMDA treatment in cultured hippocampal neurons (Halpain et al., 1998). Using specific inhibitors, we have demonstrated that the D4 regulation of AMPAR-EPSC requires calcineurin, which is likely to be activated by the PLC/IP3/Ca2+ pathway (Gu and Yan, 2004; Gu et al., 2006). Because of its high affinity to calcium, calcineurin may play a particularly important role in cortical interneurons, which express calcium-binding proteins and Ca2+ permeable AMPARs (Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1993; Geiger et al., 1995). In agreement with this, infusion of a calcineurin inhibitor in rat PFC has been shown to significantly impair working memory (Runyan et al., 2005).Together, our results indicate that activation of D4 receptors induces a marked depression of the actin-based AMPAR trafficking and excitatory transmission in PFC GABAergic interneurons via the calcineurin/Slingshot/cofilin pathway. It provides a potential mechanism for D4 receptors to regulate PFC inhibitory neurons, which is a critical element for controlling cortical functions (McBain and Fisahn, 2001; Lewis et al., 2005).This work was supported by grants from National Institutes of Health (MH084233, NS048911) to Z.Y.

DCX\u2212/\u2212 mice have been generated to investigate this issue. However, they display no neocortical abnormality, lessening their impact on the field. In contrast,  knockdown of DCX RNA produces a morphologically relevant cortical band heterotopia in rodents. On this preparation we have now compared the neuronal and network properties of ectopic, overlying, and control neurons in an effort to identify how ectopic neurons generate adverse patterns that will impact cortical activity. We combined dynamic calcium imaging and anatomical and electrophysiological techniques and report now that DCX\u2212/\u2212EGFP+-labeled ectopic neurons that fail to migrate develop extensive axonal subcortical projections and retain immature properties, and most of them display a delayed maturation of GABA-mediated signaling. Cortical neurons overlying the heterotopia, in contrast, exhibit a massive increase of ongoing glutamatergic synaptic currents reflecting a strong reactive plasticity. Neurons in both experimental fields are more frequently coactive in coherent synchronized oscillations than control cortical neurons. In addition, both fields displayed network-driven oscillations during evoked epileptiform burst. These results show that migration disorders produce major alterations not only in neurons that fail to migrate but also in their programmed target areas. We suggest that this duality play a major role in cortical dysfunction of DCX brains.Cortical malformations represent a broad spectrum of developmental disorders resulting from genetic mutations or environmental perturbations that affect cellular proliferation, migration, or differentiation during development (Schwartzkroin and Walsh, 2000; Mochida and Walsh, 2004; Guerrini et al., 2008). They are often associated with patients having severe epilepsies or cognitive defects (Mischel et al., 1995; Porter et al., 2003). Thus, cortical malformations are present in <24% of all epilepsy patients but are found in 40% of cases that are refractory to treatment (Hardiman et al., 1988; Farrell et al., 1992). Anatomical and functional studies in rodents with cortical malformations suggest that ectopic neurons form afferent and efferent connections with adjacent cortex (for review, see Chevassus-Au-Louis and Represa, 1999), indicating that heterotopias are integrated within cortical networks. However, it is still not clear how malformed networks of neurons may contribute to pathophysiological development in an otherwise normal brain.Mutations of doublecortin (DCX) and LIS-1, two microtubule-stabilizing proteins expressed in immature neurons that are important for migration (Francis et al., 1999; Bai et al., 2003; Tanaka et al., 2004), are among the best characterized genetic disruptions leading to lissencephaly and subcortical band heterotopia in humans (Dobyns et al., 1993; Reiner et al., 1993; des Portes et al., 1998; Gleeson et al., 1998; Pilz et al., 1999). Although functional knock-out models have been generated for these two genetic disorders, progress has been hindered by the fact that these animals displayed embryonic lethality (Hirotsune et al., 1998; Cahana et al., 2001) and little or no dysgenesis in the neocortex (Corbo et al., 2002). Because these models do display discrete hippocampal dysplasias (Hirotsune et al., 1998; Fleck et al., 2000; Nosten-Bertrand et al., 2008), detailed physiological analyses thus far have concerned only the hippocampal pyramidal layer (Fleck et al., 2000; Jones and Baraban, 2007; Nosten-Bertrand et al., 2008).More relevant models of these disorders have been achieved by using the techniques of gene silencing. Thus, reduction of DCX expression in rats using RNA interference (RNAi) via  electroporation results in formation of heterotopias beneath the neocortical layers similar to those seen in human patients (Bai et al., 2003), thus providing a unique opportunity to determine the properties of misplaced neurons and characterize cortical networks in a well designed genetic model of a human developmental disorder. For the first time we investigate here neuronal and networks activities in the DCX RNAi model for subcortical band heterotopia by combining network-level calcium imaging with electrophysiological and anatomical approaches. We found that ectopic (double cortex) neurons display a delayed maturation of functional GABAergic synaptic inputs, whereas cortical L2/3 neurons overlying the heterotopia (experimental cortex) displayed an increased glutamatergic drive. In addition, we show that experimental fields (heterotopia and experimental cortex) were integrated within the same network and exhibited synchronized activity during epileptiform burst. Ectopic neurons also develop extensive subcortical axonal arborizations that might contribute to integrate the heterotopia in cortical\u2013subcortical loops. Together these alterations could have important consequences for cortical function and may be involved in the neurological manifestations linked to this type of disorder, such as infantile and childhood epilepsy.Wistar rats (Janvier) were mated, cared for, and used in our animal facilities in agreement with European Union and French legislation. Timed pregnant rats [embryonic day 15 (E15)\u2013E16] were anesthetized with a mixture ketamine/xylazine (at 100 and 10 mg/kg, respectively). The uterine horns were exposed, and a lateral ventricle of each embryo was injected via pulled glass capillaries and a microinjector (Picospritzer II; General Valve Corporation) with Fast Green (2 mg/ml; Sigma) combined with the following DNA constructs: 1.5 mg/ml pCAGGS-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) alone or 1.5 mg/ml short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting the 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) of  or a mismatch  described previously (Bai et al., 2003) and 0.5 mg/ml pCAG-EGFP construct. This step was followed by  electroporation by discharging a 500 F capacitor charged to 70 V with a BTX exponential decay wave electroporator (BTX Harvard Apparatus). The voltage was discharged across copper alloy oval plates placed on the uterine wall across the head of the embryo. All recordings were performed from slices having heterotopia located directly under parietal cortex as defined by the rat atlas of Paxinos and Watson (1997) and were located between +2.1 and \u22123.7 mm with respect to bregma according to the postnatal rat atlas of Sherwood (mean: \u22120.23 mm, SD: 1.7 mm). Control slices were chosen to match the rostrocaudal distribution of experimental slices.Experiments were performed on neocortical slices from Wistar rats (control rats or transfected with either EGFP alone or combined with DCX RNAi or DCX mismatch; ages ranged from postnatal day 9 (P9) to P15. In addition, few recordings have been performed at P30. Rats were decapitated under deep isoflurane anesthesia (20\u201340 mg/kg). Brains were rapidly removed and placed in oxygenated ice-cooled artificial CSF (ACSF) with the following composition (in mm): 126 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.3 MgCl2, 25 NaHCO3, 1.2 NaHPO4, and 10 d-glucose (95% O2 and 5% CO2, pH 7.4). Coronal neocortical slices (350\u2013400 \u03bcm) were obtained with a vibratome and kept in oxygenated ACSF at room temperature at least 1 h before use. Individual slices were then transferred to the recording chamber, where they were fully submerged and superfused with ACSF at \u223c36\u00b0C at a rate of 2\u20133 ml/min. EGFP-positive neuron were visualized with a fluorescent upright microscope (Axioscope; Zeiss) equipped with an appropriate filter and recorded using the patch-clamp technique in the whole-cell configuration. Microelectrodes had a resistance of 5\u201310 M\u03a9 and were filled with a solution containing the following (in mm): 130 KM2SO4, 10 KCl, 0.1 CaCl2, 1.1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg2+ATP, and 0.3 Na+GTP, pH 7.25; 270\u2013280 mOsm. Biocytin (0.5%) was also added to the pipette solution for  reconstruction of the recorded cells (see below). Some experiments have been performed with a Cs gluconate (CsGlu)-based pipette solution (in mm): 130 CsGlu, 10 CsCl, 0.1 CaCl2, 1.1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg2+ATP, and 0.3 Na+GTP. Whole-cell measurements in voltage-clamp or current-clamp mode were filtered at 3 kHz using an EPC-9 amplifier (HEKA). All electrophysiological data were digitized (1\u20132 kHz) with a Digidata (Molecular Devices) interface card to a personal computer and analyzed with MiniAnalysis (Synaptosoft). Each single event in each recorded cell was fully characterized by the following parameters: rise time (10\u201390%), amplitude, and decay time constants were calculated using MiniAnalysis 5.1. The baseline noise ranged between 3 and 5 pA, and an amplitude threshold of 3 pA more than the baseline noise was used for event detection. All voltage reported were corrected values for liquid junction potential (LJP) with \nm = \npipette \u2212 LJP. The LJP for KM2SO4- and CsGlu-based pipette solutions were 3.2 and 18 mV, respectively. In some experiments, isoguvacine (30 \u03bcm) was applied by pressure during 1 s with a patch pipette connected to a Picospritzer (General Valve Corporation) and positioned close to the soma. Extracellular recordings were performed with a glass pipette (<1 M\u03a9) filled with ACSF to record the field, and the signal was recorded with a DAM80 amplifier (WPI). Slices were stimulated by a bipolar twisted nichrome electrode connected to a stimulator (Grass Instruments). The stimulus intensity ranged between 10 and 100 V of amplitude, and the duration was 30 \u03bcs.Ectopic neurons (either in the white matter or deep cortical layers) were selected using epifluorescence microscopy;  analysis demonstrated that all ectopic neurons recorded (biocytin injected) were EGFP positive. Experimental L2/3 (expL2/3) recorded neurons were all EGFP negative.All values are given as means \u00b1 SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using SigmaStat 3.1 (Systat Software). For comparison between two groups, the unpaired Student's  test was used if the data passed the normality and the equal variance test; otherwise, the Mann\u2013Whitney rank-sum test was used. The level of significance was set at  < 0.05.  refers to the number of cells, except when otherwise stated.Coronal slices (380 \u03bcm) were prepared from postnatal rats as described above. For calcium indicator loading, slices were incubated in a small chamber containing 2 ml of oxygenated ACSF with 25 \u03bcl of 1 mm fura-2 AM solution (Invitrogen; in 100% DMSO) for 25 min at 35\u00b0C.Two-photon imaging was performed as described previously (Cr\u00e9pel et al., 2007). Briefly experiments were performed at 32\u00b0C in oxygenated ACSF using a multibeam two-photon laser-scanning system (Chameleon Ti:Sapphire laser, Coherent; and TriM scanhead, LaVision BioTec) coupled to an Olympus BX51W1 microscope. Excitation wavelengths were 780 \u03bcm for fura-2 imaging and 910 \u03bcm for EGFP imaging. Imaging was performed using a 20\u00d7 0.95 numerical aperture objective (XLUMPLFL, Olympus) and a CCD camera (LaVision Imager Intense) with an acquisition rate of \u223c140 ms/frame and a field of view of 413 \u00d7 312 \u03bcm. Each recording consisted of a single, continuously acquired movie during a period of 90\u2013180 s.Antagonists for GABAA receptors (bicuculline, 10 \u03bcm; Sigma) or glutamate receptors [2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfonyl-benzo[]quinoxaline (NBQX) and APV, both 10 \u03bcm; Sigma] were perfused onto slices for 12\u201315 min before optical recording. After calcium imaging experiments, slices were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and imaged using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Olympus Fluoview).Image processing was performed using ImageJ 1.37 (NIH) and custom software in MATLAB (The MathWorks) described previously (Cr\u00e9pel et al., 2007). Cell contours were identified using a combination of automatic and visual detection routines. Calcium signals of each cell were the average fluorescence intensity inside each cell soma region of interest, measured as a function of time (d/). Calcium events were manually identified, with automatic detection routines confirming events as local minima (typically <\u22122 SD of the derivative of the signal). Data were analyzed using custom routines written in MATLAB (The MathWorks) and in R (The R Project for Statistical Computing). Event offsets were set as the half-amplitude decay time for each event. Event onset times were quantified as the half-amplitude rise time of each calcium transient. Active cells were neurons exhibiting at least one calcium event during a recording period. The power spectral density (PSD) estimate for each cell's d/ time series was calculated using Welch's method (\u201cpwelch\u201d function, MATLAB). Spontaneously active neurons displaying rhythmic calcium transients exhibit PSD estimates that are shifted toward higher signal power per frequency (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Average power was computed as the approximate integral of the PSD on the intervals [0\u2013Nyquist frequency (\u223c3.5 Hz)], [0.005\u20130.1 Hz], or [0.1\u20131 Hz]. Peak coactive network activity was quantified as the maximum percentage of cells exhibiting a calcium event at one time during a recording period. To quantify temporally correlated calcium events across cells in a network, event onset times were represented by a Gaussian (\u03c3 = 1 frame) for each cell. Interval reshuffling was then performed for each movie as described previously (Mao et al., 2001; Cossart et al., 2003). The significance of cross-correlation values for real datasets was determined through comparison with distributions calculated from the randomized datasets using a threshold significance level of  < 0.05. Event frequencies are reported as the mean or median frequency value from active cells across all recordings. Datasets that followed a lognormal distribution were log-transformed before comparison (calcium event onset, duration, and frequency datasets). Distribution means for cell-based or event-based datasets were compared using ANOVA ( < 0.05 set as significance) followed by pairwise  tests with Holm correction. Distributions of movie-based datasets were compared using the nonparametric Kruskal\u2013Wallis and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Measurements are reported as mean \u00b1 SEM, unless otherwise noted.Brains from postnatal rats (P12) were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4% in PBS). Brain sections (50 \u03bcm) were obtained with a vibratome (Leica) and permeabilized for 10 min at room temperature (RT) in PBS\u2013Triton X-100 (0.1%)\u2013goat serum (5%). After permeabilization, slices were incubated overnight at RT with rabbit anti-GAD65/67 (1:400, Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents), vGlut1 (1:1000; Synaptic Systems), or NeuN (1:1000, Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents) combined with mouse anti-GFP antibodies (1:2000; Invitrogen). The slices were rinsed three times in PBS and incubated for 2 h at RT in Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies and then Alexa-488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (both diluted 1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch). Experiments were repeated three times with sections from four different brains per developmental stage.Revelation of biocytin-injected neurons was obtained with Cy3-conjugated streptavidin (1:500; Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents) combined with anti-GFP antibodies (see before) for staining of transfected cells.Sections were examined under a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope using 10\u00d7, 20\u00d7, and 65\u00d7 objectives; images were digitized using the built-in software and exported in tiff format for quantitative analysis with the analysis software ImageJ 1.33d (Wayne Rasband, NIH). Optical fluorescence density was measured in the hippocampus, neocortex, and corpus callosum as described previously (Epsztein et al., 2006).We used  electroporation to deliver RNAi constructs into neural progenitors at the ventricular zone surface allowing for spatiotemporally restricted transfection in a population of neuronal precursors. Expression of an RNAi construct targeting the 3\u2032-UTR of DCX (Bai et al., 2003) in a cohort of immature neurons results in arrested migration through the intermediate zone and the formation of ectopic clusters of neurons in the white matter. Because the electroporations were performed at E15 (Fig. 1\n), a cohort of cells destined to be primarily layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramids (Fig. 1\n,) were affected. Transfected cells (EGFP+) that received DCX RNAi formed heterotopic (het) masses in the white matter or remained within deeper cortical layers, in contrast to the L2/3 pyramidal fate of control neurons transfected with either EGFP (Fig. 1; supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) or mismatch constructs (data not shown). The ectopic EGFP-positive cells expressed the neuronal marker NeuN (Fig. 1\n) but not GABAergic (GAD65/67) or glial (GFAP) cell markers (also see Ramos et al., 2006). Ectopic neurons exhibited multipolar or bipolar tangential morphologies (Fig. 1\n,; supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Ectopic neurons originate axonal arbors that reached the corpus callosum and can be followed for long distances, this including the contralateral hemisphere; collateral branches reached upper cortical layers. In addition many axonal branches were observed to invade the striatum (caudate\u2013putamen) (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).Heterotopia formation by DCX RNAi. \n\n, RNAi of DCX protein expression by  electroporation of a plasmid encoding a DCXshRNA. Electroporation of the ventricular zone with EGFP + DCXshRNA plasmids (EGFP + DCX RNAi) at E16 inhibits neuronal migration and results in formation of a band of EGFP+ ectopic neurons in the white matter, whereas electroporation of EGFP plasmid alone results in EGFP+ layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. \n\n, NeuN labeling within an EGFP+ heterotopia. Notice the presence of colabeling of EGFP+ ectopic neurons with NeuN in a single confocal -section. Also notice the presence of NeuN-positive EGFP-negative (untransfected) neurons, which are likely retained within the heterotopia by a cell-population effect as described previously (Ramos et al., 2006). Scale bar, 50 \u03bcm. \n\n, \n\n, \n\n, \n\n, Confocal images of rat cerebral cortex after either control (EGFP only) electroporation (\n\n, \n\n) or EGFP + DCXshRNA electroporation (\n\n, \n\n). A subcortical band heterotopia has formed in the corpus callosum (c.c.). In contrast to the radial orientation and pyramidal morphology of EGFP+ neurons in layer 2/3, ectopic neurons in the white matter are tangentially oriented with elongated bipolar or multipolar morphologies. Scale bars: \n\n, \n\n, 100 \u03bcm; \n\n, \n\n, 50 \u03bcm. \n\n, The staining of biocytin-filled ectopic neurons (red) from whole-cell recordings reveals the colabeling of EGFP (green) for both of the patched cells. Scale bar, 25 \u03bcm. \n\n, \n\n, Pattern of discharge of two different EGFP+ ectopic neurons representative of 72% (\n\n) and 28% (\n\n) of ectopic recorded neurons recorded with a KM2SO4-based pipette solution. The discharge was evoked either by depolarizing steps (left) or by progressive injection of currents (right).Electrophysiological recording of ectopic cells were performed to further assess their neuronal features and evaluate their main intrinsic properties. Patch clamp recordings of these cells revealed that they have a mean resting membrane potential of \u221258 \u00b1 1.3 mV (range between \u221250 mV and \u221273 mV; measured in whole cell with a KM2SO4-based pipette solution) and a mean input resistance of 635 \u00b1 65 m\u03a9 and generate action potentials when they were depolarized either by depolarizing steps or by progressive injection of currents (Fig. 1\n,) with a threshold of \u221240 \u00b1 0.9 mV. This confirmed their neuronal phenotype. Interestingly, most of the ectopic cells (68%, 17 of 25 cells) (Fig. 1\n) generated only few spikes (1\u20134) when they were sufficiently depolarized (transient firing pattern), whereas the others (32%, 8 of 25 cells) (Fig. 1\n) had regular spiking activity at a rate ranging between 5 and 26 Hz. As shown in Table 1, the spike properties [threshold, amplitude, overshoot, half-width, and fast afterhyperpolarization (AHP) amplitude] are significantly different between these two groups of cells. More specifically, the low-firing-pattern group generates spikes at a more depolarized membrane potential than the sustained-firing-pattern group. In addition, the amplitude of the spikes and of the fast AHP are smaller, the half-width is larger, and there is only a small spike overshoot in the low-firing-pattern group, showing that the spikes are less mature in this group. In contrast to the spike properties, the resting membrane potentials, input resistance, cell capacitance, and synaptic properties were not significantly different between the two groups of cells. Together these results indicate that heterotopias are composed of a heterogenous population of neurons at least in term of their firing properties.  reconstruction of recorded neurons injected with biocytin revealed that the majority of transfected ectopic neurons displayed a bipolar or multipolar shape with the majority of their dendrites acquiring a tangential orientation (Figs. 1\n, 2). Axonal branches left the heterotopia and traveled along the corpus callosum (Fig. 2; supplemental Movie S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). All recorded neurons displayed axon collaterals that reached upper L4\u20135 (Fig. 2). In addition, we were able to detect in 18% (4 of 22 cells) of reconstructed neurons the presence of axonal collaterals coursing through the external capsule and into the striatum (Fig. 2\n; supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Biocytin filling of ectopic neurons also resulted in a 53% increase in numbers of extra neurons labeled in the white matter or within L6 (1.5 extra neurons per slice;  = 11 slices). Labeling of clusters of neurons after single fills has been reported previously for neocortical neurons at this age and has been attributed to biocytin diffusion through gap junctions (Peinado et al., 1993), which provide a mechanism for electrotonic coupling and transmission of immature intrinsic activities within networks. In addition, we found extra callosally projecting axons labeled in our slices that were assessed via confocal optical sectioning to have not stemmed from biocytin-labeled somas (Fig. 2\n; supplemental Movie S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). The presence of multiple points of juxtaposition with axons stemming from patched neurons suggests that these extra axons could have been labeled via axon\u2013axon gap junctions as has been found between axons in the normal hippocampus (Hamzei-Sichani et al., 2007).Physiological properties of GFP+ ectopic neuronsAxonal arborizations of ectopic cortical neurons. \n\n, Reconstructions of biocytin-filled ectopic neurons. EGFP+ ectopic neurons were targeted for whole-cell recordings with biocytin-containing patch pipettes. Axonal arbors emanating from different neurons are colored (orange, blue, and magenta). Notice axons from ectopic neurons coursing callosally and ventrally within the white matter. Scale bar, 200 \u03bcm. \n\n, Additional examples of ectopic neurons. Axonal arbors from the two patched neurons in this slice are colored (blue and magenta). Notice axonal collaterals coursing within the white matter, cortex, and striatum/internal capsule. Also notice two biocytin-filled axons in the callosum (black, arrows 3, 4) that did not emanate from the patched neurons (also see supplemental Movie S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). \n\n, Enlargement of drawings shown in \n\n; inset displays the corresponding confocal picture. Arrows depict patched neurons double stained with EGFP and Cy3; arrowheads point to nonpatched but biocytin-positive neurons: they are transfected or nontransfected cells, the latter likely retained within the heterotopia by a cell-population effect as described previously (Ramos et al., 2006). Scale bars: 200 \u03bcm; (inset) 50 \u03bcm. c.c., Corpus callosum; e.c., external capsule; i.c., internal capsule; str, striatum.In experimental L2/3 overlying the heterotopia, biocytin-filled neurons had a normal pyramidal morphology with apical radially oriented dendrites (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Their axon emerged from the basal part of the cell body or basal dendrites and reached the corpus callosum at the level of the heterotopia. In 8 of 12 reconstructed neurons, axonal collateral branches were observed to distribute within the heterotopia. None of reconstructed neurons from experimental L2/3 neurons displayed axons reaching the striatum. Extra neurons were also labeled within L2/3 in 4 of 9 experimental slices (supplemental Fig. 2,, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).In control L2/3 [contL2/3; EGFP ( = 3 animals)]- or mismatch ( = 2 animals)-transfected animals, EGFP-positive neurons localized mainly on L2/3 as expected (Fig. 1\n,; supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). All transfected or nontransfected neurons, as well as biocytin-filled cells, displayed typical pyramidal cell morphology.To evaluate the presence and distribution of glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals, we labeled cortical sections from control and DCX RNAi-injected rats with antibodies against vGlut1 and GAD 65/67, respectively. Both control (Fig. 3\n,) and DCX RNAi L2/3 (Fig. 3\n,) displayed typical GAD- and vGlut1-stained puncta, which were virtually absent from the corpus callosum (Fig. 3\n,). The heterotopias themselves also displayed positive staining for both antibodies (Fig. 3\n,); puncta staining was observed surrounding EGFP ectopic neurons (Fig. 3\n). Semiquantitative analysis of stained sections did not reveal major differences on the density of puncta in experimental compared with control L2/3 (Fig. 3\n,): the heterotopia contained a similar density of GAD-positive puncta but a significantly lower density of vGlut1-immunoreactive terminals than control L2/3. Therefore, neurons in the heterotopia were in close contact with glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals and can be integrated within cortical networks.Distribution of GABAergic and glutamatergic terminals in DCX animals. \n\n, Immunostaining with GAD65/67 (left panels) and vGlut1 (right panels) antibodies of cortical sections. Pictures were taken from representative control L2/3 (\n\n, \n\n), experimental L2/3 (\n\n, \n\n), control corpus callosum (\n\n, \n\n), and white matter heterotopia (\n\n, \n\n). Color pictures (\n\n) illustrate the presence of GABA (\n\n) and glutamate (\n\n) terminals (in red) around cell bodies and dendrites (in green) of ectopic neurons. Insets in \n\n and \n\n are enlarged in \n\n and \n\n, respectively; the contours of somatodendritic elements of green cells were delineated in \n\n and \n\n for a better appreciation of the distribution of immunopositive elements. \n\n, Bar graphs depict GAD immunoreactivity levels on the different fields. \n\n, Bar graphs depict vGlut1 immunoreactivity levels on the different fields. Notice that vGlut1 immunoreactivity in heterotopia is significantly lower than in control L2/3 and DCX L2/3 (mean values of 4\u20136 animals \u00b1 SEM; * = 0.005,  test). Scale bars, 10 \u03bcm.Calcium imaging of neuronal networks enables quantitative estimates of the activity of a large number of neurons within a cortical field and assessment of specific activity patterns in neuronal assemblies (Cr\u00e9pel et al., 2007). This approach allows the investigation of neuronal firing dependent on sodium action potentials (sensitive to TTX; see below) (Cr\u00e9pel et al., 2007; Goldin et al., 2007). We applied this approach to animals displaying band heterotopia after DCX RNAi (Fig. 4; supplemental Movie S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Neurons recorded from heterotopic (2272 cells, 28 movies, 16 slices), experimental L2/3 (4070 cells, 20 movies, 14 slices), and control L2/3 (4847 cells, 26 movies, 17 slices) fields were spontaneously active (Table 2; supplemental Movie S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Recorded calcium transients had the following mean half-rise times: heterotopia, 0.62 \u00b1 0.03 s,  = 1464 events; expL2/3, 0.40 \u00b1 0.02 s,  = 4862 events; contL2/3, 0.56 \u00b1 0.02 s,  = 2060 events. Interestingly, we observed that heterotopic and experimental L2/3 networks exhibited significantly higher percentages of active cells than control L2/3 (mean percentage active were as follows: het, 19.3 \u00b1 2.8%; expL2/3, 16.2 \u00b1 3.2%; contL2/3, 9.7 \u00b1 1.5%;  = 0.0389, Kruskal\u2013Wallis test) (Table 2, Fig. 4\n).Spontaneous activity in heterotopic networks during postnatal development. \n\n, Identification and calcium indicator loading of the heterotopic network. An EGFP+ heterotopia was identified in a coronal slice from a P3 rat and loaded with the calcium indicator fura-2 AM. Shown are single -sections of the EGFP and fura-2 signals under two-photon excitation (middle). Contour outlines of the fura-2-loaded somas are shown in the right panel. Filled contours (gray) indicate neurons displaying spontaneous calcium transients during a 100 s optical recording. EGFP+ neurons are indicated with green outlines. Scale bars, 50 \u03bcm. c.c., Corpus callosum. \n\n, Examples of calcium fluorescence traces from neurons in the control L2/3, experimental cortex L2/3, and heterotopia. Top and bottom traces are examples of two different cells from recordings in each network. \n\n, Synaptic (top)- and nonsynaptic (bottom)-mediated activity in L2/3 experimental and heterotopic networks, respectively. The example recordings of L2/3 experimental and ectopic neurons are from the same slice of a P10 animal. Traces represent the same cells monitored before and after drug application. Longer-duration nonsynaptic-type calcium events persist in the presence of glutamatergic and GABAergic antagonists (NBQX/APV/BIC) but are sensitive to TTX (top traces) in the heterotopia in contrast to shorter-duration synaptically driven transients (bottom traces) recorded in experimental L2/3. \n\n, Strip plots of the percentage of active cells in control L2/3, experimental L2/3, and heterotopic networks in control conditions (ACSF) or in the presence of glutamate receptor antagonists NBQX and APV or glutamate receptor antagonists plus GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (nbqx.apv.bic) or TTX. Gray circles represent the percentage of active cells per slice. Means and \u00b11 SEM are represented by black boxes. * < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum. \n\n, Bar plot summarizing the average signal power (integrated spectral power) for all active cells on the interval [0, 3.5 Hz]. *** < 0.0001, pairwise  test. contL2/3,  = 222 cells; expL2/3,  = 521; het,  = 441.Network activities of control L2/3, experimental L2/3, and heterotopia measured by population calcium imagingWe next used spectral analysis to determine power of oscillatory signals in our raw time series data from active cells. We found increased total average power at detectable signal frequencies (0\u20133.5 Hz) in experimental L2/3 with respect to the heterotopic or control L2/3 networks (het, 0.0040 \u00b1 0.0005 dB,  = 441 cells; exp L2/3, 0.0109 \u00b1 0.0015 dB,  = 521 cells; contL2/3, 0.0032 \u00b1 0.0005 dB,  = 222 cells;  < 0.0001, ANOVA) (Fig. 4\n; supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Manual detection of individual calcium transients in active cells confirmed that experimental L2/3 neurons exhibited higher spontaneous event frequencies than control L2/3 networks (expL2/3, 0.06 \u00b1 0.004 Hz,  = 521 cells; contL2/3, 0.030 \u00b1 0.003 Hz,  = 222 cells;  < 0.0001) (Table 2). In addition, the frequency of spontaneous events exhibited by active heterotopic neurons was lower than that exhibited by control neurons (het, 0.02 \u00b1 0.002 Hz,  = 441 cells;  < 0.0001).Next we looked at the contribution of glutamatergic and GABAergic receptor-mediated activities to the spontaneous activity (percentage of active cells and average event frequency of individual active cells). We found that experimental L2/3 and control L2/3 networks exhibited reduced spontaneous activity in the presence of the ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists (NBQX and APV) and the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (Table 2, Fig. 4\n). Thus, in experimental L2/3, combined application of glutamatergic and GABAergic antagonists reduced the number of active neurons by 62% ( = 0.0212, Wilcoxon rank sum test) and the frequency of recorded events by 89% ( < 0.0001, pairwise  test); these drugs reduced in control L2/3 the number of active neurons by 48% ( = 0.0360) and the number of recorded events by 81% ( < 0.0001). In contrast, receptor antagonists failed to reduce the number of active heterotopic neurons ( = 0.7969, Wilcoxon rank sum) that maintained a positive median event frequency under glutamatergic and GABAergic antagonists (0.0054 Hz), whereas in experimental and control L2/3, the median frequency under antagonists was zero (supplemental Fig. 3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). The presence of TTX greatly diminished spontaneous event frequencies in cells from all networks: 87.58% reduction in control L2/3 ( < 0.0001, pairwise  test), 99.26% reduction in experimental L2/3 ( < 0.0001), and 95.89% reduction in heterotopic neurons ( < 0.0001) (Fig. 4\n,).Together these observations support the notion that ectopic neurons display relatively low levels of spontaneous synaptic receptor-mediated activity with a predominance of intrinsic voltage-gated TTX-sensitive currents. This pattern is reminiscent of that observed in immature neurons (Cr\u00e9pel et al., 2007). These results support a less mature, nonsynaptic network activity for heterotopic networks at ages when adjacent neocortical layers are displaying more mature, synaptically driven activity. Conversely, these data reveal that experimental L2/3 neurons overlying the heterotopia display increased frequencies of synaptically mediated activities compared with control L2/3 cells.We next looked at the dynamics of population activity in heterotopic and experimental L2/3 networks in the second postnatal week. The analysis of the percentage of coactive cells (the highest percentage of cells active at a time in a movie) (Table 2, Fig. 5\n) indicates that heterotopic and experimental L2/3 networks present a twofold increase in population coactivity with respect to control L2/3 networks ( = 0.01003, Kruskal\u2013Wallis). Next we randomized the event onset timings for each recording to find significantly correlated population events. Experimental L2/3 and heterotopic networks exhibited significantly higher percentages of cells involved in correlations than control (expL2/3, 13.9 \u00b1 3.3%; het, 14.7 \u00b1 2.8%; contL2/3, 7.3 \u00b1 1.6%;  = 0.0305 and  = 0.0479, Wilcoxon rank sum) (Table 2). Representing significant correlations as a percentage of all possible pair combinations in each network affirmed an increased population coherence in experimental cortex and heterotopia with respect to control L2/3 (expL2/3, 2.60 \u00b1 2.00%; het, 3.31 \u00b1 1.38%; contL2/3, 0.74 \u00b1 0.39%;  = 0.0409 and  = 0.0235, Wilcoxon rank sum) (Table 2).Correlated population events within the heterotopic and experimental L2/3 networks. \n\n, Event duration histogram (top) and raster plot (bottom) from optical recordings of control L2/3 (left), experimental L2/3 (middle), and heterotopia from the same experimental slice (right). Histograms depict the percentage of imaged cells that are detected as being active at each movie frame, and raster plots indicate for each recorded neuron the times at which it displays calcium transients and their durations (horizontal lines). Experimental L2/3 and heterotopic networks have a significant increase in cells participating in correlated spontaneous calcium events with respect to the control L2/3 network. \n\n, Population coherence in heterotopic and experimental L2/3 networks. Each circle represents the percentage of correlated cells within and during an optical recording. Means and \u00b11 SEM are represented by black boxes. Although the application of receptor antagonists significantly reduced the neuronal correlation in experimental L2/3, it failed to induce any significant change in the heterotopia. ** < 0.0078, Wilcoxon rank sum.These results indicate that experimental L2/3 networks overlying heterotopia exhibit increased amounts of spontaneous and correlated network activities with respect to control L2/3. Individual ectopic neurons displayed decreased spontaneous event frequencies compared with control L2/3 (Table 2; supplemental Fig. 3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), but a greater percentage of cells within the heterotopic network are apt to exhibit spontaneous correlated events in a given period of time (Table 2, Fig. 5).Glutamate and GABA receptor antagonists significantly reduced (Table 2, Fig. 5\n) coherent network activities in experimental L2/3; they decreased the peak percentage of coactive network activity by 73% and the percentage of correlated cells by 86% ( = 0.0094, Wilcoxon rank sum). In contrast, the presence of glutamate and GABA receptor antagonists did not significantly reduce correlated events in the heterotopia ( = 0.7912, Wilcoxon rank sum).Together these results suggest that in DCX cortex, experimental L2/3 displays a higher number of active neurons, higher frequencies of synaptic events, and higher incidence of synaptic synchronization than control L2/3. In contrast, ectopic neurons display decreased levels of synaptic activity, although they display increased amounts of correlated, nonsynaptic network activities.To gain more insights at the cellular level into the synaptic properties of dysplastic cortex, we performed patch-clamp recordings of spontaneous GABAergic IPSCs (sIPSCs) and glutamatergic EPSCs (sEPSCs) in the three neuronal populations: ectopic, experimental L2/3, and control L2/3 neurons (untransfected or DCX mismatch RNAi- and EGFP-transfected neurons). Glutamate-mediated postsynaptic currents were measured either at approximately \u221270 mV (\nCl\n\u2212; only glutamatergic PSCs can be recorded) or at \u221240 mV (GABA PSCs are outward, whereas glutamate events are inward) (Fig. 6). These events were respectively abolished by bicuculline (20 \u03bcm) and NBQX/d-APV (10/40 \u03bcm) (data not shown).Spontaneous synaptic activity in heterotopia is dominated by glutamate. \n\n, Example traces of ongoing spontaneous activity recorded at \u221270 mV (Cl\u2212) and \u221240 mV in a pyramidal cell of control L2/3 (left traces), experimental L2/3 (middle traces), and white matter heterotopia (right traces). Note the large increase of glutamate PSCs in the pyramidal cell from experimental L2/3 compared with control. Note in the ectopic cell the low level of activity and the absence of GABA PSCs. \n\n, Mean GABA (\n\n) and glutamate (Glu; \n\n) PSC frequencies in L2/3 pyramidal neurons from control, mismatch (Mism), and DCX slices, and in ectopic cells. The numbers of recorded cells are given in parentheses. \n\n, Glutamate/GABA PSC frequency ratio in the first three populations of cells. Values indicated in the histogram correspond to the mean of the ratio of Glu to GABA PSC frequency of each individual cell (the number of cells is given in parentheses). Note that the ongoing spontaneous activity in pyramidal cell from experimental L2/3 is largely dominated by glutamate. Most of the ectopic neurons (73%) lack GABA events, but the 15 displaying both GABA and glutamate PSC presented a mean Glu/GABA PSC frequency ratio of 1.8 \u00b1 0.6. \n\n, Histogram representing the EPSC size distribution in pyramidal cells recorded in control layer 2/3 (837 events,  = 3), experimental layer 2/3 (837 events,  = 4), and heterotopia (817 events,  = 7). Nb, Number. *Significantly different as compared to Cont.L2/3 or Mism.L2/3.Experimental L2/3 neurons exhibited an approximately fourfold increase in sEPSC frequencies with respect to control L2/3 neurons (expL2/3, 7.94 \u00b1 1.9 Hz,  = 14 cells; contL2/3, 2.02 \u00b1 0.8 Hz,  = 10 cells;  = 0.0215) (Fig. 6\n,) without significant change of their kinetics properties and amplitudes (Table 3, Fig. 6\n). In experimental L2/3, there was no significant change in sIPSC frequency (Table 3), but the ratio of glutamatergic/GABAergic events was \u223c11 times higher than in control L2/3 (Fig. 6\n). Cortical L2/3 neurons from animals injected with mismatch constructs (see Materials and Methods) displayed a frequency of EPSCs and IPSCs similar to that of control L2/3 neurons (Table 3). In addition, the glutamatergic/GABAergic events ratio (\u223c1) was unaffected (Fig. 6\n). Therefore, we propose that the development of white matter heterotopia in DCX animals results in a dramatic alteration in overlying cortex toward increased glutamatergic drive.Synaptic properties of recorded neurons from control (untransfected or mismatch transfected) and DCX cortex (experimental L2/3 or heterotopia)EGFP ectopic neurons located in the white matter or in layer 6 exhibited a drastic decrease in the frequency of spontaneous synaptic activities with respect to control L2/3 cells and experimental L2/3 (Fig. 6\n): mean frequencies of IPSCs and EPSCs in the heterotopia were 0.03 \u00b1 0.001 and 0.23 \u00b1 0.04 ( < 0.0001), respectively, without significant changes of both amplitudes and kinetics of the events (Table 3, Fig. 6\n). Furthermore the events in the heterotopia were mostly mediated by glutamate. Thus, glutamate PSCs were observed in 85% of the recorded cells (46/54 cells), but GABA PSCs were observed in only 27% of them (15/54). Up to 15% of recorded neurons (8/54) displayed no synaptic activities. To further stress the absence of IPSCs, we analyzed the effects of electrical stimulations of different cortical areas and white matter, which consistently evoked a response in ectopic neurons that was mediated by glutamate ( = 7/8): the response was always inward at membrane potentials more positive than \u221270 mV, reversed polarity around 0 mV, and was fully blocked by ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists (10 \u03bcm NBQX and 40 \u03bcm\nd-APV). In one cell, the stimulation failed to evoke any response. Electrical stimulation of the deep layers also evoked a response in 7 of 9 ectopic cells, a response that was mediated by glutamate. No response were evoked in 2 of 9 cells. Finally, the stimulation of layer 2/3 evoked a response mediated by glutamate in 15 of 32 ectopic cells, a response mediated by both GABA and glutamate in 1 cell and no response at all in 16 cells.Together these data suggest that most neurons in the heterotopia display a reduced synaptic activity and lack functional GABAA synapses. To determine whether this also applied to deep cortical neurons close to the heterotopia, we simultaneously recorded EGFP-positive cells within the heterotopia or layer 6 and EGFP-negative layer 6 neurons (Fig. 7\n). Whereas the fluorescent ectopic neurons displayed spontaneous PSCs and PSCs evoked by electrical stimulation mediated only by glutamate (Fig. 7\n), the non-EGFP cells had PSCs mediated by both glutamate and GABAA receptors (Fig. 7\n). Similar results were obtained in 12 EGFP-negative L6 cells; i.e., spontaneous PSCs and PSCs evoked by stimulation of either superficial layer ( = 3/3) or deep cortical layer ( = 7/7) consisted of GABA and glutamate events. To determine whether ectopic cells have functional GABAA receptors, isoguvacine (30 \u03bcm), a specific agonist of GABAA receptor, was pressure ejected for 1 s (Fig. 7\n). In all recorded neurons, this evoked a current reversing at \nCl\n\u2212, thus indicating the presence of GABAA receptors in ectopic and nonectopic neurons. However, in ectopic neurons the amplitude of the evoked currents (expressed in picoamperes per picofarad) was significantly lower than in EGFP-negative neighbor L6 neurons (0.99 \u00b1 0.27 pA/pF and 4.3 \u00b1 0.8 pA/pF in heterotopic neurons and EGFP-negative neighbor L6 neurons, respectively;  < 10\u22125). A significantly reduced current was also observed when ectopic cells were compared with experimental layer 2/3 cells (3.1 \u00b1 0.6 pA/pF;  < 0.004). Therefore, ectopic neurons display in 2-week-old animals a reduced glutamatergic synaptic drive and a drastic deficit in postsynaptic GABAergic signaling. We wonder whether the lack of functional GABAergic synapses in ectopic cells might be caused by retardation in their establishment. We thus recorded ectopic cells in older animals (1 month old) and found in 7 of 9 cells the presence of spontaneous GABAergic events in addition to glutamatergic events and in two cells the presence of glutamatergic events only. The mean frequencies of GABAergic and glutamatergic PSCs were 1.5 \u00b1 0.7 Hz and 0.83 \u00b1 0.24 Hz, respectively ( = 9); glutamatergic/GABAergic events ratio was 1.13 \u00b1 0.5 ( = 7). Interestingly, kinetic properties of GABAergic and glutamate PSCs were not significantly different from those measured in 2-week-old animals; for GABAergic PSCs, the mean rise time, decay time constant, and amplitude were 1.5 \u00b1 0.2 ms, 15.2 \u00b1 2.5 ms, and 13.4 \u00b1 0.8 pA, respectively ( = 7); for glutamatergic PSCs, the mean rise time, decay time constant, and amplitude were 1.1 \u00b1 0.12 ms, 5.4 \u00b1 0.6 ms, and 10 \u00b1 0.8 pA, respectively ( = 9).Lack of functional GABA synapses in ectopic cells. \n\n, Confocal image of two biocytin-injected (red) patch-clamp-recorded neurons from experimental L6.

Note that the responses are always inward at potentials more positive than \u221270 mV, indicating that they are mediated only by glutamate (even higher stimulus intensity, up to 100 V, failed to evoke any outward current at these membrane potentials). \n\n, Currents evoked in the same cell by pressure ejection of isoguvacine (30 \u03bcm, 1 s, 1 psi) at different membrane potentials. Note that these currents are lower than in a normotopic cell. \n\n, Mean current amplitude evoked by pressure ejection of isoguvacine (30 \u03bcm, 1 s) at \u221240 mV expressed in picoamperes per picofarad in ectopic L6 neurons (mean capacitance: 33 \u00b1 2 pF), nonectopic L6 neurons (experimental L6, mean capacitance: 59 \u00b1 10 pF), and experimental L2/3 neurons (mean capacitance: 35 \u00b1 6 pF). Note that ectopic cells display 3\u20134 times less currents than nonectopic cells, which display functional GABA synapses. Whole-cell pipettes were filled with a CsGlu internal solution. * < 0.004.All in all, these data clearly show that experimental L2/3 neurons exhibit a strong enhancement of synaptic glutamatergic drive with no change in GABAergic synaptic transmission, whereas ectopic neurons display retardation in the establishment of functional GABAergic signaling.Patch-clamp recordings have revealed that L2/3 cells overlying the heterotopia display an enhanced glutamatergic synaptic drive that leads to a drastic increase of neuronal activity. Therefore, we reasoned that this hyperexcitability could favor the generation of spontaneous network synchronized activities; accordingly, increased percentage of neurotransmitter-mediated correlated calcium events have been observed using calcium imaging (Fig. 5). To test this hypothesis, extracellular field recordings were performed in experimental L2/3 cells overlying the heterotopia and compared with control L2/3 neurons (Fig. 8).Ectopic neurons participate in cortical network activity. \n\n, Concomitant field potential (F.P.) recording of experimental L2/3 and patch-clamp recording of an ectopic cell at \u221240 mV holding potential. A single electrical stimulation of L2/3 (40 V, 30 \u03bcs) evokes responses that are blocked by ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists (NBQX, 10 \u03bcm; d-APV, 40 \u03bcm). The remaining population spike in the field is blocked by TTX (1 \u03bcm). \n\n, Coincident spontaneous recurrent activities recorded in experimental L2/3 (field potential) and an ectopic neuron (patch clamp at a holding potential of \u221240 mV).

One burst is shown at a higher time scale below the continuous trace, and one of the events in the burst (marked with an asterisk) is shown at an expanded time scale on the right. Note that the onset of the field potential in L2/3 (labeled with a dashed line) starts before the onset of the ectopic cell. \n\n, Histogram representing the difference in the latency of the onset of the field and of the PSCs of each event within the burst. Note that for almost half of the events, the onset of the field starts at the same time as the PSCs, whereas in the majority of events, L2/3 is active before the ectopic cell. The ectopic cell is active before the field (negative latency) in only a few cases. Nb, Number.We observed that in normal ACSF (3.5 mm K+) (Fig. 8\n) or in ACSF containing 5 mm K+, 40% (4 of 10 slices) and 75% of experimental L2/3 (6 of 8 slices), respectively, displayed spontaneous network events that were fully abolished by glutamatergic receptor antagonist (10 \u03bcm NBQX, 40 \u03bcm\nd-APV, data not shown). In contrast, control L2/3 neurons did not display spontaneous activities in normal ACSF or in ACSF containing 5 mm K+. Therefore, L2/3 dysplastic cortex is more susceptible to generate glutamatergic spontaneous network-driven activities. A simultaneous patch-clamp recording of ectopic cells and L2/3 field (performed in normal ACSF) revealed the presence of coincident glutamatergic spontaneous network-driven activities (Fig. 8\n). In addition, the stimulation of cortical L2/3 or white matter ( = 10) (Fig. 8\n) evoked synaptic responses in ectopic cells, and this was always coincident with a field response in the layer 2/3, both responses being blocked by glutamate receptors antagonists. These data indicate that heterotopic and L2/3 networks may work together via glutamate pathway to generate coherent activities.Next we assessed whether the dysplastic cortex is capable of supporting the generation of epileptiform activities. To this aim, slices were superfused with a Mg2+-free ACSF solution, and ectopic neurons (patch clamp) and L2/3 overlying the heterotopia (field recordings) were simultaneously recorded. This condition elicited synchronous epileptiform discharges in experimental L2/3 (Fig. 8\n) in five slices tested. In three slices, bursts were also observed in the heterotopia, which were concomitant with those recorded in L2/3, but experimental L2/3 exhibited more interburst activity than ectopic neurons. These activities were mediated by glutamate, because they were blocked by 10 \u03bcm NBQX and 40 \u03bcm APV (data not shown). Interestingly, experimental cortex was activated either at the same time or before ectopic neurons (in 33 of 82 bursts and 43 of 82 bursts, respectively) (Fig. 8\n). In a minority of cases (6 of 82 bursts), ectopic neurons were activated before the experimental layer. This strongly suggests that the epileptiform discharges do not start from the heterotopia, and transit preferentially through experimental L2/3 neurons. Moreover, these data also show that ectopic neurons are integrated in the cortical network and may participate in the development of pathological activity together with L2/3 neurons.The presence of cortical malformations in many patients with intractable childhood epilepsy underscores the importance of understanding the basis of aberrant communication in dysplastic networks. Here, using fast calcium imaging and targeted cell recordings, we provide the first report of the development network properties in a modeled human genetic neocortical malformation. We show that ectopic neurons display a delayed maturation of functional GABAergic synapses though they generate voltage-gated synchronized oscillatory currents. Neocortex overlying the heterotopia exhibits a synaptic remodeling/plasticity leading to increased excitability through enhanced glutamatergic synaptic drive. The convergence of these features may facilitate the generation of coherent pathologic oscillations. Ectopic neurons are integrated within the same network as overlying cortex and are coactivated during epileptiform bursts in low-magnesium media. These results suggest that migration disorders produce major alterations not only in neurons that fail to migrate but also in their programmed target areas.During the second postnatal week, neurons in the heterotopia, unlike control or experimental L2/3 neurons, display in calcium imaging analysis coherent calcium events insensitive to glutamate and GABA receptor antagonists and blocked by TTX. This type of activity is reminiscent of previous observations depicting in maturing hippocampus, around birth, small cell assemblies that generate synchronous nonsynaptic calcium oscillations via gap junctions; this type of activity being progressively shut down during maturation by the emergence of synapse-driven activity (Cr\u00e9pel et al., 2007). Accordingly, we found additional biocytin-filled axons in our reconstruction experiments of ectopic neurons that could not have come from other filled neurons in the slices and (Fig. 2; supplemental Movie S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material); these data indicate that ectopic neurons presumably form gap junctions with other callosally projecting neurons. Interestingly, previous theoretical and experimental work has indicated a role for axo-axonic gap junctions in the generation of high frequency oscillations (Schmitz et al., 2001; Traub et al., 2001). Future studies may clarify the prevalence of axo-axonic gap junctions in malformed neocortical neurons. These observations lead us to propose that neurons in an unfavorable ectopic location retain functional immature status compared with normally positioned neurons. In keeping with this, patch-clamp recordings show that the majority of ectopic neurons generate spikes with immature properties (half-width and amplitude) and exhibit a reduced number of glutamatergic synaptic events and a dramatic loss of GABAergic synaptic drive compared with control L2/3 neurons during the second postnatal week. A reduction of sIPSC frequencies was previously shown in intrahippocampal heterotopia in rats treated with methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM rats) (Calcagnotto et al., 2002, 2005) or in white matter heterotopia in rats that have been exposed to  gamma irradiation (Zhu and Roper, 2000; Chen and Roper, 2003). However, at the second postnatal week, DCX heterotopias display a more severe phenotype: most neurons did not display any GABA synaptic event. This severe lack of GABAergic signaling in DCX heterotopia is not a consequence of presynaptic deficiencies, because the heterotopia contains different types of GABA interneurons (Ramos et al., 2006) and ectopic neurons are surrounded by numerous GAD65/67-positive terminals. Recordings of older animals reveal that the lack of GABAergic activity during the second postnatal week in ectopic cells results from a delay in the establishment of functional synapses. Indeed, ectopic cells from 1-month-old animals exhibit a well developed GABAergic synaptic transmission reaching the level of the glutamatergic one. Preliminary experiments on cultured cortical neurons also show that DCX knockdown neurons acquire functional GABA synapses in a way similar to neurons transfected with mismatch constructs used as control (L. Aniksztejn, E. Becq, and A. Represa, unpublished observations). Therefore, there is an important delay in the maturation of GABAergic signaling that is most likely the consequence of the abnormal position/environment of ectopic neurons (white matter/deep cortical layers instead of L2/3). Previous experiments performed in the neonatal hippocampus and neocortex have provided evidence that GABAergic synapses are established before glutamatergic synapses (Tyzio et al., 1999; Hennou et al., 2002; Owens and Kriegstein, 2002; Ge et al., 2006; Wang and Kriegstein, 2008). Furthermore, a recent study has demonstrated that GABAergic activity is necessary for the formation of functional glutamatergic synapses (Wang and Kriegstein, 2008). Interestingly, our results show that ectopic cells display glutamatergic activity before GABAergic activity, indicating that this rule may not apply for misplaced neurons, although we cannot exclude that, once established, GABAergic activity accelerates the formation of glutamatergic synapses.Calcium imaging in experimental L2/3 cortex revealed a significant increase in the number of synaptically active neurons and the number and frequency of events recorded. In agreement with this, patch-clamp recordings indicate a clear increase in the number of glutamate-mediated synaptic events with no apparent change on the GABAergic drive in experimental L2/3 compared with untransfected or mismatch-transfected L2/3 pyramids. This leads to a dramatic shift of the glutamate/GABA ratio toward excitation. Our data show that the density of vGlut1-immunoreactive terminals is not modified compared with controls and that the kinetics and amplitude of the synaptic events recorded were similar to control slices. Therefore we propose that the increased frequency of glutamate-mediated synaptic events on experimental L2/3 neurons might result from an increased probability of glutamate release or firing of glutamatergic cells innervating L2/3 neurons. Interestingly, our calcium imaging analysis indicates that compared with control, higher numbers of experimental L2/3 neurons are active at higher frequency rates, suggesting that a corticocortical loop is involved in this alteration.Previous investigations in telencephalic internal structural heterotopia (TISH) rats also concluded in an increased excitability of \u201cexperimental\u201d cortex overlying the heterotopia but linked to a decrease in the GABAergic drive (Trotter et al., 2006). In fact, in TISH as in irradiated rats (Xiang et al., 2006), the population of GABAergic neurons is directly affected. In contrast, DCX RNAi rats present a quite normal upper layer organization. In this apparently \u201cnormal\u201d cortex, the density of GABA neurons (Ramos et al., 2006) and GABA synaptic terminals (Fig. 3) and the features of recorded GABA synaptic events were similar to that of controls. On the other hand, it has been proposed that synaptic remodeling induced by different types of insults can lead to the emergence of epilepsy (e.g., Li and Prince, 2002; Jin et al., 2006). For example, layer V pyramidal cells in isolated cortex receive an excitatory synaptic input that is increased in spatial extent and intensity and is derived principally from presynaptic neurons (Jin et al., 2006). Our present results depicting an increased excitatory input to layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons may therefore result from a similar mechanism. The increased excitability in DCX experimental cortex resulting from a heightened glutamatergic drive to pyramidal neurons would be the combined product of heterotopia formation and deep layer circuit alterations and the subsequent remodeling of cortical networks.Previous work has demonstrated that the majority of corticostriatal fibers originate from L5 (Levesque et al., 1996). Analyses of MAM, x-ray-irradiated, and TISH rats have revealed that misplaced layer 5 neurons develop subcortical efferent connections, such as callosal (Yurkewicz et al., 1984) and corticospinal (Jensen and Killackey, 1984), and that they may possibly contact thalamic nuclei and striatum (Schottler et al., 1998), thus suggesting that ectopic neurons are able to extend long-range projections and reach the target they would have contacted in a normotopic position. Our analyses indicate that in control pups callosally projecting L2/3 neurons did not send collateral fibers to the striatum. However, a number of ectopic neurons from our experimental pups, initially destined to colonize L2/3, not only exhibit callosal efferents, but also send collaterals that course through the external capsule and into the striatum/internal capsule. Thus, our results suggest that the axonal connectivity of immature neurons is also influenced by positional information, perhaps through transcriptional expression changes such as in satB2 and ctip2, which are associated with neuronal fate respecification and subcortical rewiring (Alcamo et al., 2008; Britanova et al., 2008).We demonstrated using calcium imaging techniques that neurons within the heterotopia and experimental cortex displayed a high level of activity correlation, higher than that observed in control cortex. Interestingly, combined field and patch-clamp recordings of experimental and ectopic neurons demonstrate that activity correlation was also observed between the two fields. Stimulations of cortical afferents evoked synchronous responses in both heterotopia and experimental cortex. In addition, spontaneous coherent network-driven events were recorded both in normal ACSF and low-magnesium conditions.  reconstruction of recorded neurons revealed that axon collaterals from ectopic neurons reach layers 4\u20135 and that L2/3 experimental neurons send collateral branches that course within the heterotopia. Similar to these observations, previous studies on MAM, x-ray-irradiated, and TISH rats depicted the presence of functional cortical\u2013heterotopia connections (for review, see Chevassus-Au-Louis et al., 1999), even when ectopic cortical neurons localize within the hippocampus (Chevassus-Au-Louis et al., 1998); these connections provide a morphological substrate to integrate heterotopia and experimental cortex within the same network. One of the more interesting observations reported here is the activation of experimental cortex earlier than ectopic neurons, indicating that heterotopias are followers rather than initiation centers, in agreement with earlier studies on intrahippocampal heterotopia in MAM rats (Chevassus-Au-Louis et al., 1998) or the band heterotopia of TISH rats (Chen et al., 2000). The band heterotopia may rather act as a relay-projection center to subcortical structures so that activity patterns generated in the experimental L2/3\u2013heterotopic loop would easily be propagated to other brain areas and contribute to neurologic manifestations such as epilepsy and mental retardation.In conclusion, we describe the properties of the cortical network in a relevant experimental model of human subcortical band heterotopia induced by the RNAi of DCX. Our data, obtained during the first postnatal weeks, indicate that upper layer cortical neurons maturing in an ectopic position (the white matter) display abnormal long-lasting immature properties, including a severe delay in the establishment of GABAergic signaling. In addition, we show that the experimental cortex overlying the heterotopia displays reactive-type changes by increasing glutamatergic inputs and the number of synaptically active neurons. Our data also depict that both areas are integrated within the same network. These changes combined with the development of projections from heterotopia to subcortical regions, mainly striatum, will affect the operation and integrative capacities of cortical networks, leading to seizures and alteration of cognitive functions, which are the primary neurological deficits observed in patients with developmental disorders. In a wider context, the analysis of the electrical activity of neuronal ensembles and their programmed target areas in other disorders may provide a better understanding of the relation between genotype and phenotype and how developmental disorders alter cortical operation.This work was supported by Agence nationale de la recherche Grant RPV06055ASA, European Commission contract LSH-CT-2006-037315 (EPICURE) FP6\u2014Thematic priority LIFESCIHEALTH and INSERM.

MORs are coexpressed with neurokinin 1 receptors (NK1Rs) in several regions of the CNS that control opioid dependence and reward. NK1R activation affects opioid reward specifically, however, and the cellular basis for this specificity is unknown. We found that ligand-induced activation of NK1Rs produces a cell-autonomous and nonreciprocal inhibition of MOR endocytosis induced by diverse opioids. Studies using epitope-tagged receptors expressed in cultured striatal neurons and a neuroblastoma cell model indicated that this heterologous regulation is mediated by NK1R-dependent sequestration of arrestins on endosome membranes. First, endocytic inhibition mediated by wild-type NK1Rs was overcome in cells overexpressing \u03b2-arrestin2, a major arrestin isoform expressed in striatum. Second, NK1R activation promoted sequestration of \u03b2-arrestin2 on endosomes, whereas MOR activation did not. Third, heterologous inhibition of MOR endocytosis was prevented by mutational disruption of \u03b2-arrestin2 sequestration by NK1Rs. NK1R-mediated regulation of MOR trafficking was associated with reduced opioid-induced desensitization of adenylyl cyclase signaling in striatal neurons. Furthermore, heterologous regulation of MOR trafficking was observed in both amygdala and locus ceruleus neurons that naturally coexpress these receptors. These results identify a cell-autonomous mechanism that may underlie the highly specific effects of NK1R on opioid signaling and suggest, more generally, that receptor-specific trafficking of arrestins may represent a fundamental mechanism for coordinating distinct GPCR-mediated signals at the level of individual CNS neurons.G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate a wide variety of physiological functions and are the targets of a vast array of both therapeutic and abused drugs. Opioid receptors comprise a subfamily of GPCRs that are activated both by endogenously produced opioid neuropeptides and exogenous alkaloid drugs such as morphine (Evans, 2000). The \u03bc-opioid receptor (MOR) is the primary target mediating analgesic, euphoric, and reinforcing effects of morphine (Matthes et al., 1996). After exposure to opioid peptides, MOR is phosphorylated and associates with \u03b2-arrestin (also called nonvisual arrestin), which modulates opioid signaling and functions as an adaptor protein to promote MOR endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits (Keith et al., 1996; Whistler and von Zastrow, 1998; Zhang et al., 1998; Oakley et al., 1999). This series of events is thought to contribute fundamentally to controlling MOR-mediated signaling under conditions of prolonged or repeated ligand exposure (Koch et al., 1998; Qiu et al., 2003). While morphine promotes relatively little regulated endocytosis of MOR compared with opioid peptides in several cell models, it does strongly produce endocytosis in striatal neurons, a brain region important for reward processing (Heimer et al., 1982; Keith et al., 1998; Whistler et al., 1999; Bushell et al., 2002; Haberstock-Debic et al., 2003, 2005; Trafton and Basbaum, 2004). Therefore, regulated endocytosis of MOR may play an important role in the actions of endogenous MOR in response to both peptides and drugs such as morphine.Whereas MORs are major direct targets receptors of opiate drug action, various other GPCRs modulate opioid function . Of these, the neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) has been found to modulate MOR-dependent responses with a remarkably high degree of specificity. Mice lacking NK1Rs are insensitive to the rewarding properties of morphine, while the rewarding effects of food and cocaine are preserved (Murtra et al., 2000; Ripley et al., 2002). The antinociceptive effects of morphine remain intact in NK1R knock-out animals, further supporting the specificity of NK1R function in modulating opiate reward (De Felipe et al., 1998). Moreover, MORs and NK1Rs are highly expressed in several brain regions relevant to reward processing, including the ventral striatum and amygdala (Pickel et al., 2000; Gadd et al., 2003; Nakaya et al., 1994; Jabourian et al., 2005; Poulin et al., 2006).Given the known physiological interaction between the neurokinin and opioid neurochemical systems, and the coexpression of NK1R and MOR in relevant brain regions, we considered the possibility that these distinct receptor systems might interact functionally at the level of individual neurons. In the present study, we investigated this hypothesis in several cell populations, using both recombinant and natively expressed receptors. Our results identify a cell-autonomous mechanism by which NK1Rs specifically modulate MOR trafficking and signaling, and also suggest a more general principle of heterologous regulation of diverse GPCRs in the CNS.The N-terminally FLAG (DYKDDDD) epitope-tagged murine \u03bc-opioid receptor (F-MOR) was described previously (Keith et al., 1996). The rat NK1 neurokinin receptor (cDNA generously provided by Dr. Nigel Bunnett, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA) was tagged in its N-terminal extracellular domain with an HA (YPYDVPDYA) epitope-tag using PCR (HA-NK1R). Truncation at residue 355 was accomplished by introducing a stop codon using PCR (HA-NK1-355x). Tagged receptor constructs were cloned into pCAGGS (Niwa et al., 1991) for expression in cultured neurons, and pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) for expression in neuroblastoma 2A cells (N2A). A bovine arrestin 3 (\u03b2-arrestin2) construct, tagged with EGFP as described previously (Mundell and Benovic, 2000), was generously provided by Dr. J. Benovic (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Elim Biopharmaceuticals).Primary striatal neurons and primary amygdala neurons were dissected from embryonic day 17\u201318 rat embryos taken from pregnant Sprague Dawley rats. The striatum (caudate\u2013putamen and nucleus accumbens) were dissected based on the criteria of Ventimiglia and Lindsay (1998). The amygdala was identified as described by Altman and Bayer (1995). Dissected tissue was dissociated in 1\u00d7 trypsin/EDTA solution (Invitrogen) for 15 min before 1 ml of trypsin inhibitor was added for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were washed and triturated in DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Invitrogen). Mechanical trituration of tissue was performed using a glass pipette. Neuronal transfections were performed using electroporation (rat neuron nucleofector system; Amaxa Biosystems) immediately after dissociation and plated on poly-l-lysine-coated (1 mg/ml in 0.1 m sodium borate buffer, pH 8.5) glass coverslips washed previously in 70% nitric acid and rinsed over 2\u20133 d. Electroporation was conducted using 5 \u00d7 106 dissociated cells, 3 \u03bcg of plasmid DNA, and 100 \u03bcl of rat neuron nucleofector solution. After transfection, neurons were kept in prewarmed RPMI media (Cell culture facility, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA) for 10 min for recovery before being transferred onto 24-well plates. Media on the cells was replaced with Gibco Neurobasal media (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 (Gibco) and l-glutamine 24 h after transfection. Neurons were maintained 7\u201310 d in culture before assaying.Neuroblastoma 2A cells were obtained from University of San Francisco cell culture facility and maintained in Gibco DMEM (Invitrogen) media supplemented with 10% FCS and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated (50 \u03bcg/ml in water) glass coverslips onto 24-well plates for immunocytochemistry and 6 cm dishes for biotinylation assays. Transfections were performed using a cationic lipid transfection reagent (Effectene; Qiagen). Cells were transfected when they were at 50% confluency and assayed 24 h after transfection.F-MOR and HA-NK1R distribution was visualized after dual immunocytochemical labeling with antibodies recognizing the distinct epitope tags. Rabbit anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (0.2 \u03bcg/ml; Sigma) and mouse anti-HA (5 \u03bcg/ml; Covance) antibodies were added to the culture medium of transfected cells, and surface labeling was performed for 30 min before an additional 30 min incubation in the presence or absence of the indicated ligand(s). After quick washes with either TBS (for neurons) or PBS (for N2A cells), cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in Ca2+-free PBS supplemented with 5% sucrose for 15 min. Specimens were permeabilized and blocked for 20 min in a solution containing either 0.1% saponin (for neurons) or 0.1% Triton X-100 (for N2A cells), and 2% BSA dissolved in the appropriate buffered saline. Secondary labeling was performed using Alexa594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (for F-MOR) and Alexa488 donkey anti-mouse IgG (for HA-NK1R) antibodies (2 \u03bcg/ml; Invitrogen), prepared in the same blocking solution and incubated for 30 min. Cells were then washed extensively with the appropriate buffered saline and mounted onto glass slides for fluorescence microscopy. Epifluorescence microscopy was performed using a Nikon Diaphot microscope equipped with a 60\u00d7/numerical aperture (NA) 1.4 objective, mercury arc lamp illumination and standard dichroic filter sets (Omega Optical). Images were collected with a CCD camera (Princeton Instruments) and analyzed using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). Confocal microscopy was performed with a Zeiss LSM510 instrument, equipped with a 63\u00d7/NA 1.4 objective and using a pinhole diameter of 1 Airy disc.To quantify ligand effects observed with epifluorescence microscopy, we used a previously described assay to assess ratiometric staining of surface and internalized receptors (Haberstock-Debic et al., 2005). In brief, cells were incubated with Alexa594-conjugated M1 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (5 \u03bcg/ml) for 30 min (to selectively label F-MOR present in the plasma membrane) and then incubated in the absence or presence of the indicated ligand(s) for an additional 30 min. Cells were fixed and incubated with Alexa488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG for 30 min under nonpermeabilized conditions (2% BSA in TBS) to selectively detect only those labeled F-MORs remaining at the plasma membrane. Therefore, internalized receptors were labeled with only Alexa594, while surface F-MORs were labeled with both Alexa594 and Alexa488. The percentage of receptor internalization induced by the indicated agonist exposure was calculated from background-subtracted Alexa594 (red) and Alexa488 (green) fluorescence intensity values according to the following formula: percentage internalized = [1 \u2212 (green/red ratio in agonist treated)/(green/red ratio in untreated)] \u00d7 100. For each experiment, 50 neuronal cell bodies or N2A cells were analyzed per condition. Results were compiled from five experiments for each cell type (and four for the N2A truncated HA-NK1R experiments). For experiments in primary cultures, these represented separate animals and culture preparations. Statistical analysis of differences between experimental groups was performed using unpaired Student's  test.Colocalization of HA-NK1R and HA-NK1 355x with \u03b2-arrestin2-EGFP (in both localization and overexpression experiments) was obtained through a similar staining protocol as described above, except that rat anti-HA (5 \u03bcg/ml; Roche) was used as primary antibody and Alexa594-conjugated anti-rat IgG was used as secondary antibody. Triple localization of F-MOR, HA-NK1R, and \u03b2-arrestin2-EGFP was performed using Alexa594 conjugated to M1 anti-FLAG and rat anti-HA primary antibodies, and HA-NK1R was visualized with Alexa647 goat anti-rat secondary antibody. Cells were imaged using the same confocal microscopy settings as described above. For colocalization experiments, control imaging of single-labeled cells was performed to confirm lack of detectable bleed through between channels.For immunocytochemical localization of endogenous receptors, cultured amygdala neurons (grown \u223c7 d in culture on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips) were incubated with the indicated ligand(s) for 30 min followed by a 10 min fixation in ice-cold methanol. Cells were blocked in PBS containing 5% goat serum, 0.3% Tween 20, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 45 min. Staining for endogenous MOR and NK1R was performed using an affinity-purified rabbit antibody recognizing the C terminus of MOR1 (Keith et al., 1998) and a guinea pig antibody recognizing the distinct C terminus of NK1R (1:5000; AB15810, Millipore), respectively. Permeabilized specimens were coincubated with both antibodies at 25\u00b0C for 2.5 h and then extensively washed in PBS after primary incubation. Localization of receptors was visualized after secondary labeling with Alexa594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (for F-MOR) and Alexa488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (for HA-NK1R) antibodies (2 \u03bcg/ml; Invitrogen) prepared in the same blocking solution as above and incubated for 60 min.N2A cells were grown to 50% confluency on 6 cm dishes and transfected with F-MOR and HA-NK1R, or F-MOR and the truncated HA-NK1R (HA-NK1 355x). Transfected cells were washed with cold Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS and then incubated in 0.3 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) in PBS at 4\u00b0C for 20 min. Cells were washed with TBS and placed in DMEM for 10 min at 37\u00b0C before incubation for 30 min under the indicated conditions. Cells were then washed on ice with TBS, to remove and quench residual biotinylation reagent, and remaining cell surface biotinylated receptors were stripped at 4\u00b0C two times for 15 min each using 100 mm MESNA (Sigma-Aldrich) in 50 mm Tris 8.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2% BSA. Stripped cells were then quenched with iodoacetamide buffer (22 mg/ml iodoacetamide in TBS) for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Cells were extracted with lysis buffer containing 1 mg/ml iodoacetamide in IP buffer (0.2% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris 7.4) supplemented with 0.1 mm EDTA and a Complete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (1 tablet/10 ml; Roche). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 \u00d7  for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. Extracts containing equal amounts of cellular protein (determined using Coomassie Plus protein assay from Pierce) were incubated with immobilized streptavidin beads (Pierce) on a rotator overnight at 4\u00b0C. Protein-bound streptavidin beads were centrifuged at 3000 \u00d7  for 1 min at 4\u00b0C and washed twice with IP buffer. Proteins were eluted and denatured in SDS sample buffer with 10% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and separated by SDS/PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and biotinylated proteins were detected by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG M1 mouse antibody (5 \u03bcg/ml; Sigma) followed by anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:5000, Amersham) and chemiluminescence detection using ECL reagent (Amersham).Dissociated striatal neurons were cotransfected with F-MOR and HA-NK1R and maintained for 7\u201310 d in culture before assaying. Before agonist treatment, neurons were incubated in media containing the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, Sigma) at a concentration of 1 mm. To assess acute signaling response, neurons were exposed for 3 min to 3 \u03bcm forskolin and 1 mm IBMX, in the presence 10 \u03bcm morphine, 10 \u03bcm substance P, or both. To assess MOR desensitization, neurons were preincubated in the presence morphine, substance P or both for 30 min. The indicated agonists were then washed out and the ability of neurons to subsequently respond to opiate was assessed by rechallenge for 10 min with 100 nm morphine in the presence of 3 \u03bcm forskolin and 1 mm IBMX. After agonist incubations, cells were immediately washed once with ice-cold PBS before lysing in 0.1 m HCl with 0.1% Triton X-100. Lysates were collected and particulates removed by centrifugation at 1000 \u00d7  for 5 min at room temperature. The concentration of cAMP present in clarified lysates was determined according to the nonacetylated version of the Correlate EIA Direct Cyclic AMP Enzyme Immunoassay Kit protocol (Assay Designs). Acute signaling response was calculated from ligand-induced inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production relative to that measured in cells challenged with forskolin alone. Desensitization was estimated by the decrease in morphine-induced inhibition of cAMP accumulation measured in the rechallenge compared with that measured in cells not previously exposed to opiate. For examination of substance P effects on desensitization, only experiments in which morphine-driven MOR desensitization was reliably detected in the absence of substance P were included in the analysis. In each individual experiment, all manipulations and determinations were performed in triplicate and averaged. The number of independent experiments included in each comparison is indicated in the text. Statistical analyses of differences among experimental conditions were performed using unpaired  test.Four- to six-week-old mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and the brain was removed and sliced horizontally (200 \u03bcm thickness) using a vibratome (Leica) in ice-cold artificial CSF (ACSF) containing the following (in mm): 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 2.4 CaCl2, 21.4 NaHCO3, and 11 glucose as previously described (Arttamangkul et al., 2008). Slices including the locus ceruleus were allowed to warm up to 34\u00b0C in oxygenated ACSF containing (+)-MK-801 (10 \u03bcm, Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min and then incubated in a solution containing Alexa 594-conjugated M1 antibody. The tissue was visualized with an upright microscope (Olympus) equipped with a custom-built two-photon apparatus, as described previously (Arttamangkul et al., 2008). Data were acquired and collected using Scan Image Software (Pologruto et al., 2003). A -series was collected at 1 \u03bcm intervals for 15 \u03bcm. Drugs were applied by perfusion. All experiments were done at 35\u00b0C. Analyses were done off-line using ImageJ (NIH) software as described in detail previously (Arttamangkul et al., 2008). For the control condition, integrated intensity data were obtained from labeled slices before drug application. This fluorescence intensity was defined as total surface-accessible receptor immunoreactivity (). Integrated fluorescence intensity measured after drug perfusion, followed by calcium-free ACSF containing 0.5 mm EGTA (10 min), was defined as internalized receptor immunoreactivity (). Percentage of internalization was calculated by (/) \u00d7 100.To begin to investigate possible regulatory interactions between \u03bc-opioid receptors and neurokinin 1 receptors, we examined the subcellular distribution of receptors when coexpressed in dissociated striatal neurons. Cultured striatal neurons were cotransfected with FLAG-tagged \u03bc-opioid receptors (F-MOR) and HA-tagged neurokinin 1 receptors (HA-NK1R), and the localization of each receptor was examined by dual-label epifluorescence microscopy. In the absence of ligand (untreated condition), antibody-labeled F-MOR was observed in a distribution indicative of plasma membrane localization (Fig. 1, top row, left panel). Similar surface localization was also observed with HA-NK1R (middle panel). The overlay image confirmed an overlap in distribution between F-MOR and HA-NK1R on the plasma membrane (right panel). Examination of the cell body at higher magnification emphasized the overlap in F-MOR and HA-NK1R localization (insets). Exposure of cells to 10 \u03bcm morphine (MS) for 30 min produced a substantial redistribution of labeled F-MOR into a punctate intracellular pattern (Fig. 1, middle row, left panel), consistent with morphine-induced endocytosis of MOR shown previously in these neurons (Haberstock-Debic et al., 2005). In contrast, morphine did not detectably affect the plasma membrane localization of labeled HA-NK1R (middle panel and overlay). Conversely, activating HA-NK1Rs with substance P (SP) resulted in selective internalization of HA-NK1Rs, while F-MORs remained predominantly in the plasma membrane (Fig. 1, bottom row).Morphine and substance P drive redistribution of F-MOR and HA-NK1R selectively in striatal neurons. Dual-labeled epifluorescence micrographs showing F-MOR (red) and HA-NK1R (green) distribution in striatal neurons. Insets within images show a higher-magnification view of a representative region of the cell body (location indicated by box in overlay image). , Incubation with 10 \u03bcm morphine (MS, middle row) or 10 \u03bcm substance P (SP, bottom row) for 30 min produced selective redistribution of F-MOR and HA-NK1R, respectively. , Coincubation with MS and SP prevented F-MOR redistribution while HA-NK1R redistribution was indistinguishable from that exposed to SP alone (top). In neurons transfected with only F-MOR, addition of SP in the media had no effect on F-MOR redistribution in response to MS (bottom). Scale bar, 20 \u03bcm.We next examined the effects of activating both receptors by exposing neurons to morphine and substance P simultaneously. Labeled HA-NK1R redistributed rapidly into a punctate pattern in the combined presence of both agonists, indistinguishable from the redistribution observed in neurons exposed to substance P alone [Fig. 1, compare  (top row) with  (bottom row)]. Surprisingly, F-MORs coexpressed on these same cells remained localized predominantly in the plasma membrane, in contrast to the pronounced redistribution observed in the presence of morphine alone [Fig. 1, compare  (top row) with  (middle row)]. This selective redistribution of HA-NK1R was more clearly evident when viewed at higher magnification (inset). To investigate whether this nonreciprocal inhibition of F-MOR redistribution was dependent on the presence of HA-NK1Rs, we identified cells on the same coverslip expressing only F-MOR and not HA-NK1Rs. In these neurons, incubation with both morphine and substance P produced robust redistribution of F-MOR into a punctate pattern, similar to what was observed with morphine alone (Fig. 1, bottom row). Together, these results show that morphine-induced redistribution of F-MOR in neurons is specifically inhibited by simultaneous activation of coexpressed HA-NK1Rs by substance P.To determine whether the agonist-mediated receptor redistribution observed by immunofluorescence is the result of receptor endocytosis, we used a previously described dual-labeling method to distinguish between surface-localized and internalized MORs (Haberstock-Debic et al., 2005). F-MORs present in the plasma membrane were initially surface-labeled using Alexa594-conjugated anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. After 30 min of ligand incubation, neurons were fixed and receptors remaining in the plasma membrane were selectively labeled with Alexa488-conjugated secondary antibody (Fig. 2, middle column). Internalized receptors appeared red, whereas plasma membrane-localized receptors labeled with both fluorochromes appeared yellow in the overlay image (Fig. 2). Representative images of striatal neurons revealed that a significant fraction of F-MOR present initially in the plasma membrane internalized following exposure of neurons to morphine for 30 min (Fig. 2, top row). In contrast, incubation of neurons with both morphine and substance P resulted in little internalization of F-MOR, demonstrated by an overlap in staining of total receptor and remaining surface receptor (Fig. 2, bottom row). Ratiometric quantification in multiple neurons (as described in Materials and Methods) confirmed the significant inhibitory effect of HA-NK1R activation on regulated endocytosis of F-MOR (Fig. 2, black bars).Regulated endocytosis of F-MOR is inhibited by SP-mediated activation of coexpressed HA-NK1R. Striatal neurons were transfected with F-MOR and HA-NK1R. , Neurons were first incubated with M1-Alexa594 antibody (red) to label surface F-MORs (first column). After 30 min of agonist incubation, neurons were fixed under nonpermeabilizing conditions and incubated with Alexa488 (green) to label remaining F-MORs on the plasma membrane (middle column). Morphine treatment resulted in internalized punctate structures of labeled receptors (top left) that are not accessible to the cell surface (top middle). This is emphasized in the overlay image (top right). In neurons incubated with both MS and SP, total and remaining surface receptor labeling overlapped almost completely, indicating a lack of F-MOR internalization (bottom). , A ratio of green (surface receptors after agonist treatment) to red (total receptor) fluorescence intensity was used to determine percentage F-MOR internalization when incubated with either MS or DAMGO alone, or in combination with SP (see Materials and Methods for detail). Bar graphs represent mean internalization determined from \u223c50 cell bodies selected at random in neuronal cultures and averaged over five independent cultures (* < 0.01, ** < 0.005). Scale bar, 10 \u03bcm.The enkephalin analog d-Ala2--Me-Phe4-Glycol5-enkephalin (DAMGO) is known to drive MOR endocytosis more readily and to a greater degree than morphine in many cell types (Keith et al., 1998; Whistler et al., 1999; Bushell et al., 2002; Trafton and Basbaum, 2004). Thus we tested whether activation of NK1Rs receptors can also inhibit endocytosis of MOR induced by DAMGO. Incubation of striatal neurons with 10 \u03bcm DAMGO for 30 min produced substantial internalization of F-MOR, which was somewhat larger in absolute magnitude than that induced by morphine (Fig. 2, white bars). Coapplication of substance P resulted in a less pronounced, but still significant, inhibition of F-MOR endocytosis. Thus, NK1R-mediated inhibition of MOR trafficking is not restricted to opiate drugs such as morphine, and can also affect regulated endocytosis induced by opioid peptide.We next asked whether the pronounced inhibitory effect of NK1R activation on MOR trafficking could be observed in a cultured cell model that is advantageous for mechanistic and biochemical studies. Typically, morphine drives endocytosis of MORs poorly in transformed cell lines (Keith et al., 1996; Alvarez et al., 2002). Nevertheless, by surveying a number of neurosecretory cell types, we found rapid morphine-mediated endocytosis of MORs in mouse-derived Neuro2A (N2A) cells. We first assessed the subcellular translocation of F-MOR and HA-NK1Rs with antibody labeling of cells transiently coexpressing these two receptors under various agonist conditions. Confocal microscopy demonstrated a predominantly plasma membrane distribution of both receptor types in the absence of ligand (Fig. 3, top row). Exposure to 10 \u03bcm morphine for 30 min selectively promoted redistribution of F-MORs to intracellular vesicles, whereas HA-NK1Rs remained predominantly on the cell surface (Fig. 3, second row). Conversely, incubation with substance P resulted in selective internalization of HA-NK1Rs but not F-MORs (Fig. 3, third row). Further replicating the results obtained in striatal neurons, simultaneous incubation of N2A cells with both morphine and substance P resulted in selective internalization of HA-NK1Rs and little visible redistribution of F-MOR from the plasma membrane (Fig. 3, bottom row). Quantification by ratiometric imaging confirmed the inhibitory effect of HA-NK1R activation on morphine-induced endocytosis of F-MORs (Fig. 3, black bars). DAMGO-induced internalization of F-MOR was also significantly inhibited by HA-NK1R activation in N2A cells, and this was even more pronounced than observed in striatal neurons (Fig. 3, white bars).Heterologous regulation of F-MOR endocytosis in mouse neuroblastoma (N2A) cells. , Dual-labeled confocal fluorescence micrographs show F-MOR (red) and HA-NK1R (green) transiently expressed in N2A cells. In untreated cells, both F-MOR and HA-NK1R showed a plasma membrane distribution, with minimal labeled receptors present internally in the cell (top). Incubation with either 10 \u03bcm MS or 10 \u03bcm SP for 30 min resulted in a selective increase in either labeled F-MORs (second row, first panel) or HA-NK1Rs (third row, middle panel), respectively, present internally in the cell. Simultaneous incubation with MS and SP produced visibly less F-MOR internalization than incubation with MS alone (bottom row, first panel). Scale bar, 10 \u03bcm. , Quantification of ratiometric staining in N2A cells shows inhibition of F-MOR internalization in response to both MS and DG when S was also present. Bar graphs represent mean internalization determined from \u223c50 cell bodies selected at random in N2A cultures and averaged over five independent transfections (** < 0.005, *** < 0.0005). , Isolated biotinylated F-MORs were detected by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody in N2A cells coexpressing both F-MOR and HA-NK1R. Incubation with both SP and MS (lane 4) or DG (lane 6), compared with either MOR agonist alone (lanes 3 and 5), for 30 min resulted in a decrease in the internalized pool of F-MORs ( = 3 independent experiments).To further confirm the HA-NK1R-dependent inhibition of F-MOR endocytosis, we used a biochemical assay to specifically measure the fate of surface-biotinylated receptors in a population of cells coexpressing both F-MOR and HA-NK1R. Cells were surface biotinylated and then subjected to agonist incubation for 30 min. Biotin attached to receptors remaining in the plasma membrane was selectively cleaved using a membrane-impermeant reducing agent, and the internalized (still biotinylated) pool of F-MORs was selectively detected following isolation on streptavidin beads. Very little biotinylated signal was detected in cells incubated in the absence of opioid agonist, confirming the efficiency of the cleavage reaction and, as expected, both morphine and DAMGO produced significant internalization of F-MORs (a representative immunoblot is shown in Fig. 3; compare lane 1 with lanes 3 and 5). F-MOR internalization induced by both opioid agonists was dramatically reduced, essentially to the level of untreated control cells, when cells were incubated in the presence of substance P together with either morphine or DAMGO (Fig. 3, compare lanes 3 and 5 with lanes 4 and 6).What is the mechanism underlying the HA-NK1R-dependent inhibition of MOR endocytosis? Given that NK1R is a Gq-coupled receptor, one possibility is endocytic inhibition could occur as a consequence of Gq-mediated signaling via phospholipase C (PLC). This hypothesis is potentially consistent with a previous report that protein kinase C (an effector of the Gq-PLC pathway) can inhibit MOR internalization (Ueda et al., 2001), but is contradicted by the recent finding that activation of a distinct Gq-coupled receptor (the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor) enhances rather than inhibits MOR internalization (Lopez-Gimenez et al., 2008). Further arguing against this hypothesis, we found that blocking PLC activity in N2A cells using the specific inhibitor U73122 did not prevent NK1R-dependent inhibition of MOR endocytosis (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Another hypothesis is that the observed endocytic inhibition is caused by depletion of functional arrestin activity from the cytoplasm by sequestration on the endosome membrane. Whereas many GPCRs (including MOR) rapidly dissociate from arrestins upon endocytosis, a subset of GPCRs (including the NK1R) are capable of driving pronounced sequestration of arrestins on endosomes (Oakley et al., 2001). Further, endosomal sequestration by such GPCRs was shown previously to mediate heterologous inhibition of endocytosis of nonsequestering GPCRs in non-CNS cells (Klein et al., 2001; Schmidlin et al., 2002). To examine whether depletion of arrestin might mediate HA-NK1R-dependent inhibition of MOR endocytosis in neuronal cells, we first asked whether increasing cytoplasmic arrestin by overexpression is sufficient to rescue morphine-induced endocytosis of MOR. To do so we focused on arrestin 3 (\u03b2-arrestin2), which is expressed natively in the striatum and extended amygdala (Gurevich et al., 2002). EGFP-tagged \u03b2-arrestin2 was transfected into N2A cells coexpressing F-MOR and HA-NK1Rs, and triple color confocal microscopy was used to detect and localize each of the proteins specifically. In contrast to cells expressing arrestins at endogenous levels, coactivation of HA-NK1Rs in cells overexpressing \u03b2-arrestin2 failed to inhibit morphine-induced endocytosis of F-MOR (Fig. 4). This was indicated by the ability of both F-MOR and HA-NK1Rs to endocytose rapidly to an overlapping population of endocytic vesicles in cells exposed to both morphine and substance P, and these endocytic vesicles also visibly sequestered EGFP-tagged \u03b2-arrestin2 from the cytoplasm.Overexpression of \u03b2-arrestin2-EGFP in N2A cells coexpressing F-MOR and HA-NK1R prevents inhibition of F-MOR endocytosis. Confocal fluorescence micrographs of N2A cells coexpressing F-MOR (red), HA-NK1R (blue), and \u03b2-arrestin2-EGFP (green). Overexpression of \u03b2-arrestin2 resulted in internalization of F-MOR (bottom row, first panel) in response to 30 min of 10 \u03bcm MS even in the presence of 10 \u03bcm SP. Internalization of HA-NK1R was not detectably affected by \u03b2-arrestin2 overexpression (bottom row, second panel). Scale bar, 20 \u03bcm.To determine whether arrestin sequestration occurs in N2A cells, we coexpressed HA-NK1R and EGFP-tagged \u03b2-arrestin2 and examined arrestin redistribution after substance P treatment. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that activation of HA-NK1R for 30 min was sufficient to promote rapid and pronounced redistribution of EGFP-tagged \u03b2-arrestin2 to receptor-containing endosomes (Fig. 5, left column). This effect was specific to HA-NK1Rs because activation of F-MORs with either morphine or DAMGO alone did not produce detectable sequestration of arrestin on endosomes (data not shown). By truncating a distal portion of the HA-NK1R tail (HA-NK1 355x), we were able to disrupt substance P-induced arrestin sequestration on endosomes (Fig. 5, right column). This portion of the NK1R tail was previously shown to be required for endosomal sequestration of arrestins in non-neural cells (Oakley et al., 2001). Importantly, substance P-induced receptor endocytosis was not blocked by this mutation (Fig. 5, bottom right).Mutational disruption of NK1R-mediated sequestration of \u03b2-arrestin prevents inhibition of F-MOR endocytosis in N2A cells. , Confocal micrographs of N2A cells coexpressing either full-length HA-NK1R (left panels, red) or truncated HA-NK1R (right panels, red) with \u03b2-arrestin2-EGFP (green). Incubation with 10 \u03bcm SP in cells expressing the truncated HA-NK1R (355x) resulted in less colocalization with receptors in endosomal clusters and higher cytoplasmic \u03b2-arrestin2-EGFP distribution (left column) than \u03b2-arrestin2-EGFP distribution in the wild-type HA-NK1R under the same conditions (right column). Scale bar, 10 \u03bcm. , In N2A cells coexpressing F-MOR (red) and HA-NK1 355x receptors (green), both morphine and DAMGO were able to drive internalization of F-MORs even in the presence of substance P. Scale bar, 10 \u03bcm. , Quantification using ratiometric staining of F-MORs in N2A cells coexpressing HA-NK1 355x revealed that coincubation with SP produced levels of F-MOR internalization similar to treatment with either MS or DG alone. Bar graphs represent mean internalization determined from \u223c50 cell bodies selected at random in the N2A cultures and averaged over four independent transfections. , Biochemical assay of F-MOR internalization by surface biotinylation confirmed that F-MOR internalization induced by either MS or DG (lanes 3 and 5) was not significantly inhibited by coapplication of SP (lanes 4 and 6;  = 3 independent experiments).We next asked whether disrupting arrestin sequestration prevents endocytic inhibition of MORs in cells expressing arrestins at endogenous levels. N2A cells expressing F-MOR and HA-NK1 355x were exposed to their respective agonists individually or in combination. As expected, incubation with morphine or substance P alone selectively promoted endocytosis of F-MORs or HA-NK1Rs, respectively (data not shown). However, rapid endocytosis of both F-MORs and HA-NK1 355x receptors was also observed in cells exposed to both morphine and substance P, in contrast to the endocytic inhibition of MOR produced by coactivation of the wild-type HA-NK1R (Fig. 5, top panels). Similarly, incubation with DAMGO also resulted in MOR endocytosis, even in the presence of substance P (Fig. 5, bottom panels).Ratiometric quantification of F-MOR internalization in N2A cells coexpressing HA-NK1 355x confirmed that the degree of internalization observed in cells exposed to both morphine and substance P was not significantly different from that observed when exposed to morphine alone (Fig. 5, black bars). Similarly, the endocytic inhibitory effect on DAMGO-induced internalization was also greatly reduced (Fig. 5, white bars). Biochemical analysis using surface biotinylation of receptors further confirmed this loss of endocytic inhibition. Addition of substance P to the culture medium did not detectably reduce the internalized pool of F-MORs produced by either morphine or DAMGO (Fig. 5, compare lanes 3 and 5 with lanes 4 and 6). Together, these results strongly suggest that endosomal sequestration of arrestin by activated HA-NK1Rs is both necessary and sufficient to produce the observed inhibition of F-MOR endocytosis in N2A cells.To determine whether a similar mechanism mediates the NK1R-dependent endocytic inhibitory effect in striatal neurons, we performed the equivalent experiment in primary neuronal cultures coexpressing F-MOR and HA-NK1 355x. In contrast to the significant inhibition of morphine-induced endocytosis of F-MOR observed in cells produced by activating wild-type HA-NK1Rs, substance P-mediated activation of HA-NK1 355x did not prevent morphine induced endocytosis of F-MOR (Fig. 6 top panels; compare with Fig. 1). DAMGO-induced endocytosis of F-MOR was also not detectably impaired by activation of coexpressed HA-NK1 355x receptors (Fig. 6, bottom panels).Mutational disruption of NK1R-mediated sequestration of \u03b2-arrestin prevents inhibition of F-MOR endocytosis in striatal neurons. Dual-labeled epifluorescence micrographs show F-MOR (red) and HA-NK1R (green) distribution in striatal neurons. Insets within images show magnification of representative receptor distribution. Incubation with 10 \u03bcm MS for 30 min resulted in a redistribution of F-MORs in striatal neurons even in the presence of 10 \u03bcm SP when the truncated version of the NK1R was coexpressed with F-MOR (top row). A similar redistribution of F-MOR was observed when neurons were incubated with both 10 \u03bcm DG and SP. Scale bar, 20 \u03bcm.To begin to assess the functional significance of this arrestin-dependent MOR-NK1R regulatory effect, we examined MOR signaling via heterotrimeric G-proteins. Because MORs couple primarily to Gi, we used forskolin to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity and examined MOR signaling via inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP production in cultured striatal neurons coexpressing F-MORs and HA-NK1Rs. As expected, exposure of neurons to morphine for 3 min significantly inhibited cAMP production (Fig. 7). This acute signaling response was not detectably affected by coactivation of HA-NK1Rs with substance P. Furthermore, consistent with HA-NK1R coupling primarily to Gq, substance P-mediated activation of HA-NK1Rs in the absence of opiate did not change cAMP levels detectably from the control (i.e., forskolin only) condition.NK1R-mediated inhibition of MOR endocytosis is associated with reduced functional desensitization of opioid-dependent regulation of adenylyl cyclase. Striatal neurons coexpressing F-MOR and HA-NK1R were cultured and assayed for cAMP levels (see Materials and Methods). , The amount of cAMP accumulated in response to adenylyl cyclase stimulation with 3 \u03bcm forskolin was defined as 100% cAMP production (left bar). Bars represent mean forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation observed in the presence of a saturating concentration (10 \u03bcm) of morphine (MS), substance P (SP), or both ( = 4, ** < 0.005, *** < 0.0005). , Neurons were preincubated for 30 min in the absence or presence of 10 \u03bcm MS alone, or 10 \u03bcm MS together with 10 \u03bcm SP. After agonist washout, neurons were rechallenged for 10 min with a subsaturating concentration (100 nm) of MS together with 3 \u03bcm forskolin. Bars represent mean cAMP accumulation measured in the rechallenge period compared with that induced by forskolin alone in previously untreated neurons ( = 4, * < 0.05).To examine whether NK1R-mediated inhibition of MOR endocytosis is associated with an effect on MOR desensitization, we assayed the ability of morphine to inhibit cAMP accumulation in neurons preexposed to agonist. Preincubation of neurons with morphine for 30 min attenuated the ability of a second challenge of morphine to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in neurons, compared with the morphine-induced inhibition observed in opiate-naive neurons (Fig. 7, compare bars 2 and 3 from the left). Interestingly, this morphine-induced attenuation of subsequent opiate response was significantly reduced by inclusion of substance P in the preincubation (Fig. 7, compare bars 3 and 4 from the left). We verified in control experiments that forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation measured in the absence of opioid did not differ significantly between the pretreatment conditions when compared with drug-naive neurons (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Together, these results indicate that NK1R activation does not detectably affect acute opiate signaling, but significantly reduces functional desensitization of MOR signaling produced by opiate preexposure.To determine whether a similar inhibition of MOR endocytosis can occur with receptors expressed at endogenous levels, we explored this phenomenon in several populations of neurons where both MOR and NK1Rs are reportedly coexpressed. In our cultures, immunocytochemical staining of dissociated striatal cultures revealed that MOR and NK1Rs were expressed largely in distinct neurons, making this preparation unfavorable for examining heterologous regulation of endogenous receptor trafficking (data not shown).Another brain region that is known to coexpress these receptors and modulate behavioral reward to opioids is the amygdala (Nakaya et al., 1994; Gadd et al., 2003; Poulin et al., 2006). We cultured primary rat amygdala neurons and found that a subset of these neurons were positive for both endogenous MOR and NK1R immunoreactivity, while others expressed only one but not the other receptor type. In neurons expressing MORs but not NK1Rs, incubation of cultures with both 10 \u03bcm DAMGO and substance P for 30 min resulted in a pronounced redistribution of MOR immunoreactivity, indicative of rapid internalization of MORs (Fig. 8, top left). In contrast, redistribution of MORs was substantially reduced in neurons coexpressing both MORs and NK1Rs under the same agonist conditions, while NK1R endocytosis in response to substance P was unaffected (Fig. 8, bottom row). We verified in control experiments that DAMGO alone stimulated a pronounced redistribution of MOR in both NK1R-positive and -negative neurons (data not shown). These results suggest that inhibition of MOR internalization by NK1R activation also occurs in neurons that endogenously express these receptors.Heterologous inhibition of MOR endocytosis mediated by endogenously expressed NK1Rs. , Dual localization of endogenous MORs and NK1Rs was visualized in dissociated amygdala cultures after coincubation with 10 \u03bcm DAMGO and 10 \u03bcm SP for 30 min. Pronounced internalization of endogenous MOR was observed in cells not expressing detectable NK1R immunoreactivity (top), while internalization of MOR was dramatically inhibited in neurons (visualized on the same coverslip) expressing both MOR and NK1R (bottom). Epifluorescence images shown are representative of three independent experiments and were processed in parallel. Scale bar, 10 \u03bcm. , Two-photon fluorescence imaging of F-MOR trafficking in live locus ceruleus neurons prepared from F-MOR-Tg/+, MOR\u2212/\u2212 mice. F-MORs present in the plasma membrane were labeled by incubating acutely prepared brain slices with M1-Alexa594 for 45 min (top left). The same neuron was then perfused with 10 \u03bcm [Met]5enkephalin (ME) for 15 min (top middle). Remaining surface-accessible receptors were then stripped by adding calcium-free buffer containing EGTA (top right). The same series of manipulations performed in the presence of 10 \u03bcm SP perfusion (bottom). Examples of midplane optical sections are shown. , Summary of the internalization results obtained by measurement of EGTA-resistant Alexa594 measured in neurons across multiple experiments. ME exposure increased F-MOR uptake from residual levels 36 \u00b1 5% ( = 3) to 71.5 \u00b1 4.4% ( = 15). Application of ME in the presence of SP significantly reduced FLAG-MOR uptake (57.1 \u00b1 3.7%,  = 15, * = 0.01). Each experiment represents imaging of a different brain slice, compiled from dissection of 11 animals. Scale bar, 10 \u03bcm.To test whether cross-inhibition occurs in another relevant population of CNS neurons, and to obtain quantitative data, we examined the effect of substance P on MOR internalization using locus ceruleus neurons from F-MOR Tg+/\u2212, MOR\u2212/\u2212 mice (Arttamangkul et al., 2008). This brain region consists primarily of noradrenergic neurons, which possess a high density of both endogenous MORs and NK1Rs (Cheeseman et al., 1983; Tempel and Zukin, 1987; Nakaya et al., 1994). In slices imaged in the absence of agonist, immunoreactive MOR was localized primarily in the plasma membrane, as indicated by the peripheral staining pattern in two-photon optical sections (Fig. 8, top left panel). Because morphine does not cause significant internalization in LC neurons, [Met]5enkephalin (ME) was used in these experiments (Arttamangkul et al., 2008). Bath application of 10 \u03bcm ME for 15 min induced a redistribution of F-MOR receptors to a punctate pattern consistent with regulated endocytosis of MOR (Fig. 8, top middle panel). This was confirmed by subsequent application of calcium-free EGTA solution, which dissociates antibody from surface-accessible receptors, leaving the internalized receptor pool specifically labeled (Fig. 8, top right panel). Application of 10 \u03bcm substance P to slices did not detectably change the plasma membrane localization pattern of labeled MOR (Fig. 8, bottom left panel), indicating that activating the NK1Rs alone did not promote significant internalization of MOR. Subsequent application of ME, in the continued presence of substance P, produced some redistribution of MOR but the magnitude of this effect was visibly reduced compared with that observed in slices exposed to ME alone (Fig. 8, middle panels). Consistent with this, the internalized fraction of labeled MOR, which is resistant to the EGTA strip condition, was also visibly reduced in slices exposed to ME in the presence of substance P (Fig. 8, right panels). Quantification of these results over multiple experiments confirmed that substance P significantly inhibited ME-induced internalization of MOR in locus ceruleus neurons (Fig. 8).The present results demonstrate that NK1R activation mediates a pronounced and cell-autonomous inhibition of MOR endocytosis induced by diverse opioid agonists. Whereas either morphine or DAMGO promote rapid endocytosis of MOR in striatal neurons, simultaneous activation of NK1Rs with substance P strongly inhibited this fundamental regulatory process. We identified a transformed neurosecretory cell line in which pronounced morphine-induced endocytosis of MOR also occurs, and observed a similar endocytic inhibition mediated by NK1R activation in these cells. Our results indicate that, in both cell types, inhibition of MOR endocytosis is mediated by NK1R-dependent sequestration of arrestins on endosomes. This cell-autonomous regulatory mechanism was also found to produce a functionally significant attenuation of morphine-induced desensitization of MOR signaling via adenylyl cyclase. Furthermore, heterologous regulation of MOR trafficking was established in two additional populations of CNS neurons that mediate behavioral effects of opiate drugs and was observed in neurons expressing receptors at endogenous levels. Together, these observations strongly suggest that NK1Rs can significantly modulate both trafficking and downstream signaling of MORs in multiple populations of physiologically relevant CNS neurons.Our findings thus identify a novel mode of functional interaction between MORs and NK1Rs. A previous study of these two GPCRs expressed in a non-neural cell model (HEK293 cells) reported that ligand-induced activation of either MOR or NK1R promoted coendocytosis of both GPCRs by formation of MOR/NK1R heterodimers (Pfeiffer et al., 2003). Such heterodimer-driven endocytic \u201cdragging\u201d was not clearly evident in the present study, as opioid and neurokinin agonists selectively promoted endocytosis of MORs and NK1Rs, respectively. Furthermore, several observations argue that the regulatory interaction revealed in the present study cannot be explained by heterodimer formation. First, activation of NK1Rs inhibited, rather than promoted, MOR endocytosis. Second, we did not observe rapid endocytosis of either MOR or NK1R in the absence of the appropriate receptor agonist. Third, the observed cross-regulatory effect was nonreciprocal, as NK1R activation inhibited MOR endocytosis but not vice versa. The present results do not exclude heterodimer-based regulation of opioid receptors by neurokinins, and we are aware that the degree to which various GPCRs form heteromeric complexes varies among cell types (Bouvier, 2001). Our findings argue strongly, however, that the distinct mechanism established in the present study plays a dominant role in mediating functional interaction between MOR and NK1Rs in CNS neurons.Cell autonomous, nonreciprocal endocytic inhibition has been observed previously among various GPCRs in non-neural cells as well as myenteric neurons (Klein et al., 2001; Schmidlin et al., 2002), and is consistent with the existence of significant differences among individual GPCRs in their ability to mediate arrestin trafficking from the cytoplasm to the endosome membrane (Oakley et al., 1999). NK1Rs, in particular, are able to mediate arrestin sequestration on endosomes in HEK293 cells (Oakley et al., 2001; Schmidlin et al., 2002). To our knowledge the present results are the first to demonstrate that arrestin sequestration can mediate heterologous regulation of GPCR trafficking in CNS neurons. Second, we show that this links NK1R activation to regulation of MORs in multiple populations of CNS neurons relevant to the behavioral effects of opiate drugs, and that this regulation can be observed among endogenously expressed receptors. Thus, we believe that arrestin trafficking to endosome membranes likely represents a fundamental mechanism for integrating receptor-mediated signaling effects across distinct GPCRs in diverse neural cell types. Furthermore, this function of arrestin trafficking in signal integration is clearly distinct from the previously proposed role of endosome-associated arrestins in scaffolding signaling complexes on the endosome membrane in response to activation of particular GPCRs (Lefkowitz et al., 2006). Although the actual stoichiometry of nonvisual arrestins (or \u03b2-arrestins) relative to GPCRs is not clearly established in native cell types, our finding that endogenously expressed receptors mediate significant heterologous inhibition in both amygdala and locus ceruleus neurons suggests that the effective functional activity of \u03b2-arrestins is a limiting factor determining endocytic regulation of GPCRs in relevant CNS neurons. This conclusion, in addition to its specific relevance to opioid regulation, suggests a general principle that may underlie regulation between diverse GPCR-mediated signaling processes occurring simultaneously in the same neurons.It is likely that the ability of NK1R activation to alter morphine's endocytic activity can persist even in the absence of continuous substance P release. Recycling of NK1Rs is reported to be slow in various cell types (Grady et al., 1995, 1996; Wang and Marviz\u00f3n, 2002). Dissociation of the \u03b2-arrestin-receptor complex is dependent on dephosphorylation of receptors in endosomes and important for resensitization of internalized NK1Rs (Garland et al., 1996). Prolonged retention of \u03b2-arrestins on endosomes, together with slow recycling of NK1Rs, could thus result in low cytoplasmic levels of this regulatory protein after an initial round of receptor activation. In addition, the lack of MOR desensitization as a result of inhibiting endocytosis alters the normal signaling response to drugs such as morphine. Thus, it is possible that the NK1R-mediated regulation of MOR endocytosis, in addition to its acute trafficking effects, contributes to longer-term plasticity in the regulatory profile of opioid drugs.We were surprised to find a lack of overlap in MOR and NK1R expression on our dissociated striatal culture preparation. It is possible that this reflects developmental differences between our cultures (which are derived from embryonic rats) and adult animals used in previous studies (Pickel et al., 2000; Jabourian et al., 2005). However, we did observe that MORs and NK1Rs are coexpressed in a significant fraction of cultured amygdala neurons. This brain region is known to be important for mediating conditioned reward processes, expresses both MOR and NK1R, and ablation of NK1Rs in these neurons has previously been reported to reduce morphine reward behavior (Everitt et al., 1991; Gadd et al., 2003). We also observed substance P-induced heterologous inhibition of MOR internalization in an acute slice preparation of locus ceruleus, using a recently developed method that allowed quantitative assessment of MOR endocytosis (Arttamangkul et al., 2008). In addition to the amygdala, NK1R-expressing neurons in the locus ceruleus may also play a role in morphine-driven behaviors (Nestler et al., 1994) and in opiate withdrawal (Redmond and Krystal, 1984; Rasmussen et al., 1990). Therefore, it is conceivable that the cell-autonomous regulation established in the present study contributes to NK1R-dependent modulation of opiate responses evident from study of NK1R-knock-out animals and animals in which NK1R function is chemically ablated (Gadd et al., 2003). There is also considerable coexpression of MOR and NK1R in the trigeminal dorsal horn (Aicher et al., 2000). Although we did not examine this region in the present study, and NK1Rs are not essential for morphine antinociception  (De Felipe et al., 1998), it is possible that receptor coexpression could confer NK1R-dependent regulation on opioid signaling in these neurons as well.The observed inhibitory effect of NK1R activation on MOR endocytosis and desensitization in CNS neurons suggests a novel mechanism by which neurokinin signaling may affect opioid responses in multiple brain regions. Important questions for future study include further examination of the effects of cell-autonomous regulation on opioid-mediated neurophysiology and investigation into how interaction between these two neurochemical systems affects functional connectivity between other brain regions. For example, the central nucleus of the amygdala receives reciprocal dopaminergic afferents from the ventral tegmental area and is connected to the core of the nucleus accumbens in the striatum (Ungerstedt, 1971; Wallace et al., 1992). It is conceivable, therefore, that the ability of other GPCRs to alter the trafficking and signaling properties of MORs in response to opiates could have profound effects on neural circuits driving reward behavior. By establishing cell-autonomous regulation of MOR by NK1R activation in several neuronal populations, the present study identifies a new principle by which diverse GPCR-linked signaling systems may be coordinately regulated in the CNS.This work was supported by research grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).Y.J.Y. received support from a Gallo Predoctoral Fellowship in Alcohol and Addiction Studies and an NIH predoctoral fellowship (F31DA024530-01).

Here, we examined neuronal representations of species-specific vocalizations, which are communication sounds that many species rely on for survival and social interaction. In some species, the evoked responses of auditory cortex neurons are stronger in response to natural conspecific vocalizations than to their time-reversed, spectrally identical, counterparts. We applied information theory-based analyses to single-unit spike trains collected in the auditory cortex ( = 139) and auditory thalamus ( = 135) of anesthetized animals as well as in the auditory cortex ( = 119) of awake guinea pigs during presentation of four conspecific vocalizations. Few thalamic and cortical cells (<10%) displayed a firing rate preference for the natural version of these vocalizations. In contrast, when the information transmitted by the spike trains was quantified with a temporal precision of 10\u201350 ms, many cells (>75%) displayed a significant amount of information (i.e., >2SD above chance levels), especially in the awake condition. The computed correlation index between spike trains (corr, defined by Schreiber et al., 2003) indicated similar spike-timing reliability for both the natural and time-reversed versions of each vocalization, but higher reliability for awake animals compared with anesthetized animals. Based on temporal discharge patterns, even cells that were only weakly responsive to vocalizations displayed a significant level of information. These findings emphasize the importance of temporal discharge patterns as a coding mechanism for natural communication sounds, particularly in awake animals.Acoustic communication is crucial for survival and social interactions in many species. Understanding how conspecific vocalizations are encoded in the auditory pathway is a prerequisite for deciphering the neural bases of acoustic communication. The idea that neuronal specialization has emerged for processing conspecific vocalizations is supported by cumulative evidence indicating that during development the cortical map and functional properties of auditory cortex (ACx) neurons undergo continuous changes to adapt to environmental acoustic stimuli (Chang and Merzenich, 2003; Engineer et al., 2004; Nakahara et al., 2004; Chang et al., 2005; de Villers-Sidani et al., 2007). These developmental dynamics potentially explain why neurons exhibit a strong preference for natural acoustic stimuli present in the animal environment. In songbird, in particular brain areas such as the nucleus HVC (but also the nucleus NIf), neurons display highly selective responses, firing more to playback of the bird's own song (BOS) than to the reversed BOS or other conspecific songs (for review, see Margoliash, 1997; Doupe and Kuhl, 1999; Nealen and Schmidt, 2002; Prather and Mooney, 2004). No such selectivity has been reported in mammals, but, using the firing rate of cortical cells as a metric, most ACx neurons in the marmoset auditory cortex prefer the natural version of the Twitter call over its time-reversed version (Wang et al., 1995; Wang, 2000). This is not the case for neurons recorded in the cat ACx (Wang and Kadia, 2001). The preference for natural versions of conspecific vocalizations over their time-reversed versions is not observed in either the squirrel monkey ACx (Glass and Wollberg, 1983a,b; Pelleg-Toiba and Wollberg, 1991) or cat ACx (Gehr et al., 2000). This discrepancy may depend on several factors, such as the species, type of natural stimuli, and potential sample bias of the type of cortical cells recorded. Recent findings suggest an alternative hypothesis. Schnupp et al. (2006) demonstrated that reliable discriminations between natural and time-reversed vocalizations could be achieved based on temporal discharge patterns operating at the 10 ms scale, indicating that natural stimuli can be encoded by temporal information rather than by the average firing rate. The aim of the present study was twofold. The first goal was to evaluate whether cortical and thalamic neurons respond with higher rates to conspecific guinea-pig vocalizations compared with those same vocalizations played in reverse (these time-reversed vocalizations have the same frequency power spectrum but the spectrotemporal structure of the natural vocalization is disrupted). The second goal was to evaluate the respective contributions of firing rate and spike timing to the information carried by the natural and time-reversed versions of these vocalizations. The firing rate of auditory thalamus and ACx neurons was first quantified using the index previously used to reveal the selectivity of ACx neurons for the natural version of marmoset vocalizations (Wang and Kadia, 2001). Then, the difference in the temporal organization of spike trains elicited on presentation of the natural and time-reversed vocalizations was quantified using the metric-space method developed by Victor and Purpura (Victor and Purpura, 1996, 1997). This method can be used to determine the relative contribution of the firing rate and the spike-timing precision in the information conveyed by neuronal spike trains. To determine whether spike timing is more reliable on presentation of the natural or time-reversed stimuli, a correlation index was computed (corr) (Schreiber et al., 2003).The response selectivity described in animals under anesthesia cannot necessarily be reproduced in awake animals. For example, in the avian brain, the selective responses for the BOS observed during periods of synchronized EEG (anesthesia or slow-wave sleep) were not observed in awake birds (Schmidt and Konishi, 1998; Cardin and Schmidt, 2003, 2004). Similarly, the strength of evoked responses and the temporal discharge patterns in the mammalian auditory system differ considerably between anesthetized and awake animals (Torterolo et al., 2002; Cotillon-Williams and Edeline, 2003, 2004; Massaux et al., 2004; Populin, 2005); for other references see (Hennevin et al., 2007). Thus, in the present study, to ensure that the anesthetic did not mask some aspect of the neural code that is in use in awake animals, we also analyzed neuronal spike trains recorded in the auditory cortex of awake guinea pigs. Parts of these results were presented in an abstract format (Huetz et al., 2007).Experiments were performed on 26 adult guinea pigs (390\u2013650 g; national authorization No. 91-271 to conduct animal research) anesthetized by an initial injection of diazepam (6 mg/kg, i.p.) followed by urethane (1.2 g/kg, i.p.). Additional doses of urethane (0.5 g/kg, i.p.) were systematically delivered when reflex movements were observed after pinching the hindpaw (usually once or twice during a given recording session). The body temperature was maintained around 37\u00b0C by a heating pad throughout the experiment. The trachea was cannulated and a local anesthetic (xylocaine, 2%) was infiltrated into the wound. The stereotaxic frame supporting the animal was placed in a sound-attenuating chamber (IAC, model AC2).For the thalamic recordings, a circular hole was drilled in the skull above the medial geniculate body (MGB) and electrodes were vertically penetrated. For the cortical recordings, a large opening was made in the temporal bone and very small slits were made in the dura mater under microscopic control. A diagram of the pattern of vasculature was drawn and the location of the primary field (AI) was estimated based on our previous studies (Edeline et al., 1993; Manunta and Edeline, 1999). The cortical surface was rapidly mapped to confirm the location of AI: neuronal clusters were recorded with low impedance (<1 M\u03a9) electrodes until a progression from low to high frequency was observed in the caudorostral direction (Wallace et al., 2000). During each recording session, the first electrode penetration was made with tungsten microelectrodes (>8 M\u03a9) and the following penetrations (at nearby locations) were made with glass micropipettes (5\u201310 M\u03a9). The signal from the electrode was amplified (gain 1000, bandpass 0.3\u201310 kHz,), and multiplexed to an audio monitor and a voltage window discriminator. The waveform of the action potentials and the corresponding TTL pulses generated by the discriminator were continuously displayed, digitized (50 kHz sampling rate, Superscope, GW Instruments), and stored for off-line analyses. The pulses were sent to the acquisition board (PClab, PCL 720) of a laboratory microcomputer, which recorded them with a 50 \u03bcs resolution and provided on-line displays of the neuronal responses. Both in thalamus and cortex, successive recording sites were separated by at least 100 \u03bcm in depth. At the end of the recording session (10\u201312 h), the animal was killed by a lethal dose of pentobarbital (200 mg/kg).Adult guinea pigs (390\u2013550 g,  = 12) underwent surgery under anesthesia (atropine 0.08 mg/kg, diazepam 8 mg/kg, pentobarbital 20 mg/kg; see (Evans, 1979). Three silverball electrodes were inserted between the bone and dura: one was used as a reference during the recording sessions; the other two, placed over the frontal and parietal cortices, served to monitor the cortical electroencephalogram (EEG). An array of 5\u20138 tungsten electrodes (\u223c1.0 M\u03a9 at 1 kHz, spaced 200\u2013300 \u03bcm in the rostrocaudal axis) was slowly inserted in the auditory cortex under electrophysiologic control. Starting from 600 \u03bcm below the pia, responses to pure tone frequencies were tested at regular depths to optimize the strength of evoked responses; the final placement depth of the electrodes ranged from 800 to 1250 \u03bcm. A dental acrylic cement pedestal, including two cylindrical threaded tubes, was built to allow for atraumatic fixation of the animal's head during the subsequent recording sessions. An antiseptic ointment (Cidermex, neomycine sulfate, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer) was liberally applied to the wound around the pedestal. All surgical procedures were performed in compliance with the guidelines determined by the national (JO 887\u2013848) and European (86/609/EEC) legislations on animal experimentation, which are similar to those described in the  In addition, regular inspections of our laboratory by accredited veterinarians designated by Paris-Sud University confirmed that care was taken to maximize the animals' health and comfort throughout the different phases of the experiment.Three days after surgery, each animal was adapted to restrained conditions in an acoustically isolated chamber (IAC, model AC2) for several days. The animal was placed in a hammock with the head fixed for increasing periods of time (1\u20133 h/d). The animal was also accustomed to hearing sequences of pure tone bursts as well as different vocalizations used subsequently to test the neuronal responses.All animals used in the present study (both in the anesthetized and awake conditions) were housed in a colony room and were grouped by four or five animals in large plastic cages (75 \u00d7 55 \u00d7 25 cm; Tecniplast, Buguggiate, Italy) with large wire mesh doors (55 \u00d7 20 cm). All animals frequently emitted vocalizations during social interactions with the other animals of the same cage and loudly vocalized during animal care and feeding.All the cells included in the present study exhibited reliable tuning curves when tested with pure tone frequencies. The sound generating system to deliver pure tone frequencies was the same as that previously described (Edeline et al., 2000, 2001; Manunta and Edeline, 2004). Pure tones (100 ms, rise/fall time 5 ms) were generated by a remotely controlled wave analyzer (Hewlett-Packard model HP 8903B) and attenuated by a passive programmable attenuator (Wavetek, P557, maximal attenuation 127 dB), both controlled via an IEEE bus. Stimuli were delivered through a calibrated earphone (Beyer DT48) placed close to the ear canal. The system was calibrated using a sound level calibrator and a condenser microphone/preamplifier (Bruel and Kjaer models 4133 and 2639T) placed at the same distance from the speaker as the animal's ear (< 5 mm). The whole sound delivery system (HP 8903B, attenuators, and speaker) was calibrated from 0.1\u201335 kHz and could deliver tones of 80 dB SPL up to 20 kHz and of 70 dB SPL up to 35 kHz. Harmonic distortion products were measured to be down \u223c50 dB from the fundamental.Once the frequency tuning was established, four vocalizations used in a previous study (Philibert et al., 2005) were presented in their natural and time-reversed versions. These vocalizations were collected from five adult male guinea pigs recorded either in pairs or individually in a sound-attenuated room. Calls were recorded using a Sennheiser MD46 microphone connected to a microcomputer and digitized using SoundEdit software (44 kHz sampling rate). The relationships between these calls and the animal behavioral repertoire have been previously described (Berryman, 1976; Harper, 1976). A \u201cpurr\u201d consists of a series of low-frequency impulses (fundamental frequency <500Hz, duration 700 ms) emitted when social contact is allowed or sought. A \u201cchirp\u201d is a brief call (0.7\u201315 kHz, <100 ms) that is believed to be a low-intensity distress call or a warning signal. A \u201cchutter\u201d consists of a chain of five components (0.5\u20133.5 kHz, 150\u2013250 ms separated from each other by 140\u2013175 ms) emitted during discomfort. A \u201cwhistle\u201d is a two-part call (250\u2013400 ms, with the first part from 1 to 3 kHz and the second part rising steeply to 8\u201320 kHz) emitted when animals are isolated or in response to stimuli associated with caretaking. We initially recorded a large set of samples for each vocalization class, and then selected one sample in each vocalization class that we considered to be the most representative of the class. Figure 1 displays the spectrograms and oscillograms of the four selected vocalizations that were used to test all neurons recorded in the present study. The time-reversed versions of the stimuli were generated by reversing the natural calls in the time domain, i.e., playing the call backward. Each call was presented at a peak intensity of 70 dB SPL sound pressure level. The natural and time-reversed versions of the four calls were presented in random order, with each call repeated 20 times with a 2 s period of silence between each vocalization. The whole protocol, i.e., testing the frequency tuning with pure tones and the responses to the four vocalizations (natural and time-reversed) lasted \u223c50 min. When recording in unanesthetized animals, the EEG was displayed on a polygraph and a computer to make sure that the animal was awake during the entire recording session (the data collection was stopped when large voltage EEG signals characteristic of slow-wave sleep were present). Each unanesthetized animal was recorded during 3\u20134 recording sessions, separated by 24 or 48 h. In all cases, the recording session was stopped each time the spike waveform became unstable. Systematic off-line examination of the digitized waveforms confirmed that spike trains of unambiguously isolated single units were recorded both in anesthetized and awake animals.Oscillogram (top) and spectrogram (bottom) of the four vocalizations used in the present study.For each cell, the frequency tuning was quantified from the threshold up to 70 dB SPL by 10 dB steps. At each intensity, the best frequency was determined as the frequency eliciting the largest evoked responses. The breadth of tuning was quantified both by the 20 dB and by the square root transformation \u221a2-\u221a1 where 2 and 1 indicate the high and low limits of the tuning bandwidth at 20 dB above threshold (this later measure is independent of the unit characteristic frequency (CF) (Whitfield, 1968; Whitfield and Purser, 1972; Calford et al., 1983). The latency of the tone-evoked responses was computed at each intensity used to test the frequency tuning curve. At a given intensity, the responses obtained for all the tested frequencies were considered, and the latency of the first spike after tone onset was computed (1 ms precision). For each cell and at each intensity, the variability of the latency was quantified by the SD of the mean latency value.Statistical tests (paired  test) were used to determine whether a given cell was \u201cresponsive\u201d to a particular vocalization. In the case of phasic responses followed by prolonged inhibition, the evoked firing rate did not significantly differ from spontaneous activity. In these cases, a cell was classified as \u201cresponsive\u201d to a particular vocalization if evoked responses were obtained for at least 10 of 20 presentations based on the rasters and histograms (5 ms bin), as evaluated by two of the authors. As previously described (Philibert et al., 2005), responsive cells can display different types of responses to vocalizations: (1) phasic (onset or offset) responses correspond to transient evoked discharges at the onset and/or the offset of the vocalizations, (2) phase-locked responses correspond to evoked discharges exhibiting multiple peaks during the purr and/or the chutter, and (3) sustained responses correspond to evoked firing rates above spontaneous activity occurring throughout the vocalization without noticeable temporal organization. Nonresponsive cells do not exhibit a significantly increased firing rate on stimulus presentation and sometimes show transient inhibition.According to the type of evoked response, either the first 100 ms (for the phasic responses) or the entire duration of the vocalization (for the phase-locked and sustained responses) was used to quantify the response strength to the natural and time-reversed version of each vocalization. The preference for the natural versus the time-reversed version was quantified by the directional index described by Wang and Kadia (2001):\n\n where nat and rev correspond to the firing rate on presentation of the natural and reversed calls, respectively. A  value of 1 (\u22121) indicates that a neuron responded to only the natural (reversed) call; zero means no firing-rate difference between the natural and reversed calls.In a recent study (Huetz et al., 2006), we extensively explained how the method developed by Victor and Purpura (1996, 1997) can be applied to determine whether, in addition to information carried by spike count, the precise timing of the spikes conveys information about acoustic stimuli. Only the major features of this method will be presented here. To consider the whole response pattern, note that only spike trains of equal duration can be processed. Therefore, we only compared the spike trains to a particular vocalization with the spike trains from the time-reversed version of this particular vocalization (and not with spike trains obtained by other vocalizations of different durations).The metric-space method involves two stages: (1) computing pairwise distances between spike trains (using the count and spike distance as defined by Victor and Purpura, 1996), and (2) measuring the information () between stimuli and spike trains as a measure of spike train clustering. The distance between two spike trains taken from two sets of trials (natural and time-reversed vocalization) is defined as the minimal \u201ccost\u201d for transforming one spike train into the other via a sequence of elementary steps. The following elementary steps are allowed: inserting a spike, deleting a spike, and shifting a spike by an amount of time . Each elementary step is associated with a cost. For eliminating or inserting a spike, the cost is unity. To shift a spike, the cost is equal to q, where  is the extent of the shift expressed in units of time bins. The parameter  (in s\u22121) accounts for and quantifies the temporal precision relevant to spike timing. Pairwise distances between all responses are computed for a given value of  and clustering is performed.Clusters can be defined as sets of spike trains that are close to each other. To evaluate the extent of the similarity between spike trains elicited by the same stimulus and those elicited by another stimulus, a confusion matrix (, ) is constructed. This matrix summarizes, for each stimulus class, how many spike trains can be attributed to this class, based on the average distance (or similarity) of this spike train from other spike trains of the same stimulus class. Here, the confusion matrix is 2 \u00d7 2, where the two columns correspond to the two stimulus classes (natural and time-reversed vocalizations), and the two rows correspond to the two response classes (natural and time-reversed vocalizations). This matrix  is then used to compute the amount of transmitted information H (Victor and Purpura, 1996):\n\n in which  is the total number of spike trains (natural and time-reversed vocalizations) and logarithms are in base 2. A perfect clustering of spike trains corresponds to a purely diagonal confusion matrix, and to an information value of  = 1. In contrast, when clustering is totally random, on and off diagonal values of the matrix are similar, leading to an information value of  = 0. In such a case, classification is impossible, meaning that either the responses were not correlated with the stimuli, or that the distance (i.e., measure of similarity) used was not appropriate for classifying the spike trains into two categories.By varying the parameter , it is possible to determine which metric spike[] produces the best clustering of spike trains and thus provides the maximum information value. When  = 0, distances between spike trains only depend on their spike count (and refers to the count distance in the work of Victor and Purpura, 1996); and as  increases, distances become sensitive to finer temporal features. Therefore, if information  is maximized for  = 0, this indicates that responses to natural versus time-reversed vocalizations can be discriminated exclusively based on spike count. In the following, such cases will be called \u201crate responses.\u201d Conversely, if the maximum value of  is attained for  > 0, this indicates that spike timing is crucial to accurately discriminate responses to natural versus time-reversed vocalizations. In the following, such cases will be called \u201ctemporal responses.\u201dAmounts of information computed from experimental data are biased estimates of the \u201ctrue\u201d transmitted information that would ideally be obtained from an infinite number of trials for each stimulus. Therefore, additional computations should be performed to estimate the bias (or chance level) and to assess the significance of transmitted information resulting from the calculation described above. Here, the bias (or chance level) bias, is estimated as described by Victor and Purpura (1997) and as implemented in the Spike Train Analysis Toolkit (http://neuroanalysis.org/toolkit/). Information is recalculated after random reassignments of the responses across stimuli: From the set of 20 responses to natural and 20 responses to time-reversed vocalization, 20 new sets of spike trains are formed, in which responses are assigned to a randomly chosen stimulus (natural or time-reversed vocalization). For each set, information values are computed using the same procedure as for normal calculations. The mean and the SD of these 20 values are computed. The mean, bias, represents the level of chance or bias. In reporting the results, only values of  that were greater than bias+ 2 SD were considered significant and therefore only those cells that had significantly positive values of  were included.For each cell, the metric-space analysis and the calculation of the bias were performed for values of  ranging from  = 0 to  = 10\u22125 s\u22121 in logarithmic steps, thus providing a curve of the transmitted information () as a function of  as well as a curve of the bias (bias) as a function of q. Three indices were derived from these curves: max, count, and max. max represents the maximum amount of information that a cell conveys about the stimuli: it quantifies how well stimuli can be discriminated by looking at the spike trains. The index max is the value of  corresponding to max and therefore the temporal precision with which the cell conveys a maximum amount of information. count represents the amount of information that the spike count of a cell's responses conveys about the stimuli: it is the value of  when  = 0. In Results, we adopted the following notation: *max and *count are the values of max and count obtained after subtracting the mean bias value bias, and *max is the value of  corresponding to *max.The strong trial-to-trial reliability of spike trains observed on some rasters suggests that thalamocortical neurons might be entirely driven by some simple acoustic component in the stimuli. Indeed, if neurons of the auditory thalamocortical system act as simple linear spectral filters with monotonic behavior, responses to time-reversed versions of the vocalizations would correspond to the mirror image of the responses to the natural versions shifted in time by the latency of the neuronal response. In this case, the temporal discharge patterns that emerge during presentation of natural and time-reversed vocalizations should be \u201cmirror images\u201d of each other.To investigate this hypothesis, we formed a new set of spike trains. Responses to natural vocalizations were kept identical, whereas responses to reversed vocalizations were time-reversed and shifted by an appropriate temporal delay (see below). If responses to reversed vocalizations are simply the mirror image of natural vocalization responses, then the time-reversed versions of spike trains obtained during presentation of the reversed vocalization would be identical to the natural vocalization spike trains. In this case, application of the metric-space method to this new set of spike trains would result in nonsignificant amounts of transmitted information (*max \u223c0).Reversed versions of reversed vocalization spike trains were constructed by considering the end of the trial (end of the vocalization) as the beginning of the trial. At this stage of the procedure, the end of the reversed vocalization was considered as the start of the new spike trains (time 0) and the last spike was considered as the first spike, the penultimate spike as the second spike, etc. The time shift, estimated on the basis of the latency of the first spike obtained in response to the natural vocalization, was added to each new spike time.The metric-space method can be used to analyze whether the spike train temporal structure significantly contributes to the transmitted information and the particular values of temporal precision that maximize the transmitted information (max). It does not, however, reveal whether (1) a temporal organization of spike trains exists for the first, for the second, or for both stimuli (here the natural and time-reversed vocalizations) and (2) the reliability of the potential temporal organizations detected in the spike trains of both stimuli. To quantify the temporal reliability of neuronal responses on presentation of the natural and time-reversed vocalizations, a measure of correlation between spike trains was computed using a previously described method (Schreiber et al., 2003). Spike trains were first convolved with a Gaussian filter of a given width \u03c3. The inner product was then computed between all pairs of trials and each inner product was then divided by the norms of the two trials of the respective pair. Reliability, corr, is the average across all pairs of trials of this \u201cnormed inner product.\u201d Therefore, each convolved spike train i was represented as an individual vector and the correlation measure corr was given by the following:\n\n where  is the number of stimulus presentations. The width of the Gaussian filter was set to 10 ms (according to the mean *max value that was derived from the metric-space analysis).Trial-to-trial reliability of temporal patterns can differ between the four vocalizations simply because of their different durations. Indeed, phasic onset responses occurring in the first tens of milliseconds are probably more precise than later responses. Therefore, corr values simply computed for the entire stimulus duration would favor the shortest vocalizations. Here, to obtain corr values more comparable between stimuli, we computed corr values using a sliding window from the beginning to the end of each response. We chose a window of 80 ms, slid by 10 ms intervals, to have at least two values for the responses to the shortest vocalization, the chirp. This procedure led to several corr values (depending on the stimulus duration). From these values, we computed the average over all windows [corr,mean] and the maximum [corr,max]. For each stimulus, the corr,mean value, ranging from 0 (no reliability) to 1 (perfect reliability), quantifies the capability of a neuron to emit identical spike trains during successive presentations of the same stimulus over the entire duration of the stimulus. The corr,max quantifies the best spike-timing reliability that can be achieved by a neuron over the 80 ms sliding window.All computations were made with Matlab and information theoretic analyses were conducted with the Spike-Train-Analysis-Toolkit available online (http://neuroanalysis.org/toolkit/) and statistical tests were made with Statistica (Statsoft). Statistical analyses involved ANOVAs (with \u201ccondition,\u201d \u201ctype of vocalization,\u201d and \u201cdirection of the vocalization\u201d as factors) followed by  comparisons. In all cases,  < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.After each experiment performed in anesthetized animals, the brains were removed from the skull and placed in a fixative solution (4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) for 2 weeks. For animals recorded in the awake state, the animals received a lethal dose of pentobarbital (200 mg/kg) after the final recording session, and small electrolytic lesions were made by passing anodal current (10 \u03bcA, 10 s) through the recording electrodes. The animals were perfused transcardially with 0.9% saline (200 ml) followed by 2000 ml of fixative (4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4).The brains were placed in a 30% sucrose solution in 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 3\u20134 d; then, coronal serial sections of the brain were cut on a freezing microtome (50 \u03bcm thick). All serial sections were mounted on glass slides, dried, and counterstained with cresyl violet. The analysis of histologic material was performed blind to the electrophysiologic results. The sections were examined under several microscopic magnifications to find the electrode penetration tracks. For the MGB recordings, we located the recording sites using the electrode tracks for guidance, the point of entrance in the thalamus, the estimated dorsoventral extent of the MG, and the depth coordinates read from the microdrive during the experiment. In all cases, this analysis was precise enough to allow clear assignment of the recordings with regard to the MG divisions. For the cortical recordings in anesthetized animals, the depth coordinates read from the microdrive and recent determinations of the relative thickness of cortical layers in the guinea-pig ACx (Wallace and Palmer, 2008) were used to assign each recording to a cortical layer. Both in pilot experiments and in previous studies (Manunta and Edeline, 1999; Edeline et al., 2001), there was good correspondence between the value read on the microdrive and the actual depth of the small electrolytic lesions made via the tungsten electrodes.In anesthetized animals, stable single-unit recordings were obtained from 129 MGB cells and 135 cortical cells. For each animal, 5\u201318 cells were collected (mean 10 cells/animal). On average, spontaneous activity ranged from 0.01\u20135.3 spikes/s (median 0.58; mean 1.08 \u00b1 0.46); the responses at the best frequency ranged from 10.8\u201356.5 spikes/s (median 16.5; mean 18.5 \u00b1 5.7). Both in MGB and ACx, CF values ranged from 0.3\u201335 kHz (Fig. 21,1). Fewer cortical cells were tuned to low frequencies (<1 kHz), but the two distributions did not significantly differ (\u03c72 = 1.25; ns). Note that in primary ACx, cells with a CF <1 kHz are located rostrally (Wallace et al., 2000), in an area in which large blood vessels make long-lasting (>40 min) single-unit recordings particularly difficult to achieve.Characteristics of the recorded cells on presentation of pure tones in the auditory thalamus (), the auditory cortex of anesthetized animals (), and the auditory cortex of awake animals (). The distribution of the characteristic frequency (CF) of cells did not differ between auditory thalamus (A1) and auditory cortex (B1) under anesthesia. In ACx, it did not differ between anesthetized (B1) and awake animals (C1). The tuning width quantified by the 20 dB was higher in the tonotopic (MGv) division of the auditory thalamus than in the nontonotopic (MGm and MGd) divisions (A2). They did not differ between cortical layers under anesthesia (B2) or in the awake condition (C2). The mean response latency was shorter in ventral auditory thalamus than in the dorsal and medial divisions (A3). It did not differ between cortical layers in anesthetized (B3) or awake (C3) condition. Under anesthesia, there was a tendency for longer latencies in the superficial layers (I/II) and shorter latencies in the deep layer (VI), but this effect was not significant.In the MGB, the location of most of the cells relative to the MGB divisions was determined. On average, cells of the ventral MGB displayed sharper tuning curves (higher 20 dB) and shorter response latencies (Fig. 22,3). In the ACx, cells were recorded from 320 to 1850 \u03bcm below the pia. Each cell was assigned to a cortical layer using the deep coordinates recently determined in the guinea pig ACx by Wallace and Palmer (2008). The sharpness of the tuning curves (Fig. 22) and the response latency (Fig. 23) did not significantly differ between cortical layers (ANOVA, lowest value  = 0.22).In awake animals, stable recordings from unambiguously isolated single units were obtained from 119 cortical cells (9\u201315 cells/animal, 3\u20134 recording sessions/animal, 3\u20135 cells/session). During each recording session, only one single unit was isolated from the signal obtained via a given electrode and only 1\u20133 electrodes (of 5\u20138 electrodes) produced signals allowing single-unit isolation. The CF of recorded cells ranged from 0.9\u201335 kHz (Fig. 21); the distribution did not significantly differ from that in the ACx of anesthetized animals (\u03c72 < 1; ns). Spontaneous firing rate ranged from 0.1 to 11.6 spikes/s (median 1.32, mean 2.25 \u00b1 0.25) and was significantly higher than in anesthetized animals (unpaired  test,  < 0.01). The strength of evoked responses at the best frequency ranged from 15.3\u201370.5 spikes/s (mean 27.5 \u00b1 9.1), which was not significantly different from that in the anesthetized animals (unpaired  test,  = 0.15). Figure 2, 2 and C3, shows the laminar distribution of the sharpness of tuning and the response latency; there was no statistical difference between layers (ANOVA, lowest value  = 0.15).Although all the cells included in the analyses displayed clear responses to pure tones, not all of them displayed reliable responses to vocalizations. Depending on the vocalization, the percentage of responsive cells (see Materials and Methods for definition) varied between 29 to 57%. Except for the purr, the percentages of responsive cells did not differ between MGB and ACx (Table 1). The percentages of responsive cells obtained in the ACx of awake animals were similar to those obtained in anesthetized animals (all \u03c72 values <1, ns). The following paragraphs focus on responsive cells, but analyses of the cells classified as nonresponsive are presented below.Numbers and percentages of cells (1) that were considered \u2033responsive\u2033 to each vocalization, (2) that carried information about each vocalization (vs its backward version), and (3) that carried information based on the temporal organization of the spike trainsFor most of the cells, when strong evoked responses were obtained on presentation of the natural vocalization, robust responses were also obtained on presentation of the time-reversed vocalization. Figure 3 displays rasters obtained on presentation of the natural and time-reversed versions of the four vocalizations for one MGB cell (Fig. 3), one ACx cell recorded under anesthesia (Fig. 3), and one ACx cell recorded in the awake condition (Fig. 3). These three cells responded to the four vocalizations and their responses were just as vigorous to the time-reversed versions as to the natural versions.Examples of single-unit responses obtained from anesthetized animals in the auditory thalamus () and auditory cortex (), and from awake animals in auditory cortex (). For each cell, the raster displays the responses to the natural version (top, 20 repetitions) and the time-reversed version (bottom, 20 repetitions) of the vocalizations. The oscillogram of the vocalizations is presented below each raster. Note that for each cell, the firing rates on presentation of the natural and time-reversed vocalizations were virtually identical. Note also that striking temporal patterns of discharge were observed on presentation of natural and time-reversed vocalizations. The waveform of the action potential (30 sweeps) obtained during the first (left) and last (right) trials is presented for each cell.The distributions of the selectivity index  (see Materials and Methods) at the thalamic and cortical levels are presented in Figure 4 for each vocalization. None of these distributions differ from a normal distribution centered on zero (in all cases \u03c72 < 1; ns). For each stimulus, \u201cselective\u201d cells exhibiting high positive or negative  values (d >0.8) were rare, and similar numbers of cells responded more vigorously to the natural or to the time-reversed version. The distributions obtained in MGB and ACx were not significantly different (\u03c72; lowest value,  = 0.14). In contrast, the distributions obtained in awake and anesthetized animals were significantly different (\u03c72, highest  value for the chirp,  = 0.03): the distributions of  values were more concentrated around zero in awake animals, and none of the cells recorded in the awake conditions exhibited a high  value for either the natural or the time-reversed vocalizations.Distribution of the selectivity index () for each vocalization and each condition. Each histogram shows the distribution of the selectivity index () for a particular vocalization over the whole population of thalamic () or cortical (, ) cells. A  value of 1 (\u22121) indicates that a neuron responded only to the natural (reversed) call; 0 means no firing-rate difference between natural and reversed calls. None of the distributions differed from a normal distribution centered around a mean of zero. Note that the values obtained for the cells recorded in awake animals were more concentrated around a mean of zero.The metric-space analysis was applied to spike trains of all recorded cells in the MGB and ACx. The responses of a given cell to a given vocalization were classified as \u201crate responses\u201d or as \u201ctemporal responses\u201d depending on the temporal precision (*max) value that provided the maximal amount of information (*max).Figure 5 presents examples of rate responses from four different cells. The rasters show that each cell responded only to either the natural (Fig. 51,1) or the time-reversed (Fig. 52,2) version of the stimulus. In the right column of Figure 5, the amount of transmitted information is plotted for a temporal precision  ranging from 0 to 10\u22125 s\u22121 in logarithmic steps. On such curves, the point at which * reaches its highest value (*max) indicates the extent to which a correct discrimination between stimuli can be achieved by looking at the spike trains, and the temporal precision with which this discrimination is achieved (*max). For all these curves, * reached its highest value (between 0.49 and 0.85 for these examples) for *max = 0, indicating that information was maximal when only spike count was considered. For these cells, as  increases (and 1/ decreased), the value of * gradually decreased, indicating that spike timing did not provide a better discrimination between natural and time-reversed vocalizations.Raster plots and transmitted information for four cells exhibiting \u201crate responses.\u201d For each cell, the raster shows the responses to 20 repetitions of the natural version (left column) and the time-reversed version (middle column) of a vocalization. The curves of the right column show the transmitted information as a function of the temporal precision (1/). In these four cases the highest value of information (*max) is achieved when no temporal precision is required ( = 0), and when  increases (1/ decreases) the information rapidly declines and reaches values close to zero. The waveform of the action potential (30 sweeps) obtained during the first (left) and last (right) trials is presented for each cell.For most of the cells exhibiting significant values of *max (i.e., positive value of [max \u2212 (bias + 2 SD)]), the responses were classified as \u201ctemporal responses.\u201d Figure 6 presents six examples of temporal responses: temporal organization of evoked discharges emerged during an equivalent firing rate to natural and time-reversed stimuli. As shown in the last column of Figure 6, in all cases, * increased as  increases (and 1/ decreased) up to a particular value of , which indicated that the natural and reversed vocalizations produce different temporal patterns and that these differences were sufficiently reliable to discriminate between the two stimuli, whereas the firing rate was not.Raster plots and transmitted information for cells exhibiting \u201ctemporal responses.\u201d For each cell, the raster shows the responses to 20 repetitions of the natural version (left column) and the time-reversed version (middle column) of a vocalization. The curve of the right column shows the transmitted information as a function of the temporal precision (1/). Note that the value of transmitted information is low when no temporal precision is considered ( = 0) and that the highest value of information (*max) is achieved for a particular value of 1/; then the information rapidly declines and reaches values close to zero. Note also that in all cases, the values of 1/ corresponding to *max are in the range of tens of milliseconds. The waveform of the action potential (30 sweeps) obtained during the first (left) and last (right) trials is presented for each cell.A large majority of responsive cells (exhibiting clear evoked responses based on the rasters and post stimulus time histograms) were informative cells, i.e., cells for which the information value *max was significantly positive. Table 1 presents for each stimulus type, and each condition, the percentage of responsive cells, of informative cells, and of temporal cells, i.e., cells for which spike timing carries more information than spike count. Overall, the percentage of informative cells (cells that carried a significant amount of information for the four vocalizations) did not differ between MGB and ACx (\u03c72 < 1; ns). A large majority of informative cells were temporal cells and the overall percentage of such cells did not differ between the MGB and ACx (\u03c72 = 2.13;  = 0.14). Among the responsive cells, the overall percentage of informative cells did not differ between the anesthetized and awake conditions in ACx (\u03c72 = 1.97;  = 0.16). In contrast, there was a globally higher proportion of temporal cells in the population of cells recorded in the awake condition compared with the anesthetized condition (\u03c72 = 6.56;  = 0.01). The effect was present for each vocalization (Table 1).Figure 7 presents, for all responsive cells, the value of *max as a function of *count for each vocalization and each condition. The dots located on the diagonal lines correspond to \u201crate responses,\u201d i.e., cases for which *max = *count. For each scattergram, most of the dots are located above the diagonal line (*max > *count), which means that taking the temporal precision into account increased the amount of transmitted information. In awake animals, the *count values are quite small, whereas the *max values are similar to those obtained in anesthetized animals, which leads, for all stimuli, to clusters of dots around the vertical line corresponding to *count = 0. Table 2 presents the mean values of *count and *max for each stimulus, each structure, and each condition. Under anesthesia, the mean value of *count, *max, and *max obtained for the four vocalizations did not differ between MGB and ACx. In contrast, the mean *count values obtained in the ACx of awake animals were lower than those obtained in anesthetized animals (ANOVA,  < 0.02); in fact, information carried by spike count was almost null in awake animals. There was a significant interaction between type of stimulus and condition ( < 0.01): For the two shorter stimuli (chirp and whistle), the mean *max values obtained in awake animals were lower than those obtained in anesthetized animals ( < 0.01). The reverse was true for the two longer stimuli (purr and chutter): the mean *max value was higher in the awake than in the anesthetized animals. This suggests that, in awake animals, temporal discharge patterns can underlie stimuli discrimination if the stimuli are at least a few hundred milliseconds in duration.Scattergrams of the firing rate-based information versus the spike-timing-based information. For each stimulus and each structure and condition, the scattergrams represent the highest value of information when spike timing is considered (*max) as a function of the information obtained when only the firing rate is considered (*count). In each scattergram, the points on the diagonal line correspond to \u201crate responses\u201d and the points above the diagonal line to \u201ctemporal responses.\u201d For the four vocalizations and in the three conditions, a large number of cells displayed *count values equal or close to zero, whereas the *max values spread over the entire -axis. In awake animals, these cells were so numerous that clusters of points generate a vertical line pattern.Mean value of count and max for the informative cells and for the temporal informative cellsFor a vast majority of the cells, visual examination of the rasters indicated that the temporal organization occurring on presentation of the time-reversed vocalization was not the mirror image of the one obtained with the natural vocalization (see examples in Figs. 3,, 6). To substantiate this observation, we reversed the spike trains collected on presentation of the time-reversed stimuli and, after shifting these reversed spike trains by the response latency, we recomputed the information between these new sets of spike trains and those obtained from the natural stimuli. This analysis was performed for all cells that did not exhibit a pure onset response (for this reason, the responses to the chirp were discarded). For most of the cells (>75%), *max was not decreased but rather increased after this inversion (e.g., lowest  value = 0.042 for the purr). This means that reversing and shifting the spike train obtained from the time-reversed vocalization produced a spike train that differs more from the spike train obtained from the natural vocalization than does the original spike train obtained from the reversed vocalization.The metric-space method indicated that high values of information were obtained when temporal discharge patterns were considered, but use of this method did not indicate whether temporal regularities existed for the natural stimulus, its time-reversed version, or both. Quantification of spike-timing reliability using the corr index allowed for the presence of temporal regularities to be assessed. For each vocalization, the corr,mean was similar for the responses to natural and to time-reversed stimuli (Fig. 8). An ANOVA indicated no effect of the factor \u201cdirection of the stimulus\u201d ((1,297) = 1.24;  = 0.27). The chirp used in our study provided higher corr,mean values than the other vocalizations, but this was most likely because of the different length of the vocalizations. Except for the chirp, the vocalizations lasted long enough to compute the corr,mean value obtained over many periods of time, which attenuates the high spike-timing reliability obtained at some time points. For the chirp (the one used here as well as any chirps of similar duration), only two values were available, and as the chirp often produced very reliable onset responses, this led to high corr values that were not balanced by lower values when computing the corr,mean value. When we considered the maximal values, corr,max, obtained for each stimulus with a temporal sliding window, the values obtained for the chirp used here were not different (and somewhat lower) than the maximal values obtained for the other vocalizations (0.82 for the chirp, vs 0.87, 0.95, and 0.91 for the purr, chutter, and whistle, respectively). Note that when cells ( = 49) recorded in awake conditions were tested with different samples of a particular vocalization type (e.g., the chutter), similar corr,mean values were obtained (see supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Note also that choosing a value of 10 ms for the Gaussian filter, \u03c3, allowed us to detect increases or decreases in the corr,mean value (see supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).Average corr,mean values obtained for each vocalization and each condition. The temporal reliability of neuronal responses at presentation of the natural and time-reversed vocalization was quantified by the corr index (Schreiber et al., 2003) (see Materials and Methods). For each vocalization and each condition, the corr,mean was computed with a temporal window of 80 ms shifted by 10 ms. There was no difference between cortex and thalamus in anesthetized conditions regardless of the vocalization. For the two longer stimuli (purr and chutter), the corr,mean values obtained in the awake conditions were higher than those obtained under anesthesia, but this effect was not observed for the two shorter stimuli (chirp and whistle).The corr,mean values did not differ between cortex and MGB (Fig. 8). The corr,mean value was higher in the awake condition than in the anesthetized condition for the longer stimuli (purr and chutter). An ANOVA revealed a significant effect of the conditions ( < 0.01) with no effect of the stimulus direction ( = 0.25).  analyses revealed a significant difference between the anesthetized and awake conditions ( = 0.01), but not between MGB and cortex under anesthesia ( = 0.35).On the one hand, the metric-space method indicated that for the four stimuli, the two structures (MGB and ACx) and the two conditions (anesthetized and awake), high values of information were obtained when spike timing was considered. However, the corr,mean values indicated that temporal organizations existed both on presentation of the natural and the time-reversed vocalizations. Although both of these measures depend on spike timing, they do not quantify the same aspects of spike train organization. Indeed, the metric-space method relies on a comparison between spike trains elicited by different stimuli whereas corr quantifies the spike-timing reliability for the responses to each stimulus. A positive correlation between these two quantifications would therefore indicate that the temporal organization of spike trains emerges during presentation of both stimuli and the higher their temporal reliability (corr), the better their ability to discriminate the stimuli (*max).The scattergrams presented in Figure 9 show that for the two longer stimuli (purr and chutter), there was a correlation between the *max and corr,mean values. Except for the values obtained in the ACx under anesthesia on the presentation of purr ( = 0.14, ns), these relations were significant ( < 0.05). There was no correlation for the chirp (highest value  = 0.11; ns), and for the whistle there was an overall correlation that was not significant in all conditions (it was only significant in ACx under anesthesia). The correlations indicate that, provided the stimulus is long enough, the higher the spike-timing reliability the higher the amount of information carried by temporal discharge patterns. Temporal regularities occurring too briefly do not necessarily provide high information values.Relationship between the corr,mean value and the value of transmitted information based on the spike-timing *max. For the two longer vocalizations (purr = 700 ms; chutter = 1740 ms), the scattergrams represent the corr values as a function of the *max values. Except for the data obtained in auditory cortex in anesthetized animals, there was a relationship between the two variables: for a given cell, the higher the corr, the higher the *max.At the thalamic level, the different MGB divisions showed similar proportions of cells responding to the four vocalizations, suggesting that lemniscal and nonlemniscal MGB had similar proportions of cells responding to conspecific vocalizations (see also Philibert et al., 2005). The percentage of dorsal MG (MGd) cells displaying a significant amount of information was systematically lower than in the medial MG (MGm) and in the ventral MG (MGv). For example, this effect was significant for the purr (\u03c72,  = 0.04 for MGd vs MGm and MGd vs MGv). The effect was also significant when considering cells that exhibited significant amounts of information for all vocalizations (2/27 cells in MGd vs 12/39 cells in MGv and 7/20 cells in MGm; \u03c72,  < 0.02 for MGd vs MGv and  < 0.04 for MGd vs MGm).At the cortical level, no statistical differences were found for the between-layer comparisons. The proportions of cells responsive to the four vocalizations did not differ between the different layers. For all types of vocalization, the percentage of \u201cinformative\u201d cells was comparable in each layer (\u03c72; lowest  value = 0.09). Last, the percentage of \u201ctemporal\u201d cells was higher in layer V than in the superficial layers for the whistle (\u03c72;  = 0.02) and for the purr (\u03c72;  = 0.06), but there was no significant effect for the other two vocalizations.Surprisingly, the metric-space analysis revealed that a non-negligible percentage of cells classified as nonresponsive (exhibiting evoked discharges in <10 of 20 trials) had significantly positive *max values. This finding suggests that, despite their poor firing rate, these cells displayed some temporal regularities in their spike trains that differed for the natural and time-reversed vocalizations. Figure 10 shows the rasters of three of these cells. These temporal regularities are less prominent than those observed in responsive cells, but they are sufficient to generate significantly positive *max values. Figure 10 presents the mean *max and *count values for the responsive and nonresponsive cells. Whatever the vocalization was, the *max values for the nonresponsive cells were as high, or even higher, than the *count values for the responsive cells. This result suggests that selecting cells based only on the strength of the evoked discharges probably provides an underestimation of the number of cells whose spike trains contained a significant amount of information about the stimuli.Individual examples and group data for the nonresponsive cells. , Raster plots showing the lack of reliable responses for cells classified as \u201cnonresponsive.\u201d In each case, the raster shows that despite the fact that the cell was responding in <10 of 20 of trials, when responses were emitted, the action potentials occurred during particular temporal windows that differed between natural and time-reversed vocalizations. , Group data showing, for each vocalization, the mean value of transmitted information for the informative and temporal cells classified either as \u201cresponsive\u201d (left two columns) or as \u201cnonresponsive\u201d (right two columns). The black bars represent the *max value (when spike timing is considered), the open bars represent the *count values (when only the firing rate is considered). Note that the *max values obtained for the \u201cnonresponsive\u201d cells were as high as (or higher than) the *count values obtained for the responsive cells.The vast majority of MGB and ACx cells recorded in anesthetized and awake guinea pigs displayed a similar evoked firing rate to natural and time-reversed conspecific vocalizations. Only a few cells produced spike trains whose firing rate carried a significant amount of information. However, for a large proportion of cells, the temporal organization of neural discharges carried more information than did spike count. Quantification of the spike-timing reliability revealed that there was no difference between natural and time-reversed vocalizations and no difference between MGB and ACx cells, but there were differences between awake and anesthetized conditions: for the two longer vocalizations, spike-timing reliability was higher in awake animals than in anesthetized animals.The metric-space analysis only applies to spike trains obtained from stimuli of equal duration. Thus, we could not determine whether the firing rate or temporal organization of neuronal discharges differed between the four different vocalizations used here. Nevertheless, comparison of the firing rate and spike patterns obtained on presentation of vocalizations with such different durations (from 90 to 1740 ms) and spectral content is almost trivial: any cell in the central auditory system can provide the neuronal basis for discriminating between these vocalizations based on their duration and spectral content. Discriminating between stimuli with similar durations and similar energies in the frequency bands (i.e., the natural and time reversed stimuli used here) is a more difficult task for which spike timing provides a more reliable neural basis than firing rate.In our study, single-unit recordings were not collected in secondary auditory areas. Using natural and time-reversed conspecific vocalizations in cat, Gour\u00e9vitch and Eggermont (2007) observed differences between primary and nonprimary areas (posterior ectosylvian gyrus): neurons exhibiting sustained responses in AI showed no preference for natural calls whereas neurons in posterior ectosylvian gyrus did. Because our recordings were collected only in tonotopic areas, the existence of a potential gradient from a temporal to a rate code in the hierarchy of auditory cortical areas remains to be investigated. Note, however, that in the auditory thalamus no differences were detected between tonotopic and nontonotopic areas in terms of both number of cells bearing information based on temporal patterns and spike-timing reliability quantified by the corr index.In songbird, intensive research has long focused on the neuronal responses to the BOS in different brain areas (review in Margoliash, 1997; Doupe and Kuhl, 1999; Prather and Mooney, 2004; Nealen and Schmidt, 2002). Selectivity for the BOS is weak in the avian homolog of primary auditory cortex (field L), but is robust in the HVC and NIf nuclei (Margoliash, 1986; Lewicki and Arthur, 1996; Janata and Margoliash, 1999; Cardin and Schmidt, 2004; Coleman and Mooney, 2004). In field L (and also in the caudal mesopallium), however, neurons respond preferentially to conspecific songs over synthetic sound ensembles designed to mimic the power spectra and amplitude modulation spectra of natural songs (see also Langner et al., 1981; Grace et al., 2003). These data suggest that, in songbirds, ACx neurons respond preferentially to conspecific sounds.In mammals, initial studies performed in the monkey ACx indicated that, based on firing rate, most cells (i) were not selective for a particular vocalization and (ii) responded similarly to the natural and time-reversed versions of vocalizations (Wollberg and Newman, 1972; Glass and Wollberg, 1983a,b; Pelleg-Toiba and Wollberg, 1991). In contrast, results obtained by Wang and colleagues in marmoset suggested that ACx neurons exhibit a firing rate preference for the natural version of conspecific calls (Wang et al., 1995), whereas when the same stimuli are presented to another species, the ACx neurons do not show this preference (Wang and Kadia, 2001). Our results are consistent with those obtained in the cat primary ACx (Gehr et al., 2000; Gour\u00e9vitch and Eggermont, 2007), indicating that there is no firing rate preference for the natural version of conspecific stimuli. In the present study, very few thalamic and cortical cells (1\u201310%) showed a preference for the natural versions of the conspecific calls, and an equal proportion of cells showed a preference for the time-reversed versions. One might have assumed that testing cells under general anesthesia would interfere with the detection of a preference for the natural (behaviorally meaningful) version of the vocalizations, but, interestingly, the present results argued against this possibility. First, in terms of firing rate, neurons recorded in awake animals systematically showed similar responses to natural and time-reversed vocalizations (Fig. 4). Second, in terms of information content, there were more temporal responses, i.e., responses for which information is higher when spike timing is considered, in awake animals than in anesthetized animals (Table 1). Thus, in the thalamocortical auditory system of the awake animal, the neuronal bases for discriminating between natural and time-reversed vocalizations should rely on temporal discharge patterns.In the visual modality, the temporal precision of neural discharges at the thalamic and cortical levels has been evaluated by several teams. A high temporal resolution (in the millisecond range) was initially found at the thalamic level on the presentation of sequences of image frames with a fluctuating luminance (Reinagel and Reid, 2000, 2002), but primary visual cortex (V1) neurons also fired with high precision on the presentation of visual stimuli (Kara et al., 2002; Kumbhani et al., 2007) (for review, see Tiesinga et al., 2008). Use of the metric-space method showed that the temporal organization of spike trains allowed for better discrimination of visual stimuli than firing rate, both in V1 (Victor and Purpura, 1996; Mechler et al., 1998) and V2 (Victor and Purpura, 1996). Recent studies also demonstrated that, during presentation of natural visual stimuli, significant amounts of information are carried by spike timing with millisecond and submillisecond precision (Nemenman et al., 2008). The gradual disappearance of spike-timing precision during progression through the sensory system is a plausible concept, but reanalysis of spike trains from MT neurons with new techniques has revealed that these neurons display quite high temporal precision in their firing patterns (Fellous et al., 2004).In field L, mutual information computed on presentation of complex acoustic stimuli indicates that a large amount of information is carried by spike timing, with approximately one-half of the information accessible only at time resolutions of \u223c10 ms (Wright et al., 2002), a timescale that was optimal for neural discrimination of a conspecific song (Narayan et al., 2006). More recently, the evaluation of different candidate neural codes underlying song discrimination revealed that performance based on spike timing was higher than performance based on firing rate or interspike intervals (Wang et al., 2007). Last, in the bird telencephalic nucleus HVC, only 20% of the cells were classified as selective for the BOS based on firing rate, whereas among all the cells carrying information about the BOS and its time-reversed version, a large proportion (77%) could discriminate between the two versions based on the temporal information contained in the spike trains (Huetz et al., 2006).In the mammalian ACx, initial studies using artificial stimuli indicated that spike patterns contained significantly more information about stimulus location than firing rate, both in anesthetized (Middlebrooks et al., 1994, 1998; Furukawa and Middlebrooks, 2002) and awake animals (Mickey and Middlebrooks, 2003). Recently, however, several studies have stressed the importance of temporal patterns of ACx neurons for coding communication sounds. For example, on presentation of heterospecific vocalizations, the highest amount of information carried by spike patterns of ACx neurons was achieved at temporal resolutions between 10 and 20 ms and then the information content declined for temporal resolutions of 80 ms or greater (Schnupp et al., 2006). Similarly, information content about the identity of natural sounds was higher when quantified with temporal features of neuronal responses (such as the response latency, or binary patterns at a 4\u20138 ms resolution) than when quantified with spike count (Chechik et al., 2006). Consistent with the present study, Chechik et al. reported no difference in the average amount of information carried by spike trains of thalamic and cortical cells. In contrast, inferior colliculus neurons conveyed 2 to fourfold more information about the stimulus identity than ACx and MGB neurons, but they were more redundant than ACx and MGB neurons in the way they coded the stimulus identity (Chechik et al., 2006).If we assume that neurons are simple linear bandpass filters, action potentials should be emitted each time the vocalizations contain energy in a particular frequency band (but note that spectrotemporal receptive fields of ACx neurons can be quite sluggish, i.e., the temporal component of the spectrotemporal response field can be quite slow). The response nonlinearities, however, might be more prominent in higher auditory centers and some results suggest that ACx neurons respond to the higher order statistics of a stimulus (Machens et al., 2004; Ahrens et al., 2008). Here, the analyses performed after inverting the spike trains obtained for time-reversed vocalizations allowed us to reject the possibility that the temporal discharge patterns were simply the consequences of a phase-locking on the stimulus envelope. Actually, data obtained by Heil and Irvine (Heil, 1997a,b; Heil and Irvine, 1996, 1998) indicate that rather than the envelope, it is the maximum acceleration of the peak pressure (i.e., the second derivative of a tone's envelope) that is responsible for the latency and the jitter of the first-spike response. In addition, ACx neurons can synchronize their discharges on the fine-structure of complex acoustic stimuli, responding not only to sound onset but also to the stimulus fine-structure with a precision of a few milliseconds (Elhilali et al., 2004, 2005). Therefore, the spike-timing precision observed on presentation of conspecific vocalizations can reflect a general mechanism for tracking rapid changes in peak pressure contained in most natural stimuli. This might explain why auditory thalamocortical neurons respond in a highly nonlinear manner, producing very different responses to small artificial modifications of a natural sound (Bar-Yosef et al., 2002; for review, see Nelken, 2004). Indeed, a large amount of information in the natural acoustic environment is carried by energy transients and this is particularly true for speech (Drullman, 1995; Shannon et al., 1995) and animal communication sounds. Hence, even if auditory cortex neurons do not process conspecific vocalizations differently from other natural sounds, they do process these vocalizations with a high degree of fidelity, thus allowing transients to be encoded.Whichever acoustic features are responsible for the temporal discharge patterns, they must rely on precise and reliable mechanisms. Several mechanisms can contribute to the high spike-timing reliability of thalamocortical circuits (for review, see Tiesinga et al., 2008). First,  studies indicate that cortical neurons display temporal regularities during injection of fluctuating currents in the soma (Mainen and Sejnowski, 1995; Fellous et al., 2001), suggesting that intrinsic membrane properties support high temporal fidelity. Second, recent studies suggest that auditory thalamocortical transmission is also temporally precise: the monosynaptic EPSPs triggered by thalamic stimulation in regular spiking and fast spiking cells from layers 3/4 can follow at rates of up to 40 Hz (Rose and Metherate, 2005). Third, the precise spiking pattern of ACx cells is often viewed as resulting from the precise temporal integration of excitatory and inhibitory potentials. Indeed, if inhibitory inputs are slightly delayed in time, ACx cells can emit action potentials during very brief temporal windows (Wehr and Zador, 2003; Zhang et al., 2003). Regardless of the contribution of these different mechanisms, they are not specific to cortical circuits because similar spike-timing precision is observed at the thalamic level. This is not surprising given that thalamic interneurons (Usrey and Reid, 1999) and thalamic reticular neurons (Cotillon-Williams et al., 2008) sculpt the temporal response of thalamic relay cells as cortical interneurons do in sensory cortices.The central question addressed by this study was how neural spike trains can discriminate a natural stimulus with a strong behavioral meaning for the animal's daily social interactions from a stimulus with a similar spectral and temporal content, but no behavioral relevance. Our results clearly indicate that temporal discharge patterns can provide the cellular basis for such a discrimination, whereas the firing rate cannot.Two previous studies in mammals indicated that spike timing is more efficient than firing rate for coding the behavioral relevance of vocalizations. For example, compared with responses recorded in the ACx of pup-naive females, the neuronal responses to pup calls obtained from mothers were not stronger in terms of firing rate but, at a 2 ms resolution, they contained more information about the detection and discrimination of pup calls (Liu and Schreiner, 2007). This effect was not observed for non-natural sounds falling outside the mouse vocalization repertoire. In another study, compared with the neuronal responses recorded from naive ferrets, the responses recorded in the ACx in ferrets that received discrimination training in a Go/NoGo task were not stronger for the conditioned stimulus, but they contained more information based on temporal discharge patterns expressed at timescales of 10\u201350 ms (Schnupp et al., 2006).Obviously, reproducible spike-patterns observed at the single cell level cannot by themselves represent the neuronal basis of auditory perception, but their synchronization in neuronal ensembles is certainly a key element for the intercolumnar and interstructural communication (for review, see Tiesinga et al., 2008). The similar temporal pattern precision during natural and time-reversed vocalizations in the present study also argues against the existence of neurons that selectively express temporal organization for natural vocalizations that the animals are exposed to daily. Rather, our data indicate that different temporal discharge patterns are triggered by natural and artificial stimuli with the same spectral content. These temporal patterns are probably the reflection of transient neuronal assemblies that provide the neuronal bases of auditory perception.This work was partially supported by Grant ANRNeuro2006 to J.-M.E.

Subsequent reexposure to the CS alone triggers two competing processes. Brief reexposure to the CS initiates reconsolidation processes that serve to stabilize or maintain the original CS\u2013US memory. In contrast, more prolonged reexposure to the CS leads to the formation of an inhibitory extinction (CS\u2013no US) memory. Previous studies have established that both reconsolidation and extinction require gene expression. Consistent with this, here we first show that genetic disruption of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)-mediated transcription blocks both reconsolidation and long-term extinction of contextual fear memory. We next asked whether reconsolidation and extinction engage CREB-mediated transcription in distinct brain regions. Accordingly, we used immunohistochemical approaches to characterize the activation of the transcription factor CREB [as well as the expression of the CREB-dependent gene Arc (activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein)] after brief versus prolonged reexposure to a previously conditioned context. After brief reexposure, we observed significant activation of CREB-mediated gene expression in the hippocampus and amygdala. In contrast, after the prolonged reexposure, we observed significant activation of CREB-mediated gene expression in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. Finally, we showed that blocking protein synthesis in either the hippocampus or the amygdala blocked reconsolidation of contextual fear memory, whereas similar blockade in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex prevented the formation of extinction memory. These experiments establish that reactivated contextual fear memories undergo CREB-dependent reconsolidation or extinction in distinct brain regions.To generate long-term memory, short-term memory undergoes a gene expression-dependent stabilization process known as memory consolidation (Flexner et al., 1965; Davis and Squire, 1984; McGaugh, 2000). Although it was previously thought that this consolidation occurs just once, there is growing evidence that memory retrieval is a dynamic process that can either reinforce or alter memory (Misanin et al., 1968; Schneider and Sherman, 1968; Lewis, 1979; Mactutus et al., 1979; Przybyslawski and Sara, 1997; Nader et al., 2000; Sara, 2000).The fate of a retrieved memory appears to depend, in part, on the nature of the retrieval episode. In fear-conditioning paradigms, for example, blocking protein synthesis before or immediately after brief reexposure to the conditioning stimulus (CS) alone disrupts the subsequent expression of the fear memory (Nader et al., 2000; Debiec et al., 2002; Kida et al., 2002; Suzuki et al., 2004). Such experiments have led to the idea that the reactivated fear memory is destabilized and then restabilized through a gene expression-dependent reconsolidation process (Nader et al., 2000; Taubenfeld et al., 2001; Debiec et al., 2002; Kida et al., 2002). In contrast, more prolonged reexposure to the CS leads to extinction of the fear memory (Pavlov, 1927; Rescorla, 2001; Myers and Davis, 2002). Similar to reconsolidation, this retrieval-initiated process appears to depend on new gene expression because blockade of protein synthesis before prolonged reexposure blocks the formation of an extinction memory [i.e., a new CS\u2013no unconditioned stimulus (US) inhibitory memory that competes with the original CS\u2013US memory trace] (Berman and Dudai, 2001; Vianna et al., 2001).Together, these studies indicate that retrieval of a fear memory initiates two processes, reconsolidation and extinction, that have distinct temporal signatures (Eisenberg et al., 2003; Pedreira and Maldonado, 2003; Suzuki et al., 2004). Recent studies have also begun to suggest that these two processes are partially dissociable at the neurochemical level. For example, we showed that administration of either L-type voltage-gated calcium channels or CB1 receptor antagonists block extinction of contextual fear memory but have no effect on reconsolidation (Suzuki et al., 2004). In the current study, we ask whether reconsolidation and extinction are also dissociable at the anatomical level. We first showed that activation of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)-mediated transcription is necessary for both reconsolidation and long-term extinction of contextual fear memory. Next, we used immunohistochemical approaches to characterize the activation of the transcription factor CREB [as well as the expression of the CREB-dependent gene activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc)] after brief versus prolonged context reexposure. After brief reexposure, we observed significant activation of CREB-mediated gene expression in the hippocampus and amygdala. In contrast, after the prolonged reexposure, we observed significant activation of CREB-mediated gene expression in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that reconsolidation and extinction engage protein synthesis-dependent processes in distinct brain regions. Consistent with this, we finally showed that blocking protein synthesis in either the hippocampus or amygdala blocked reconsolidation of contextual fear memory, whereas similar blockade in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex prevented the formation of extinction memory.All experiments were conducted according to the  and the . Male C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River. Transgenic mice expressing an inducible CREB repressor (CREBIR mice) have been backcrossed to C57BL/6 (Kida et al., 2002; Suzuki et al., 2008). Mice were housed in cages of five or six, maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle, and allowed  access to food and water. Mice were at least 8 weeks of age when tested. Testing was performed during the light phase of the cycle. All experiments were conducted blind to the treatment condition of the mouse.Mice were trained and tested in conditioning chambers (17.5 \u00d7 17.5 \u00d7 15 cm) that had a stainless steel grid floor through which footshocks could be delivered (Suzuki et al., 2004, 2008). Training consisted of placing the mice in the chamber and delivering an unsignaled footshock (2 s duration, 0.4 mA) 148 s later. Mice were returned to the homecage 30 s after the footshock (training).For the first experiment, we examined the effects of disrupting CREB function on memory reconsolidation and extinction using transgenic mice that express an inducible CREB repressor (CREBIR) in the forebrain, where a dominant-negative CREB protein is fused with the ligand binding domain of a mutant estrogen receptor (ER). Previous studies have shown that systemic injection of tamoxifen, the artificial ligand for ER, into these transgenic mice inhibits CREB activity in the forebrain (Kida et al., 2002). Twenty-four hours after the training session, CREBIR and wild-type (WT) mice were placed back in the training context for 3 or 30 min, during which time freezing behavior was assessed (reexposure) as the percentage of time mice spent freezing (defined as a complete lack of movement, except for respiration). Mice were administered an intraperitoneal injection of 16 mg/kg 4-hydroxytamoxifen (TAM; Sigma), which was dissolved in 10 ml of peanut oil (Sigma) or vehicle (VEH; a similar volume of peanut oil) 6 h before the reexposure (Kida et al., 2002). Twenty-four hours after the reexposure session, mice were once again placed in the training context (5 min), and freezing behavior was assessed (test). Freezing behavior was measured automatically (O'Hara & Co.) (Anagnostaras et al., 2001).For the second experiment (phosphorylated and total CREB immunocytochemistry), we examined the brain regions that are activated after reexposure to the CS (see Fig. 2). Before the commencement of contextual fear conditioning, mice were handled individually for 2 min each day for 1 week. Mice were divided into eight groups: (1) Recon-33 and -60, and Ext-33 and -60 groups; four (conditioned) groups of mice were trained as described above and 24 h later were reexposed to the context for either 3 min (Recon groups) or 30 min (Ext groups). The animals were then anesthetized with Nembutal (750 mg/kg, i.p.) 3 min (Ext-33), 30 min (Recon-33, Ext-60), or 57 min (Recon-60) after the reexposure; (2) no US-33 and -60 groups; two (unconditioned) groups received a training session in the absence of footshock and 24 h later were reexposed to the context for either 3 min (no US-33) or 30 min (no US-60). The animals were then anesthetized, as above, 30 min after reexposure; and (3) no association-33 and -60 groups; the other two (unconditioned) groups were delivered a footshock 5 h after being placed in the conditioned chamber and returned to the homecage 30 s after the footshock. Twenty-four hours later, mice were reexposed to the context for either 3 min (no association-33) or 30 min (no association-60) and anesthetized, as above, 30 min after the reexposure. It is important to note that, in this experiment, the total length of time from the beginning of the reexposure to the anesthetization is 33 min (Recon-33, Ext-33, no US-33, no association-33) or 60 min (Recon-60, Ext-60, no US-60, no association-60). The Ext-33 and Recon-60 groups were used to compare the effects of the duration of reexposure on CREB activation with the Recon-33 and Ext-60 groups, respectively, using the identical time course from the beginning of the reexposure.For the third experiment (Arc immunocytochemistry), mice were trained as above in the presence or absence of a footshock and 24 h later were reexposed to the context for 3 or 30 min. The animals were anesthetized 90 min after the reexposure.For the fourth experiment, we examined the effects of inhibition of protein synthesis in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), hippocampus, and amygdala on memory reconsolidation and extinction. A protein synthesis inhibitor, anisomycin (ANI; Sigma), was dissolved in VEH solution, containing 3 drops of Tween 80 in 2.5 ml of 7.5% dimethylsulfoxide in artificial CSF, and adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. Mice were trained as above and 24 h later received intracranial injections of ANI (62.5 \u03bcg) immediately after the reexposure phase of 3 or 30 min. Twenty-four hours after the reexposure session, mice were once again placed in the training context (5 min), and freezing behavior was assessed. Infusions into each brain region (0.5 \u03bcl) were made at a rate of 0.25 \u03bcl/min. The injection cannula was left in place for 2 min after the infusion. This dose of locally infused ANI inhibits >90% of protein synthesis for at least 4 h (Rosenblum et al., 1993).After the anesthetization, mice were perfused with PBS/0.1 mm sodium fluoride (NaF) containing 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were then removed, fixed overnight, transferred to 30% sucrose, and stored at 4\u00b0C. Coronal sections (30 \u03bcm) were cut on a cryostat. After cutting the brain, sections were washed and preincubated in 3% H2O2 in methanol for 1 h, followed by incubation in blocking solution (PBS/0.1 mm NaF plus 1% goat serum albumin, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 0.05% Triton X-100) for 3 h. Consecutive sections were incubated with a polyclonal rabbit primary antibody for anti-phospho-CREB (S133; 1:1000; Upstate Biotechnology), anti-CREB (1:1000; Upstate Biotechnology), or anti-Arc (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in the blocking solution overnight. To measure CREB activation, consecutive sections were alternately incubated with anti-phospho-CREB or anti-CREB antibodies. Subsequently, sections were washed with PBS/0.1 mm NaF and incubated for 3 h at room temperature with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (SAB-PO kit; Nichirei Biosciences), followed by 1 h at room temperature in the streptavidin\u2013biotin\u2013peroxidase complex (SAB-PO kit). Structures were anatomically defined according to the atlas of Franklin and Paxinos (1997). Quantification of phosphorylated CREB (pCREB)-, CREB-, or Arc-positive cells in sections (100 \u00d7 100 \u03bcm) of mPFC (bregma between 2.10 and 1.98 mm), amygdala (bregma between \u22121.22 and \u22121.34 mm), and dorsal hippocampus (bregma between \u22121.46 and \u22121.82 mm) was analyzed with a computerized image analysis system, as described previously (Winroof version 5.5 software; Mitani Corporation) (Frankland et al., 2006; Suzuki et al., 2008). Immunoreactive neurons were counted bilaterally with a fixed sample window across at least three sections by an experimenter blind to the treatment condition.CREB activation (relative pCREB/CREB levels) was calculated by normalizing the number of pCREB-positive cells to the total number of CREB-positive cells. Data of pCREB/CREB levels and Arc expression for each group were expressed as a percentage of the averaged values in the no US-33 control group (Kee et al., 2007).Surgeries were performed as described previously (Frankland et al., 2006; Suzuki et al., 2008). Under Nembutal anesthesia and using standard stereotaxic procedures, stainless steel guide cannulae (22 gauge) were implanted into the mPFC (2.7 mm, \u00b10 mm, \u22121.6 mm), the dorsal hippocampus (\u22121.8 mm, \u00b11.8 mm, \u22121.9 mm), or amygdala (\u22121.3 mm, \u00b13.3 mm, \u22124.4 mm). Mice were allowed to recover for at least 1 week after surgery. After this, they were handled for 1 week before the commencement of contextual fear conditioning.Data were analyzed with ANOVA. One-way and  Newman\u2013Keuls comparisons were used to analyze the effects of treatments, drugs, and genotypes on freezing responses. One- or two-way ANOVA followed by  Newman\u2013Keuls and  Bonferroni's comparisons, respectively, were used to analyze the effects of groups, times, and reexposure on CREB activation and Arc expression. Planned comparisons using a paired  test were used to analyze the differences of freezing scores from the contextual conditioning of each group between the first 5 min reexposure, during the 30 min reexposure, and test. Comparisons of within-session extinction using a paired  test and repeated ANOVA were used to analyze the effects of drug and genotype (Suzuki et al., 2004, 2008). All values in the text and figure legends are means \u00b1 SEM.The relationship between reconsolidation and extinction of fear memory has been investigated (Eisenberg et al., 2003; Pedreira and Maldonado, 2003; Suzuki et al., 2004). Our previous study demonstrated that inhibition of protein synthesis after a short reexposure (3 min) to the context disrupts the reactivated contextual fear memory, whereas a prolonged reexposure (30 min) followed by inhibition of protein synthesis blocked long-term extinction without disrupting the fear memory (Suzuki et al., 2004). These observations indicate that short and long reexposure triggers reconsolidation or extinction phases, respectively. In this study, to ask whether reconsolidation and extinction phases are dissociable at the anatomical level, we investigated brain regions regulating the reconsolidation and extinction phases.Previous studies have shown that CREB-mediated transcription is required for the consolidation and reconsolidation of contextual fear memory (Kida et al., 2002). However, little is known about whether transcriptional activation by CREB is required for memory extinction. Therefore, we first examined the roles of CREB-mediated transcription in the reconsolidation and extinction of contextual fear memory and then tried to investigate the brain regions where CREB is activated in the reconsolidation and extinction phases.To examine the effects of loss of function of CREB on reconsolidation and extinction, we used CREBIR transgenic mice (Kida et al., 2002). In these experiments, CREBIR and WT littermate controls were trained with a single footshock and 24 h later were reexposed to the context for 3 or 30 min. Six hours before the reexposure, mice received a systemic injection of TAM or VEH to induce the inhibition of CREB activity (Kida et al., 2002).In the reconsolidation experiment, all groups showed comparable levels of freezing during the 3 min reexposure (Fig. 1\n) (\n(3,44) = 0.15;  > 0.05). When the contextual fear memory was tested 24 h later, one-way ANOVA revealed a significant effect of group (Fig. 1\n) (\n(3,44) = 2.83;  < 0.05). The  Newman\u2013Keuls test showed that TAM-injected CREBIR mice significantly froze less compared with the other groups (Fig. 1\n) ( < 0.05). Consistent with previous observations, inhibition of CREB activity disrupted the reactivated fear memory, indicating that the contextual fear memory requires CREB-dependent memory for reconsolidation (Kida et al., 2002; Suzuki et al., 2008).Effects of disrupting CREB function on memory reconsolidation and extinction. \n\n, \n\n, Experimental design used with data presented below. \n\n, \n\n, Effects of disrupting CREB function on reconsolidation. \n\n, Freezing score during 3 min reexposure (WT/VEH,  = 13; CREBIR/VEH,  = 11; WT/TAM,  = 13; CREBIR/TAM,  = 11). \n\n, Freezing score during test session. \n\n, \n\n, Effects of disrupting CREB function on extinction. \n\n, Freezing score in 5 min blocks during 30 min reexposure (WT/VEH,  = 12; CREBIR/VEH,  = 15; WT/TAM,  = 14; CREBIR/TAM,  = 15). \n\n, Freezing score during test session were shown. \n\n, Summary of the relationship between the duration of reexposure and freezing score at test session (\n\n, \n\n). Error bars are SEM. * < 0.05, versus WT/VEH, WT/TAM, and CREBIR/VEH.We next examined the effects of disrupting CREB function on memory extinction. Overall freezing levels did not differ across groups during the 30 min reexposure (\n(3,52) = 2.42;  > 0.05) but did decrease over time in all groups (\n(5,260) = 74.2;  < 0.05) (Fig. 1\n). Measurements 24 h after this 30 min reexposure confirmed that the extinction of conditioned freezing was persistent in VEH-treated WT mice (first 5 min in the reexposure session vs test; \n(22) = 3.03;  < 0.05), indicating that long-term extinction occurred in these experimental conditions. In contrast, extinction tested 24 h after the 30 min reexposure was blocked by the inhibition of CREB function. One-way ANOVA across four groups revealed a significant effect of group (Fig. 1\n) (\n(3,52) = 5.32;  < 0.05). TAM-injected CREBIR mice showed significantly more freezing compared with the other groups (Fig. 1\n) ( < 0.05). Thus, these results indicate that CREB is required for long-term extinction.The effects of blocking CREB function on memory reconsolidation and extinction are summarized in Figure 1\n. These results indicate that activation of CREB-mediated transcription is required for both reconsolidation and long-term extinction. It is worth noting that although genetic inhibition of CREB activity blocked the formation of the new extinction memory, it presumably had no effect on the expression of the original fear memory. This observation is consistent with previous findings using systemic injection of ANI (Suzuki et al., 2004, 2008) and (1) confirms that reconsolidation and extinction of contextual fear memory have distinct temporal signatures and (2) suggests that these two processes interact.The transcription factor CREB is activated through phosphorylation at serine 133 by CREB kinases such as protein kinase A and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (Shaywitz and Greenberg, 1999; Mayr and Montminy, 2001). This phosphorylation is an essential step in the activation of CREB-mediated transcription (Gonzalez and Montminy, 1989; Ginty et al., 1994; Bito et al., 1996; Silva et al., 1998). Therefore, phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133 has been used to identify brain regions activated in gene expression-dependent memory processes (Viola et al., 2000; Hall et al., 200l).Therefore, to ask whether reconsolidation and extinction phases are dissociable at the anatomical level, we next performed immunohistochemical analysis to identify brain regions where CREB is activated in the reconsolidation and extinction phases. Reconsolidation of fear memory has been shown to be mediated by the amygdala (Nader et al., 2000; Duvarci and Nader, 2004; Tronel et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2006) and hippocampus (Debiec et al., 2002; Frankland et al., 2006; Suzuki et al., 2008). In contrast, extinction of the fear memory is thought to depend on the mPFC (Morgan et al., 1993; Morgan and LeDoux, 1995, 1999; Morrow et al., 1999; Quirk et al., 2000, 2006; Santini et al., 2004) and amygdala (Lee et al., 2001; Lu et al., 2001; Walker et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2006; Myers and Davis, 2007). From these findings, we focused our anatomical analyses on the mPFC, amygdala, and hippocampus.CREB activation was assessed as the ratio of pCREB to total CREB levels in four conditioned and four unconditioned groups (Fig. 2). The conditioned groups of mice were trained with a footshock and 24 h later were re-exposed to the context for 3 min (Recon groups) or 30 min (Ext groups). Recon groups were assessed for CREB activation 30 min (Recon-33 group) or 57 min (Recon-60 group) after the reexposure, whereas Ext groups were assessed for CREB activation 3 min (Ext-33 group) or 30 min (Ext-60 group) after the reexposure. Unconditioned groups were treated similarly, except either that they did not receive a footshock (no US groups) or that they stayed in the conditioned chamber for 5 h before receiving the footshock (no association groups) and were assessed for CREB activation 30 min after the reexposure for 3 min (no US-33 and no association-33 groups) or 30 min (no US-60 and no association-60 groups). It is important to note that the conditioned groups froze at equal levels during the 3 min reexposure and for the first 5 min of the 30 min reexposure (Recon-33, 56.4 \u00b1 5.2%; Recon-60, 58.3 \u00b1 3.4%; Ext-33, 57.6 \u00b1 4.5%; Ext-60, 59.2 \u00b1 4.1%), indicating that the contextual fear memory was reactivated. Longer (30 min) reexposure reduced freezing over time within the session in both the Ext-33 and Ext-60 groups (to 24.9 \u00b1 5.9 and 25.1 \u00b1 3.1%, respectively), indicating that within-session extinction occurred (overall freezing: \n(1.125) = 0.12,  > 0.05; decrease over time: \n(5,125 = 28.45,  < 0.05). In contrast, the unconditioned groups showed significantly lower freezing during the 3 min and the first 3 min of the long reexposure compared with the conditioned groups (data not shown).Experimental design. The experimental design to investigate changes in CREB activation in mPFC, hippocampus, and amygdala induced by reconsolidation or extinction phases is shown.We first analyzed CREB activation in the mPFC [including the prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) regions]. Our experiments revealed that CREB was activated in the extinction but not the reconsolidation phase. One-way ANOVA across the 3 min reexposure (reconsolidation) groups (Recon-33, Recon-60, no US-33, and no association-33) revealed no significant effect of group in the PL and IL regions (PL: \n(3,35) = 0.17,  > 0.05, IL: \n(3,35) = 0.12,  > 0.05), indicating that CREB was not activated in either of these mPFC regions in the reconsolidation phase (Fig. 3\n,). In contrast, one-way ANOVA across the 30 min reexposure (extinction) groups (Ext-33, Ext-60, no US-60, and no association-60) revealed significant effects of group in the PL and IL regions (Fig. 3\n,) (PL: \n(3,52) = 5.99,  < 0.05; IL: \n(3,52) = 6.25,  < 0.05). The  Newman\u2013Keuls test showed a significantly higher level of pCREB in both mPFC regions of the Ext-60 groups compared with the other groups (Fig. 3\n,) ( < 0.05). This result indicates that CREB was significantly activated in the PL and IL regions of the conditioned groups after the 30 min, but not 3 min, reexposure. We next compared the time course of CREB activation from the beginning of the reexposure (using the identical time schedule) among the conditioned groups (Recon-33, Recon-60, Ext-33, and Ext-60). Consistent with the above results, a two-way ANOVA with reexposure (3 vs 30 min) and time (from the beginning of reexposure; 33 vs 60 min) revealed significant reexposure versus time interactions (Fig. 3\n,) (reexposure vs time interaction; PL: \n(1,43) = 11.25,  < 0.05; IL: \n(1,43) = 6.08,  < 0.05). The  Bonferroni's test showed significantly higher activation of CREB in the Ext-60 group compared with the other groups ( < 0.05), indicating that CREB was activated in both mPFC regions 30 min after the 30 min reexposure (Fig. 3\n,). Thus, these observations indicate that CREB is activated in the PL and IL prefrontal regions when contextual fear memory is extinguished but not reconsolidated.Effects of the reexposure duration on CREB activation in the mPFC. \n\n, Representative PL pCREB-positive cell immunohistochemistry obtained from indicated mice. Scare bar, 100 \u03bcm. \n\n, \n\n, Effects of the 3 min reexposure duration on CREB activation in PL (\n\n) and IL (\n\n) regions of mPFC (Recon-33,  = 11; no US-33,  = 10; no association-33,  = 9; Recon-60,  = 9). \n\n, \n\n, Effects of the 30 min reexposure duration on CREB activation in PL (\n\n) and IL (\n\n) regions of mPFC (Ext-33,  = 10; no US-60,  = 15; no association-60,  = 14; Ext-60,  = 17). * < 0.05, compared with the other groups. \n\n, \n\n, Comparison of CREB activation after 3 and 30 min reexposure in PL (\n\n) and IL (\n\n) regions of mPFC in the conditioned group. Error bars are SEM. CREB activation (relative pCREB/CREB levels) was calculated by normalizing the number of pCREB-positive cells to the total CREB positive cells. Data of CREB activation for each group were expressed as the percentage of the averaged values in the no US-33 control group.We next analyzed the hippocampus. In contrast to the results for the mPFC, hippocampal CREB is activated in the reconsolidation but not extinction phase. One-way ANOVA across the 3 min reexposure groups revealed significant effects of group in the CA1 and CA3 but not the dentate gyrus (DG) regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 4\n) (CA1: \n(3,35) = 4.74,  < 0.05; CA3: \n(3,35) = 9.25,  < 0.05; DG: \n(3,35) = 0.80,  > 0.05).  analyses showed a significant higher level of pCREB in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the Recon-33 and Recon-60 groups compared with the other control groups ( < 0.05), indicating that CREB is activated in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions of the conditioned groups after a 3 min reexposure (Fig. 4\n). In contrast, no CREB activation was observed in these three regions of the hippocampus in the 30 min reexposure groups (CA1: \n(3,52) = 0.24,  > 0.05; CA3: \n(3,52) = 0.29,  > 0.05; DG: \n(3,52) = 0.52,  > 0.05), indicating that CREB is not activated in the hippocampus in the extinction phase (Fig. 4\n). Consistent with this, a two-way ANOVA across the conditioned groups followed by the  Bonferroni's test showed significantly higher activation of CREB in the CA1 and CA3 but not DG region of the Recon groups (Recon-33 and -60) compared with the Ext groups (Fig. 4\n) (reexposure vs time interaction; CA1: \n(1,43) = 0.03,  > 0.05; CA3: \n(1,43) = 0.09,  > 0.05; DG: \n(1,43) = 0.82,  > 0.05). These observations indicate that CREB is activated in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus when contextual fear memory is reconsolidated but not extinguished. Additionally, it is important to point out that CREB activation was not observed in the hippocampus in the extinction phase, although contextual fear memory was reactivated during the reexposure. This observation indicates that although short reexposure that triggers memory reconsolidation induces CREB activation in the hippocampus, this activation is suppressed when longer context reexposure that produces within-session extinction is used.Effects of the reexposure duration on CREB activation in the hippocampus. \n\n, Representative CA1 pCREB-positive cell immunohistochemistry obtained from indicated mice. Scare bar, 100 \u03bcm. \n\n, Effects of the 3 min reexposure duration on CREB activation in CA1 (\n\n), CA3 (\n\n) and DG (\n\n) regions of hippocampus (Recon-33,  = 11; no US-33,  = 10; no association-33,  = 9; Recon-60,  = 9). * < 0.05, compared with the unconditioned groups (no US-33 and no association-33). \n\n, Effects of the 30 min reexposure duration on CREB activation in CA1 (\n\n), CA3 (\n\n) and DG (\n\n) regions of hippocampus (Ext-33,  = 10; no US-60,  = 15; no association-60,  = 14; Ext-60,  = 17). \n\n, Comparison of CREB activation after 3 and 30 min reexposure in CA1 (\n\n), CA3 (\n\n), and DG (\n\n) regions of hippocampus in the conditioned group. Error bars are SEM. CREB activation was calculated by normalizing the number of pCREB-positive cells to the total CREB-positive cells. Data of CREB activation for each group were expressed as the percentage of the averaged values in the no US-33 control group.We finally analyzed the levels of pCREB in the amygdala. CREB was activated in the lateral (LA), basolateral (BLA), and central (Ce) regions of the amygdala in both the reconsolidation and extinction phases. One-way ANOVA across the 3 min or 30 min reexposure groups revealed significant effects of group in the three regions of the amygdala (Fig. 5\n) (LA: 3 min, \n(3,35) = 9.87,  < 0.05; 30 min, \n(3,52) = 7.26,  < 0.05; BLA: 3 min, \n(3,35) = 9.17,  < 0.05; 30 min, \n(3,52) = 7.20,  < 0.05; Ce: 3 min, \n(3,35) = 4.80,  < 0.05; 30 min, \n(3,52) = 8.48,  < 0.05). The level of pCREB was significantly increased in the three amygdaloid regions of the Recon-33, Recon-60, and Ext-60 groups compared with the other 3 or 30 min, respectively, reexposure control groups (Fig. 5\n) ( > 0.05). These results indicated that no CREB activation was observed 3 min after the 30 min reexposure in the conditioned extinction groups. Consistent with this, a two-way ANOVA across the conditioned groups revealed significant reexposure versus time interactions in these three regions of the amygdala (Fig. 5\n) (reexposure vs time interaction; LA: \n(1,43) = 7.60,  < 0.05; BLA: \n(1,43) = 6.60,  < 0.05; Ce: \n(1,43) = 5.71,  < 0.05). The  Bonferroni's test showed that the pCREB levels were significantly increased in the three amygdaloid regions of the Recon-33, Recon-60, and Ext-60 groups compared with the Ext-33 group (Fig. 5\n) ( < 0.05). Collectively, these observations indicate that CREB was activated in the amygdala when the fear memory was being reconsolidated and extinguished but showed a different time course from the beginning of the reexposure to the context between the reconsolidation and extinction phases. Extinction conditioned groups showed activation of CREB but also showed a delay of CREB activation compared with the reconsolidation group, although the contextual fear memory was reactivated in both groups. These differences in the time course of CREB activation between the reconsolidation and extinction groups indicates that CREB activation triggered by a 30 min reexposure is not simply attributable to the reactivation of the fear memory and, furthermore, that the mechanisms for the regulation of CREB activation differ in the reconsolidation and extinction phases.Effects of the reexposure duration on CREB activation in the amygdala. \n\n, Representative BLA pCREB-positive cell immunohistochemistry obtained from indicated mice. Scare bar, 100 \u03bcm. \n\n, Effects of the 3 min reexposure duration on CREB activation in LA (\n\n), BLA (\n\n), and Ce (\n\n) regions of amygdala (Recon-33,  = 11; no US-33,  = 10; no association-33,  = 9; Recon-60,  = 9). * < 0.05, compared with the unconditioned groups (no US-33 and no association-33). \n\n, Effects of the 30 min reexposure duration on CREB activation in LA (\n\n), BLA (\n\n) and Ce (\n\n) regions of amygdala (Ext-33,  = 10; no US-60,  = 15; no association-60,  = 14; Ext-60,  = 17). * < 0.05, compared with the other groups. \n\n, Comparison of CREB activation after 3 and 30 min reexposure in LA (\n\n), BLA (\n\n), and Ce (\n\n) regions of amygdala in the conditioned group. Error bars are SEM. CREB activation was calculated by normalizing the number of pCREB-positive cells to the total CREB-positive cells. Data of CREB activation for each group were expressed as the percentage of the averaged values in the no US-33 control group.As a control experiment, we examined CREB activation in the visual cortex. In contrast to the results in Figures 3\n\u21d1\u20135, no CREB activation was observed in the conditioned groups after the 3 and 30 min reexposure (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).In summary, our anatomical analyses suggest that activation of CREB in the hippocampus and amygdala contributes to the reconsolidation of the contextual fear memory, whereas this activation in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex contributes to the extinction.To ask whether the activation of CREB observed in Figures 3\n\u21d1\u20135 are reflected by the expression of a CREB-target gene, we measured the expression of the immediate-early gene Arc in the reconsolidation and extinction phases. Arc is a CREB-dependent gene (Kawashima et al., 2008), the expression of which is regulated by neuronal activity. Previous studies have shown that it is upregulated after contextual fear memory formation and retrieval (Guzowski et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2005; Kee et al., 2007). Mice were trained in the presence (conditioned group) or absence (unconditioned control group) of a single footshock and 24 h later were placed back in the training context for 3 or 30 min. Ninety minutes after the reexposure, mice were assessed for Arc expression using immunohistochemistry. After the 3 min reexposure, conditioned groups showed a significant upregulation of Arc expression in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus and the LA, BLA, and Ce regions of the amygdala (Fig. 6\n) (CA1: \n(1,17) = 13.80,  < 0.05; CA3: \n(1,17) = 10.40,  < 0.05; LA: \n(1,17) = 12.16,  < 0.05; BLA: \n(1,17) = 14.95,  < 0.05; Ce: \n(1,17) = 5.24,  < 0.05). No changes were observed in the DG region of the hippocampus, nor in the PL and IL regions of the mPFC when compared with the unconditioned control groups (Fig. 6\n) (DG: \n(1,17) = 0.46,  > 0.05; PL: \n(1,17) = 0.07,  > 0.05; IL: \n(1,17) = 0.01,  > 0.05).Effects of the duration of reexposure on Arc expression in the mPFC, amygdala, and hippocampus. \n\n, \n\n, Experimental design used with data presented below. \n\n, Effects of the 3 min reexposure duration on Arc expression in the mPFC, amygdala, and hippocampus (reconsolidation,  = 10; control,  = 9). * < 0.05, compared with the control group. \n\n, Effects of the 30 min reexposure duration on Arc expression in mPFC, amygdala, and hippocampus (extinction,  = 11; control,  = 11). * < 0.05, compared with the control group. Error bars are SEM. Data of Arc expression for each group were expressed as the percentage of the averaged values in the control group. Scale bar, 100 \u03bcm.In contrast, after the 30 min reexposure, conditioned groups showed a significant upregulation of Arc expression in the two mPFC regions and the three amygdaloid regions, but not the three hippocampal regions, compared with the unconditioned control groups (Fig. 6\n) (PL: \n(1,20) = 16.56,  < 0.05; IL: \n(1,20) = 12.68,  < 0.05; LA: \n(1,20) = 25.41,  < 0.05; BLA: \n(1,20) = 12.81,  < 0.05; Ce: \n(1,20) = 4.43,  < 0.05; CA1: \n(1,20) = 0.01,  > 0.05; CA3: \n(1,20) = 0.03,  > 0.05; DG: \n(1,20) = 0.01,  > 0.05). These results are consistent with the observations in Figures 3\n\u21d1\u20135 and indicate that the short reexposure that triggered reconsolidation induced CREB-mediated gene expression in the amygdala/hippocampus, whereas the long reexposure that triggered extinction induced expression in the amygdala/mPFC. Furthermore, similar to the results of the CREB activation (Fig. 4), we found that hippocampal Arc is upregulated in the reconsolidation but not extinction phases, suggesting that these two processes may interact at the molecular level in the hippocampus.The above analyses suggest that short context reexposure that triggers reconsolidation induces activation of CREB-mediated gene expression in the amygdala and hippocampus. In contrast, long context reexposure that triggers extinction induces CREB activation in the amygdala and mPFC (Figs. 3\n\u21d1\u20135). These results raise the possibility that new gene expression in distinct brain regions is required for reconsolidation and extinction of contextual fear memory, respectively. To further test this possibility, we examined the effects of protein synthesis inhibition in the mPFC, amygdala, or hippocampus on reconsolidation and extinction of contextual fear memory. We performed a similar experiment as in Figure 1, except that WT mice received an infusion of the protein synthesis inhibitor ANI or VEH immediately after the 3 or 30 min reexposure to the context (Fig. 7\n). Cannula tip placements are shown in the supplementary data, and only mice with cannula tips within the boundaries of the mPFC, hippocampus or amygdala were included in the data analysis (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). During the 3 min reexposure, the VEH and ANI groups showed comparable levels of freezing ( > 0.05). Infusion of ANI into the mPFC immediately after the 3 min reexposure did not alter the level of freezing tested 24 h later (\n(1,19) = 0.17;  > 0.05); ANI-treated mice exhibited comparable freezing levels compared with VEH-treated mice (Fig. 7\n). In contrast, an infusion of ANI into the hippocampus or amygdala immediately after the 3 min reexposure impaired the expression of the contextual fear memory tested 24 h later (hippocampus: \n(1,23) = 13.84,  < 0.05; amygdala: \n(1,16) = 5.32,  < 0.05); ANI-treated mice exhibited significantly lower freezing levels compared with VEH-treated mice (Fig. 7\n) ( < 0.05). These results are consistent with previous findings and confirmed that hippocampal protein synthesis is required for reconsolidation of the contextual fear memory (Debiec et al., 2002; Frankland et al., 2006; Suzuki et al., 2008). The novel result is that we found that reconsolidation of contextual fear memory requires new protein synthesis in the amygdala. Together with our anatomical analyses (Figs. 3\n\u21d1\n\u21d1\u20136), our results indicate that reconsolidation of contextual fear memory requires new gene expression in the hippocampus and amygdala but not in the mPFC.Effects of protein synthesis inhibition in the mPFC, hippocampus, or amygdala on reconsolidation and extinction. \n\n, Experimental design used with data.

During reexposure, freezing scores in 5 min blocks are presented. Error bars are SEM. * < 0.05 versus VEH-treated groups.During the 30 min reexposure, comparable within-session extinction was observed between the VEH and ANI groups (mPFC: overall freezing, \n(1.80) = 3.56,  > 0.05; decrease over time, \n(5,80) = 26.07,  < 0.05; hippocampus: overall freezing, \n(1.90) = 0.08,  > 0.05; decrease over time, \n(5,90) = 26.61,  < 0.05; amygdala: overall freezing, \n(1.75) = 0.43,  > 0.05; decrease over time, \n(5,75) = 30.92,  < 0.05). Measurements 24 h after this 30 min reexposure indicated that long-term extinction occurred in the VEH-treated mice (first 5 min in reexposure session vs test; mPFC: \n(16) = 5.03,  < 0.05; hippocampus: \n(18) = 3.75,  < 0.05; amygdala: \n(13) = 4.27,  < 0.05). Infusion of ANI into the mPFC or amygdala immediately after the 30 min reexposure impaired the long-term extinction of the contextual fear memory tested 24 h later (mPFC: \n(1,16) = 9.24,  < 0.05; amygdala: \n(1,15) = 9.25,  < 0.05); ANI-treated mice exhibited significantly higher freezing levels compared with VEH-treated mice (Fig. 7\n) ( < 0.05). In contrast, infusion of ANI into the hippocampus did not alter the level of freezing tested 24 h later (\n(1,18) = 0.08;  > 0.05) (Fig. 7\n). These results indicated that protein synthesis in the mPFC and amygdala but not the hippocampus is required for long-term extinction of contextual fear memory.Together, these observations support our results from the biochemical experiments that CREB-mediated gene expression is induced in distinct regions in the reconsolidation and extinction phases and suggest that the hippocampus, amygdala, and mPFC play distinct roles in the reconsolidation and extinction of the contextual fear memory through region-specific regulation of gene expression.Our previous behavioral studies demonstrated that memory reactivation triggers two processes: reconsolidation and extinction (Suzuki et al., 2004). These two processes have opposing actions on the fate of the retrieved memory: reconsolidation serves to stabilize or strengthen the memory, whereas extinction involves the formation of an inhibitory CS\u2013no US association that competes with the original memory. Using a contextual fear-conditioning paradigm, in the present study we first established that both these processes depend on CREB-mediated transcription (Fig. 1). Using immunohistochemical and targeted pharmacological approaches, our studies next indicated that these competing processes are supported by partially dissociable brain regions. After brief reactivation, new proteins are required in the hippocampus/amygdala for reconsolidation of contextual fear memories (Fig. 7\n). In contrast, after prolonged reactivation, new proteins are required in the amygdala/mPFC for long-term extinction (Fig. 7\n).A critical biochemical feature of reconsolidation and long-term extinction of contextual fear memory is a requirement for gene expression (Suzuki et al., 2004). We previously demonstrated that CREB-mediated transcription is required for the reconsolidation of the contextual fear memory (Kida et al., 2002). In this study, genetic suppression of CREB function also blocked long-term extinction, indicating that long-term extinction undergoes a transcription-dependent process (Fig. 1\n,). To investigate the brain regions activated in the reconsolidation and extinction phases, we analyzed the brain regions where CREB is activated by measuring levels of pCREB after either brief (3 min) or prolonged (30 min) reexposure to the conditioning context. Furthermore, to determine whether our observations of CREB activation are reflected by the expression of CREB-dependent, neuronal activity-dependent genes, we measured the expression levels of Arc.When a shorter context reexposure was used, we found that CREB-mediated gene expression (CREB phosphorylation and Arc induction) was induced in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus and the LA, BLA, and Ce regions of the amygdala (Figs. 3\n\u21d1\n\u21d1\u20136). These data suggest that reconsolidation engages CREB-dependent processes in the hippocampus and amygdala (but not the mPFC). These observations are consistent with previous findings showing that retrieval of contextual fear memory induces c- and Zif268 expression in the CA1 of hippocampus but not the PL and IL of the mPFC (Frankland et al., 2004). Similarly, another study showed that this retrieval induces Zif268 expression in the LA, BLA, and Ce regions of the amygdala and the CA1 but not the DG of the hippocampus (Lee et al., 2001). Consistent with previous observations (Debiec et al., 2002; Suzuki et al., 2008), we showed that hippocampal inhibition of protein synthesis disrupts subsequent expression of the contextual fear memory (Fig. 7\n). More importantly, we finally demonstrated that protein synthesis inhibition in the amygdala also disrupted the reactivated contextual fear memory (Fig. 7\n). These observations indicate that reconsolidation of the contextual fear memory depends on new gene expression in the hippocampus and amygdala.After prolonged reexposure to the context, we found that CREB-mediated gene expression was induced in the amygdala and the mPFC (Figs. 3, 5, 6). Consistent with these changes in CREB phosphorylation and Arc expression, we found that long-term extinction was blocked by protein synthesis inhibition in the mPFC and amygdala but not in the hippocampus (Fig. 7\n). These observations suggested that long-term extinction of contextual fear memory depends on new gene expression in the mPFC and amygdala. Recent studies have shown that the amygdala plays a significant role in the acquisition of tone fear extinction, whereas the mPFC is implicated in its consolidation (Quirk et al., 2000; Santini et al., 2004). Indeed, consolidation of tone fear extinction requires protein synthesis and NMDA receptor-dependent bursting in the mPFC (Santini et al., 2004; Burgos-Robles et al., 2007). Together with our findings, these data suggest that the amygdala and mPFC might play critical roles in the extinction of both contextual and tone fear memories.Our observations that CREB activation and Arc expression are induced in the hippocampus/amygdala and amygdala/mPFC in the reconsolidation and extinction phases, respectively, indicates that gene expression is regulated in distinct ways after brief versus prolonged context reexposure (Figs. 3\n\u21d1\n\u21d1\u20136). In particular, these observations extend our previous behavioral observations that reexposure to the CS triggers two distinct time-dependent processes, reconsolidation and extinction, and indicate that reconsolidation and extinction are dissociable at the anatomical level.Previous studies have established that protein synthesis inhibition after a brief reexposure to the CS disrupts the subsequent expression of the reactivated fear memory (Nader et al., 2000; Debiec et al., 2002; Kida et al., 2002). In contrast, blocking protein synthesis after prolonged reexposure blocks long-term extinction but does not disrupt the original fear memory (Eisenberg et al., 2003; Pedreira and Maldonado, 2003; Suzuki et al., 2004). Whereas it is not unexpected that new proteins are necessary for the formation of a long-term extinction memory (Santini et al., 2004), it is surprising that the original fear memory is left intact, although it has been reactivated under the condition in which protein synthesis was inhibited (Suzuki et al., 2004). This observation indicates that reconsolidation and extinction do not proceed independently (but see Duvarci et al., 2006). That is, these two processes must interact in some way.Importantly, the present series of experiments identify the hippocampus and the amygdala as candidate anatomical loci for this interaction between the reconsolidation and extinction phases. First, we observed that CREB-mediated gene expression is induced in the hippocampus after short, but not longer, reexposure to the CS (Fig. 4). This suggests that gene expression in the hippocampus undergoes distinct regulation in the reconsolidation and extinction phases. Our observation that CREB-mediated gene expression was not induced in the extinction phase even though contextual fear was reactivated indicates that such induction must be suppressed when within-session extinction occurs. Second, we observed differences in the time course of amygdaloid CREB activation in the reconsolidation and extinction phases (Fig. 5), indicating that amygdaloid CREB activation is differentially regulated in these two phases and, furthermore, that amygdaloid CREB activation observed in the extinction phase is not simply caused by fear memory reactivation. Furthermore, amygdaloid inhibition of protein synthesis after prolonged reexposure blocked long-term extinction without affecting the subsequent expression of the original fear memory, whereas this inhibition after brief reexposure disrupted the fear memory (Fig. 7). Therefore, we conclude that the interaction between the reconsolidation and extinction phases occurs in both the hippocampus and the amygdala at the molecular level. However, we cannot exclude another possibility: the CS onset initiates memory reactivation, but CS offset is the critical signal that determines the fate of memory by engaging reconsolidation or extinction processes (Pedreira et al., 2004, P\u00e9rez-Cuesta et al. 2007).Our anatomical observations that acquisition of within-session extinction of the contextual fear inhibited CREB-mediated gene expression in the hippocampus corresponds with our behavioral observations that the acquisition of extinction prevents the disruption of the contextual fear memory by the inhibition of protein synthesis or CREB activity (Figs. 1, 7). Because previous studies demonstrated that destabilization and restabilization of reactivated contextual fear memories are hippocampus dependent (Debiec et al., 2002; Suzuki et al., 2008), it is possible that contextual fear extinction modulates the stability of the reactivated contextual fear memory by regulating hippocampal function. Therefore, it will be important to evaluate whether acquisition of contextual fear extinction prevents the destabilization of reactivated memory. A second possibility is that the originally contextual fear memory is destabilized and then restabilized (inactivated) in the extinction phase in a gene expression-independent manner (such as redistribution of preexisting proteins).Restabilization of the reactivated contextual fear memory requires new gene expression in the hippocampus (Debiec et al., 2002). In contrast, we observed that inhibition of protein synthesis in the hippocampus did not affect long-term extinction (Fig. 7\n), suggesting that the new protein synthesis in the hippocampus does not contribute to the consolidation of extinction memory. These contrasting observations indicate that the hippocampus plays distinct roles in reconsolidation and extinction of contextual fear memory. However, recent studies indicated critical roles of the hippocampus in the extinction of contextual fear. Indeed, cdk5 signaling, activation of the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway, activation of CB1, and actin rearrangement in the hippocampus have been shown to be required for extinction of contextual fear memory (Fischer et al., 2004; Sananbenesi et al., 2007; de Oliveira Alvares et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2008). Therefore, it is possible that the hippocampus regulates contextual fear extinction through activation of these pathways without activating gene expression. Suppression of gene expression in the hippocampus might be a critical step that leads to long-term extinction. Additional studies are required to investigate the regulatory roles of the hippocampus in memory extinction.We observed that CREB activation and Arc expression were induced in the amygdala in both the reconsolidation and extinction phases (Figs. 5, 6). In agreement with this, previous studies demonstrated that extinction learning of tone fear induces expression of c- in the amygdala (Herry and Mons, 2004; Herry et al., 2008). However, a recent study demonstrated that retrieval of the contextual fear memory reactivates BLA neurons that are activated during contextual fear conditioning, whereas extinction learning prevents their activation (Reijmers et al., 2007). Together with these findings, our observation that the time course of amygdaloid CREB activation differs in the reconsolidation and extinction phases raises the possibility that distinct populations of amygdaloid neurons are activated in these phases. A recent study identified two distinct populations of BLA neurons (fear and extinction neurons), the activity of which is reversely correlated with low and high fear behavior (Herry et al., 2008). Therefore, it will be important to examine whether identical or different population of neurons are activated in the reconsolidation and extinction phases of contextual fear memory.S.K. was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research, High Technology Research and Priority Areas\u2013Molecular Brain Science (18022038 and 22022039) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, Japan; by Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology, Japan; and by the Research Grant for Nervous and Mental Disorders from the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare, Japan.Thank you for sharing this Journal of Neuroscience article.NOTE: We request your email address only to inform the recipient that it was you who recommended this article, and that it is not junk mail.

Synchronization between different cortical areas has been suggested as one possible mechanism for corticocortical interaction. Here, we report robust, directional cross-frequency synchronization between distant sensorimotor sites in human neocortex during a movement task. In four subjects, electrocorticographic recordings from the cortical surface revealed a low-frequency rhythm (10\u201313 Hz) that combined with a higher frequency (77\u201382 Hz) in a ventral region of the premotor cortex to produce a third rhythm at the sum of these two frequencies in a distant motor site. Such cross-frequency coupling implies a nonlinear interaction between these cortical sites. These findings demonstrate that task-specific, phase\u2013phase coupling can support communication between distant areas of the human neocortex.Synchronization of cortical areas in the human brain plays an important role in the understanding of the computational basis for human cognition (Kahana, 2006). Phase synchronization at single frequencies between distant areas is thought to be relevant to how these regions interact and such synchronization (e.g., in the motor system) has been well studied (Ohara et al., 2001; Gross et al., 2002; Simoes et al., 2003). However, coupling across frequencies would allow for much more complex corticocortical interactions (Buzs\u00e1ki and Draguhn, 2004) and has been examined in brain signals (Shils et al., 1996; Schack et al., 2002; Palva et al., 2005; Canolty et al., 2006). Cross-frequency coupling in the human brain suggests nonlinear interaction, and it is speculated that such interactions play a crucial role in the coordination of complex cortical computation. A possible role for cross-frequency coupling between distant sites could be information exchange as a result of distributed cortical processing of complex behavior. Here, we demonstrate time-dependent cross-frequency phase coupling between distant sites in the motor area during execution of a simple finger movement task, using a biphase-locking synchronization measure. This measure is sensitive to quadratic (i.e., multiplicative) interactions between signals. In contrast to harmonic m:n phase coupling of single frequency bands, which can also be detected by biphase locking, this measure can detect coupling between any two frequencies. Unlike bicoherence, which has been previously used in cross-frequency analysis (Schack et al., 2002), the biphase-locking measure is a pure phase synchronization measure (i.e., it is not affected by amplitude covariation). Multiplication of neural signals, as measured by biphase locking, can be seen as a fundamental aspect of higher cortical function and has been shown to exist on a single-neuron level (Gabbiani et al., 2002). Other roles for multiplicative interaction can be found in neuronal control circuits, such as phase-locked loops (Ahissar and Kleinfeld, 2003; Zacksenhouse and Ahissar, 2006) for sensorimotor control, but it could also serve as a natural mechanism for large-scale phase modulation of neuronal ensembles. These modulations exist in ongoing cortical activity and increase specifically during cognitive tasks.Previous studies have analyzed phase\u2013amplitude relationships or amplitude\u2013amplitude relationships, but recent studies have shown that phase\u2013phase relationships across cortical regions are of equal importance (Rudrauf et al., 2006). Although amplitude changes can take place because of an increase in local synchrony, they can also change with increased overall neuronal activity and thus do not, by necessity, reflect synchronization. By the same token, phase synchronization between distant neuronal populations can take place without local amplitude changes (Palva and Palva, 2007). Moreover, phase\u2013phase relationships can be seen as correlates of spike timing, in which synchronization of the phases directly reflects neuronal communication (Fries, 2005).Previous human electrocorticographic (ECoG) studies (Mormann et al., 2005; Canolty et al., 2006) have shown that there exists modulation of high frequencies in the gamma band (>40 Hz) by lower frequencies during behavioral tasks. Specifically, it has been shown that low (8\u201332 Hz) and high (76\u2013100 Hz) frequencies play complementary roles during finger movement (Miller et al., 2007a). The high-frequency increases appear to reflect more local behavior and are distinct from the low-frequency decreases in power that occur with movement (Miller et al., 2007b). Therefore, we focused our analysis on interactions between frequencies ranging from 6 to 24 Hz, covering the alpha and beta bands, with frequencies from 48 to 96 Hz band (gamma to high gamma).Data were recorded from four epileptic patients who had 8 \u00d7 8 electrode grid arrays (1 cm interelectrode distance), implanted with sensorimotor coverage, for electrocorticographic localization of seizures. Subjects gave their informed consent according to the protocol approved by the internal review board of the University of Washington. The subject demographics are shown in Table 1.Subject demographicsA visual cue was displayed on a liquid crystal display screen at random intervals. Subjects were instructed to move their thumb as soon as possible after the appearance of the visual cue. A total of 30 cues were presented per subject.The ECoG data were sampled continuously over the course of the experiment at 1 kHz with an analog low-pass filter of 250 Hz. The exact onset of the movement was recorded by a data glove (5DT Virtual Realities). The data glove output for each finger was also continuously recorded at the same sampling rate.All data were downsampled off-line to 250 Hz and re-referenced to a common average reference (CAR). A CAR was used because the original references were either scalp or neck references, which were susceptible to line noise and EMG artifacts. We used the increase of the slope of the dataglove output for the thumb to identify the exact movement onset and to segment the ECoG data into trials starting \u22122.5 s before movement onset and ending at 2.5 s after movement onset. Only movements after the visual cue were used for segmentation. Visual inspection for artifacts led to the removal of three trials for subject 2; all other subjects were found to be free of artifacts.To test for event-related nonlinear relationships between electrode pairs, we used an extension of the standard phase-locking value (PLV) (Tass et al., 1998; Lachaux et al., 1999), the biphase-locking value (bPLV), to analyze the time-resolved phase relationship between two frequency components (, 1) and (, 2) in signal () and the resulting multiplicative component 3 = 1 + 2 in signal (), (, 3). Like the frequencies, the phases of the signals add as well, such that \u03c63() = \u03c61() + \u03c62(). The bPLV is related to the bicoherence (Nikias and Mendel, 1993) in the same way as PLV is to coherence. Unlike phase locking, which detects only synchronization of signals in a given band, bPLV can detect modulation of the phase of signal (, 3) at one \u201ctarget\u201d site by the independent phases of the frequency components (, 1) and (, 2) at a separate \u201csource\u201d site. This can be used as a measure of causality because the uniqueness of the nonlinear relationship between the source site and the target site has definite directionality; the areas are not merely associated, but independent processes in the source area are unambiguously coupled in the target area.For a number of frequency bins centered at (6\u201324 Hz) and (48\u201396 Hz), with a width of 6 Hz, we computed the pairwise biphase coupling for each subject. The time-dependent bPLV between three signals , , and  is defined as\n\n where \u03c6() is the instantaneous phase of the signal () at frequency  in the th trial and  is the total number of trials (here, repetitions of the thumb movement). In this study, the instantaneous phases of the signals were computed from the Hilbert transform of the narrow band filtered signals (with the filter centered at ). We defined the bPLV in the equation above as an interaction between three signals [(), (), and ()]; however, it can be rewritten as a two-way interaction if we assume that signal () carries independent information in the two frequency bands centered at 1 and 2. In this case,  becomes , and, because  \u2260 , this measure of interaction between the two signals is a directional measure. Analogous to the conventional PLV, the bPLV takes on values between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating no phase coupling and 1 indicating perfect phase coupling at these frequencies. In the case of the bPLV, a nonlinearity that produces perfectly biphase locking for a pair of frequencies (1, 2) is a multiplication of the respective frequency components [i.e., (, 1 + 2) = (, 1)(, 2)]. The addition of phases and frequencies through multiplication can be easily illustrated by the complex representation of two oscillatory signals at frequencies 1 and 2 with phases \u03c61 and \u03c62: exp((2\u03c01 + \u03c61))exp((2\u03c02 + \u03c62)) = exp((2\u03c0(1 + 2) + \u03c61 + \u03c62)). This relationship is illustrated in Figure 1. The directionality of the bPLV can also be seen directly from the algebraic relationship between the components in () and () [i.e., (, 1 + 2) = (, 1)(, 2) is not necessarily equal to (, 1 + 2) = (, 1)(, 2) unlike in classical coherence, where for two perfectly coherent components (, 1) = (, 1) holds and the order of () and () is of no relevance]. It should also be noted, that although this measure is directional, it is not necessarily a measure of causality, unless the components (, 1) and (, 2) in signal () are independent. If in signal () the phases \u03c61 and \u03c62 are independent, then we have causality from () to (), because both phases \u03c61 and \u03c62 have to be known to predict \u03c63 = (\u03c61,\u03c62) = \u03c61 + \u03c62 in (). Conversely, knowledge of just \u03c63 cannot be used to predict \u03c61 and \u03c62.Example of multiplicative frequency coupling. , A \u201ccarrier\u201d signal (, 1) = exp((2\u03c01 + \u03c61(, 1))) at 80 Hz. The right side shows the time series of the real part of the carrier (thick line) and the instantaneous phase \u03c61(, 1). The left side shows the associated power spectrum of the real part of the carrier signal. , The 10 Hz real part of the signal component (, 2) = exp((2\u03c02 + \u03c62(, 2))) with instantaneous phase \u03c62(, 2) (right) and associated power spectrum (left). , Real component of exp((2\u03c01 + \u03c61(, 1)))exp((2\u03c02 + \u03c62(, 2))), with a phase modulated by the components (, 1) and (, 2) [i.e., \u03c6(, 1 + 2) = \u03c61(, 1) + \u03c62(, 2) (left) and power spectrum (right), which peaks at 90 Hz]. , Trial-wise computation of the bPLV. Left, The green arrows show the phases \u03c61(, 1) and \u03c62(, 2) in signal 1; the red arrows show the compound phase, \u03c61(, 1) + \u03c62(, 2), in signal 1; and the blue arrows show the phase at frequency 1 + 2 in signal 2. Right, The gray arrows show the trial-wise phase difference between the compound phase in signal 1 and the phase in signal two. The black arrow shows the mean phase difference across trials. The length of the black arrow is the bPLV.If \u03c62 = \u03c62(\u03c61) (i.e., if there is dependence of \u03c62 on \u03c61), then it follows that \u03c63 = (\u03c61) [i.e., \u03c63 is only dependent on \u03c61, and consequently \u03c61 = \u22121(\u03c63)] (i.e., \u03c61 could be predicted equally well from \u03c63 as \u03c63 from \u03c61). In this case, the bPLV would not be a directional measure.Because a CAR was subtracted from the data before additional processing, the bPLV was computed between signals (, 1 + 2) = *(, 1 + 2) \u2212 (, 1 + 2), (, 1) = *(, 1) \u2212 (, 1), and (, 2) = *(, 2) \u2212 (, 2), where * indicates the \u201ctrue\u201d signals and (, ) are the frequency components of the CAR. An observation of a high bPLV between signals () and () thus could be attributable to biphase coupling in the CAR instead of being a genuine effect between the true signals, similar to apparent increases in coherence between channels because of power changes in the CAR. However, because the CAR component is the same in each channel, a purely CAR-induced bPLV would manifest itself as a symmetric interaction across channels (i.e., we would expect  = ). Conversely, nonsymmetric interactions can only arise from interactions between parts of the signal that are not common across channels.Because we had no a priori knowledge about specific frequency pairs and interaction sites, we tested all electrode pairs and a range of low-to-high frequency pairs for movement-specific increase of bPLV. To separate increases in bPLV caused by genuine cortical interactions from spurious changes of the bPLV, we computed the significance of the movement-related bPLV increase with respect to the baseline distribution of bPLV values during a rest period before movement. The baseline distribution, which was used as null hypothesis, was estimated by a permutation of signal segments in the baseline. Values of  for the increase of the bPLV above the baseline were Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons across channel pairs and frequencies.For each channel pair (, ) of the 4096 (S1 and S3, for which 64 channels from the grid were recorded) or 2304 (S2 and S4, for which 48 channels were recorded) possible pairs,  was bandpass filtered with the band center at 1 and 2 and a bandwidth of 6 Hz, and  was filtered at a band center 1 + 2. Unlike for symmetric measures like coherence or PLV, we have to consider all 2 pair combinations for  channels, because of the directionality of the measure. The bPLV from channel 1 to channel 2 is not equal to bPLV from channel 2 to channel 1. It should also be noted that this measure allows for interaction of a channel with itself because independent information can be contained in the two frequency bands at 1 and 2 in a single channel. We stepped through the bands in 6 Hz steps from 6 to 24 Hz for the low-frequency bands and from 48 to 96 Hz for the high-frequency bands, resulting in a total of 36 frequency bins, and computed the time-resolved bPLV for each channel and frequency pair. The result of this analysis for each channel and frequency pair is a set of 2 number of frequency bins time series, each representing the temporal evolution of the bPLV from \u22122.5 s before movement onset to 2.5 s after movement onset (147,456 time series for S1 and S3, 82,944 time series for S2 and S4) and each time series consisting of 1249 samples. Because we have no a priori knowledge about the specific temporal evolution of the bPLV for the given paradigm and to reduce the amount of data to be tested, we integrated the time series for each pair and frequency bin over time. To test the hypothesis, whether there is a movement-related increase in bPLV, we computed the temporal mean of the bPLV over the movement interval from 0 to 1 s, with 0 s at the beginning of the movement, and compared it with the temporal mean bPLV over the premovement interval from \u22121.5 to \u22120.5 s.To test our hypothesis, that the mean bPLV in the movement interval is increased compared with the mean bPLV in the premovement or rest interval, we have to learn the null distribution of this statistic under the rest condition. Given this distribution, we can compute  values for the mean bPLV during movement. Because we have only 27\u201330 trials per subject and the bPLV is defined as a mean quantity over these trials (i.e., we just have a single sample of the bPLV per subject for the movement segment) (i.e., [0 s 1 s] and the premovement segment [\u22121.5 s \u22120.5 s]), we have to use resampling techniques to get the null distribution of the mean bPLV under rest condition.We used a permutation test to estimate the distribution of the mean bPLV for the rest period that was free from any finger movement. We randomly exchanged the [\u22121.5 s \u22120.5 s] segment with the [\u22122.5 s \u22121.5 s] segment, which was also movement free, in a subset of the thumb movement trials. Our assumption in this permutation scheme is that the underlying distribution of the mean bPLV is the same for both segments, and thus by permuting segments within the baseline we can get an estimate of that baseline distribution. In traditional permutation tests, the permutation is often performed between baseline and signal to learn the null distribution. Intervals in a permutation test have to be exchangeable under the null hypothesis (Pantazis et al., 2005). However, because we are actually assuming that our null hypothesis does not hold during movement in the actual data, in which we assume that the mean bPLV is higher than during the rest period, permuting signal and baseline segments would bias the resulting null distribution toward higher bPLV values and thus lead to artificially lower  values for the movement mean bPLV. Therefore, permuting segments in the baseline is the better choice to learn the null distribution, because we are not contaminating our permutation samples with segments in which the mean bPLV is high because of movement, and are thus increasing the power of our statistical test (Efron et al., 2001; Chau et al., 2004).We repeated this permutation 1000 times to estimate reliably the distribution of the mean bPLV under rest condition for each channel and frequency pair. The bPLV is bounded between 0 and 1, and we can approximate its probability density function by a bounded analytical distribution. We chose the two-parameter \u03b2 distribution, which can approximate the empirical bPLV distribution well, to compute the  values for bPLV during movement. This analytic approximation is useful, because we have to correct the  values for the total number of channel pairs under consideration, and this would normally require a very large number of permutations (\u223c105), which would lead to prohibitively long computation times.To find interactions among the larger number of possible interactions, which are common and significant across all subjects, we apply a number of spatial and statistical filters to our data.Individual channel positions were mapped into a standard Talairach atlas, based on x-ray images. For better comparability, we projected positions for the right hemisphere subject (subject 1) also onto the left hemisphere. The individual montages are shown in Figure 2. Our initial hypothesis is that, during movement, bPLV is increased in specific channel pairs in the sensorimotor system. Therefore restrict our choice of interaction pairs (from a total of 82,944\u2013147,456) to those that originate and end in the sensorimotor areas [i.e., the somatosensory, premotor, and motor areas (Brodmann areas 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6)]. We identified these Brodmann areas in Talairach space, and, because we mapped all our individual electrode positions into that space, we can determine for each electrode and subject in which functional area it lies. This restriction is motivated by the experimental paradigm (i.e., the finger movement task), in which we naively expect a task-related response in these areas. We computed  values for each interaction pair in the sensorimotor area and we corrected them for multiple comparisons across all possible channel pairs in these areas and for the number of frequency bins, using a conservative Bonferroni correction. We found 576 pairs in S1, 484 in S2, 400 in S3, and 484 in S4. With a total of 36 frequency pair bins, this results in a correction for 20,736 tests in S1, 17,424 tests in S2, 14,400 tests in S3, and 17,424 in S4. To select only significant interactions for additional analysis, we chose from all channel pairs those interactions with a corrected value of  < 0.05. From these, a subset of interactions was selected, which exhibited the greatest spatial coherence across all subjects (i.e., interactions in which the corresponding electrode positions for the start and endpoint of interaction were <2.8 cm separated in the common Talairach brain atlas). If interactions were on the same grid, 2.8 cm is the maximum distance between two electrodes that are separated by just one grid position between them. This selection criterion is based on the assumption that functionally similar processes should lie in similar anatomical region across subjects. To select long-range interactions, we further limited the selection to interactions that covered a distance of >2.8 cm. This additional selection ensures also that we select only interactions that can be reliably identified as spatially consistent, given the overall low spatial resolution of the electrode placement. Also, potential volume conduction effects between electrodes, that are further apart, can be expected to be small (Lachaux et al., 1999). A graphical example of the selection process is shown in Figure 3.Common phase modulation in the motor cortex across subjects. , Electrode coverage. Blue, Subject 1; green, subject 2; red, subject 3; yellow, subject 4. Note that the positions for subject 1 have been projected from the right to the left hemisphere. The black markers indicate the seizure onset zone as identified by the clinician. , Significant phase\u2013phase interactions were found in all subjects (S1, light blue; S2, green; S3, red; S4, yellow) after clustering by spatial proximity. Brodmann areas are color coded as follows: BA1, brown; BA2, green; BA3, blue; BA4, pink; BA6, purple. Spatially consistent interactions across subjects form a cluster from premotor sources (BA6) to peri-Rolandic primary motor targets (BA4). Interactions are indicated by color-coded arrows, in which the point of the arrow indicates the direction of interaction.Clustering scheme to find spatially consistent interactions across subjects. , Initially, a large number of interactions between grid electrodes with uncorrected significances ( < 0.05) is found for each subject. , Interactions are restricted to electrodes that lie in Brodmann areas 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 (red circles). , This procedure is applied to each subject. Exemplary, we show interactions from two subjects (black and green) overlaid on the same grid. Note that the individual grids can have different electrode numbering schemes, and thus electrodes with different indices can cover different Brodmann areas in different subjects. , Interactions are grouped into clusters by spatial proximity. Interactions for which the beginning and end points are within a 2.8 cm range (the farthest distance between two electrodes in an 8-electrode neighborhood), indicated by the transparent blue circles, and which cover a distance >2.8 cm are grouped into the same cluster. , The final cluster configuration.Across all four subjects, we found 6 interactions in S1 with a corrected value of  < 0.05 in the sensorimotor region, 3 interactions in S2, 10 interactions in S3, and 5 interactions in S4. Spatial clustering of these results, as described in the previous section, results in a single, spatial consistent cluster of interactions across all subjects between premotor \u201csources\u201d (BA6) to peri-Rolandic primary motor \u201ctargets\u201d (BA4). This cluster of interactions contains a single interaction per subject, which we label by the anatomical direction of interaction (i.e., premotor \u2192 motor) and the frequencies across which these electrodes couple [e.g., (12, 60) Hz premotor \u2192 motor in S1]. A mapping of these interactions onto the generic cortical surface is shown in Figure 2. At a ventral premotor source site, we find low frequencies of 6, 12, and 24 Hz interacting with 48, 60, 78, and 54 Hz to produce the coupled frequency in the dorsal target site over motor cortex. In all subjects, seizure foci (Table 1) were well away from the areas of interest we found and all patients were studied during a period of relative epileptic silence. Stimulation mapping for all subjects also confirmed that they had motor evoked responses at expected positions and currents. The bPLV interactions we found were just one grid position posterior to these mappings.In Table 2, we show the mean bPLV during movement for these interactions along with the mean bPLV during rest, along with the corrected  values for these increases. In Figure 4, we show the temporal evolution for the bPLV value from \u22122.5 s before movement onset to 2.5 s past movement onset along with the output of the data glove. In all subjects, there is a significant increase in bPLV for these channel pairs, which coincides with the actual movement onset as recorded by the data glove.Mean increase in bPLV during movement and premovementTemporal evolution of the bPLV. Gray, Time intervals used as baseline for statistical testing. Green, Time interval used to compute the mean bPLV during movement. Blue, Smoothed temporal evolution of the bPLV. Red, Average thumb movement as recorded by the data glove. Black, Mean premovement bPLV. Numbers above the bar graphs indicate Bonferroni-corrected  values for movement-related increase in coupling.To ensure that these increases are not caused by stimulus or motor-locked artifacts, we used an additional permutation scheme, in which we now permute the trial order between interacting pairs of channels, before computing the mean bPLV for the movement and the rest period (Lachaux et al., 1999) (i.e., we test whether channel  in the th trial is biphase locked with channel  in the th trial). The rationale for this test is to reveal whether the observed interaction is attributable to some external fixed stimulus locked event (e.g., the movement of the data glove that would be independent of the trial order) or caused by genuine cortical interactions. Stimulus locked events will be invariant under permutation of the trial order and if the increase in bPLV between two channels is caused by such events, it can be expected to remain high, when we shuffle the trial order for one of the channels. We generated 10,000 permutation samples of the mean bPLV for each subject and determined the  value for our measured values of the mean bPLV as the proportion of resampled values that exceed the original value. We applied this permutation test to the rest and the movement period. The resulting  values for all subjects for this set of interactions are shown in Table 3. For each subject, the bPLV increase during movement is highly sensitive to the specific trial order and as such to the precise timing within each trial. In contrast, we find that the premovement period is not affected by trial shuffling, which confirms that there is no bPLV in the rest period before the finger movement. values for trial-shuffling testHaving demonstrated significant interactions of given frequency bands for specific electrodes, we examined  the interactions between these cortical regions across all low-to-high frequency couplings. This  analysis is motivated by the conservative threshold that we applied in our initial search for bPLV interactions and our initial coarse frequency band spacing, which could have obscured frequency and channel pairs, that could have shown up as significant in a hypothesis-driven approach. We computed the mean bPLV increase during movement over a broader frequency range from 6 to 30 Hz over 31 to 90 Hz in 1 Hz steps for all channel pairs in the sensorimotor region for each subject to identify common channel and frequency pairs across all subjects. We used the initial channel pairs found by our data-driven approach to test for the hypothesis, whether there are interactions between similar anatomical locations involving similar frequencies. Figure 5 shows the frequency maps for the channel pairs that we identified in our previous analysis for subjects S2\u2013S4. These maps show the strongest increase in the mean bPLV during movement near the frequencies that we previously identified. Based on these maps, we find that the strongest interaction for S2 between premotor and motor is not located at (12, 78) Hz but at (13, 77) Hz. However, we also find that, in S3, there is a strong increase in bPLV between premotor and motor at frequencies (13, 81) Hz in addition to the previously found pair at (24, 54) Hz. Likewise, we find for S4 an additional interaction at (10, 80) Hz. Although we did not find a peak near (10, 80) Hz in the map for the initial premotor \u2192 motor channel pair in S1, inspection of the maps for neighboring channel pairs showed that the lower left neighbor of the motor channel in the montage for S1 has increased mean bPLV during movement at frequencies (10, 82) Hz (Fig. 5). The interaction pairs (10, 82) Hz motor \u2192 premotor for S1, (13, 77) Hz for S2, (13, 81) Hz for S3, and (10, 80) Hz for S4 along with the respective Talairach coordinates are shown in Figure 6.Frequency\u2013frequency maps of the mean bPLV over the movement segment [0 s \u22121 s] for channel interactions between premotor-to-motor channel pairs for all subjects. Note that there is a strong similarity for S2 and S3 in these maps. The common interaction frequency located at approximately (10, 80 Hz) is indicated by the white circles. The Bonferroni-corrected significance levels, in which we correct for the number of frequency bins, are indicated by the white ( \u2264 0.2) and black ( \u2264 0.05) contour lines.Interaction cluster with revised position for the interaction in S1. The same color coding as in Figure 2 is used. The mean Talairach coordinates across all subjects were at  = \u221258,  = \u221214,  = 39 (source site), and  = \u221238,  = \u221231,  = 63 (target site).The mean bPLV increase during movement versus the mean bPLV increase during rest as well as the  values for the movement-related increase are shown in Table 4. Note that we show uncorrected  values for these interactions. The time courses of the bPLV for these interactions are shown in Figure 7. If we test for the general hypothesis that any channel pair at any frequency during finger movement shows increased bPLV, these interactions will not be significant because of the multiple comparison correction and our data-driven analysis initially did not reveal those interactions. However, when we test for the specific hypothesis that these channel pairs interact at the given frequencies, we find them to be highly significant ( < 0.01, ) across all four subjects. Furthermore, these interactions are consistent in frequencies and anatomical location. It is also noteworthy that we find for S1, who carried out left-handed thumb movements and where recordings were made from the right hemisphere, the same bPLV increase was observed as for the other three subjects with left hemispheric coverage. This indicates that this effect is not tied to a specific hemisphere. To test for external stimulus locked events, we applied the trial shuffling permutation tests as previously described. The resulting  values are shown in Table 5. Similar to our previous analysis, we find that the bPLV during movement is highly sensitive to the trial order, whereas the rest period bPLV is not, which indicates that the increase in bPLV that is observed during movement for these channel and frequency pairs is not caused by stimulus locked external events.Mean increase in bPLV during movement and premovementTemporal evolution of the bPLV for selected premotor-to-motor channel pairs. values for trial shuffling for  analysisTo test for the directionality of the observed bPLV, we analyze the dependence of the phases \u03c61 and \u03c62 in the premotor region during movement (i.e., in the interval from [0 s 1 s]). We computed the mutual information for each trial and subject between the phases \u03c61 and \u03c62 of the signal in the premotor region during movement and compare this with the mutual information of the sum of these phases [i.e., \u03c61(, 1) + \u03c62(, 2) to the respective phase in the motor region \u03c6(, 1 + 2)]. The results for each subject are shown in Figure 8. In all subjects, the mean mutual information between the phases in the premotor region is considerably lower than the mutual information between the sum of these phases and the respective phase in the motor region. This means that \u03c61 and \u03c62 are less mutually dependent than \u03c61(, 1) + \u03c62(, 2) and \u03c6(, 1 + 2), which shows that the measured bPLV is indeed a directional measure from the premotor region to the motor region.Mean mutual information (over trials) for each subject between the phases \u03c61(, 1) and \u03c62(, 2) (white bars) in the premotor region during movement and mean mutual information between the phase in the motor region, \u03c6(, 1 + 2), and the sum of the phases in the premotor region (gray), \u03c61(, 1) + \u03c62(, 2), during movement. The error bars indicate the SEM.  shows the mutual information for the results from the initial analysis, and , for the  results.To get a better understanding of the processes that lead to increase in bPLV during movement, we analyze the power, coherence, and PLV changes between movement and premovement period for all subjects. We focus on the common frequency pair interactions [i.e., the (10\u201313, 77\u201382) Hz \u2192 (90\u201394) Hz interactions], because these are the more interesting candidates for a common interaction mechanism. The power changes for these bands (i.e., 10\u201313, 77\u201382, and 90\u201394 Hz) are shown in Figure 9, in which the average integrated band power increase during movement [0 s 1 s] over the baseline [\u22121.5 s \u22120.5 s] in the respective band is shown for each subject for all electrodes. We used the mean and SD of the respective band power over trials for the baseline to convert the band power during movement into normalized  scores (i.e., the scale on the maps is given in SDs of the baseline band power). A detailed analysis of the power changes for these subjects during hand and finger movement can also be found in the studies by Miller et al. (2007a,b). What is noteworthy here is the fact that the channels involved in the bPLV interaction (indicated by the green arrows) do not coincide with the channels that show the most relevant power increases/decreases in the involved bands. This indicates that the observed bPLV coupling is not correlated with movement-specific power changes, but is indeed a truly phase-related phenomenon. Also, we did not find any significant increases in bPLV over the baseline at the sites of the strongest power increases/decreases. The results of the premovement/movement coherence and phase-locking analysis are shown in Tables 6 and 7.Average integrated band power maps for S1\u2013S4 for the interaction frequencies (10, 80) to 90 Hz. Values for each electrode have been smoothed by a Gaussian kernel to produce spatially smooth maps (Miller et al., 2007a). The band power for each band has been integrated over the movement time period [0 s \u22121 s] and normalized with respect to the baseline period [\u22121.5 s to \u22120.5 s]. The green arrows indicate the nonlinear interaction for premotor-to-motor electrode pairs in S1, S2, S3, and S4. The frequency bands were selected based on the interacting cross-frequencies as identified by the pBLV increase during movement.Coherence for selected channel pairsPhase-locking increase for selected channel pairsWe applied the same baseline-based permutation test for both measures, coherence and phase locking, to determine the significance of the movement-related increases/decreases. Because the selection of interacting channels and frequencies is hypothesis driven, we have only a single comparison per subject and thus do not correct our  values. For individual subjects, we find significant changes in the coherence/phase-locking value during movement; however, these are not consistent across subjects, unlike what we find for the bPLV increase. For S1, we find significant decreases of the coherence for the low-frequency band (with center at 10 Hz) and the high-frequency band at the coupled frequency (with center at 92 Hz), whereas this high-frequency decrease for the PLV is not significant, which indicates that the interactions for these bands for this subject are mostly amplitude driven. Overall, we do not find consistent changes in the coherence and PLV for all subjects (i.e., no consistent synchronization or desynchronization in the bands involved in the consistent bPLV changes).We have shown consistent thumb movement-related increase in bPLV between the premotor and primary motor area in four subjects. The interaction is temporally locked to the onset of thumb movement and is unidirectional, from premotor to primary motor cortex. This demonstrates the existence of task-specific, distributed, and nonlinear networks in the human motor system, activated during movement. These motor networks involve phase\u2013phase coupling across frequencies, which results from a multiplicative interaction. These interactions occur at specific frequencies (10\u201313, 77\u201382) Hz across all subjects. This suggests that there are common specific frequencies that play a role during movement, similarly to the alpha\u2013beta suppression during movement (Crone et al., 1998) but may manifest as subject-specific frequencies, perhaps depending on specific aspects of the individual movement execution. The individually most significant frequencies cover a wide range across the alpha\u2013beta spectrum, as do the frequencies with which they interact. The low components of the common frequencies that interact fall all within the alpha band (10\u201313 Hz) and likewise the high frequencies range only from 77 to 82 Hz, as well the resulting frequencies (90\u201394 Hz). Furthermore, for the (10\u201313, 77\u201382) Hz interaction, we do not find consistent phase synchronization, coherence, or amplitude changes across all subjects between the involved anatomical regions. This shows, on one hand, that the observed task-related bPLV increase during movement is not an epiphenomenon of an underlying single band synchronization or amplitude effect, and, on the other hand, because theoretically single-band synchronization and across-band synchronization can coexist, that the cross-frequency coupling demonstrated here is an exclusively nonlinear effect. Furthermore, the dissociation between areas involved in this nonlinear coupling and areas of single band changes allow speculation that this coupling provides information transfer between brain regions not obtainable from simple synchronization and/or power amplitude changes.A possible role of these (alpha, gamma) to higher gamma interactions could be a phase modulation of the motor region by the premotor region, in which the alpha phase in both regions is regulated by a corticothalamic loop and movement-specific information is passed from the inferior (the modulating) site to the superior (the modulated) site through the 80 Hz gamma phase, resulting in the 90 Hz phase in the modulated site. Given that we do not observe consistent single-band synchronization for the alpha rhythm, this seems unlikely. Alternatively, however, the frequencies in the modulating region could also originate from that region alone, and could simply be used to transmit task-related information in two independent \u201cchannels\u201d to the modulated region. The interaction between the source and target site implies functional coupling between ventral premotor sources and primary sensorimotor target sites, which is well described in nonhuman primates (Geyer et al., 2000) and has been shown to play a role in human motor activity as well (de Graaf et al., 2008). The timing of this interaction just after movement onset leads us to speculate a role of these areas in monitoring movement, perhaps providing planning and feedback instructions with respect to an ongoing movement. The premotor site may correspond to the site of \u201cmirror neurons\u201d (Iacoboni and Dapretto, 2006) tuned to the observation of movement; thus, this observed interaction could represent the transfer of subject's interpretation of the visual observation of their own movement to sensorimotor regions. This would be particularly relevant to the planning of the end of the thumb movement or planning the subsequent repetition. The need for on-line updating to the continuation or end of the visual cue to move the thumb also could be subserved by this mechanism. Future descriptions of phase modulation across other parts of the brain will help refine interpretation of this novel observation.Given the vast space of possible channel and frequency combinations, our results, focusing only on the most significant interactions, should be seen and interpreted as an example of the complex interactions in the human sensorimotor system during voluntary finger movement. The existence of such interactions demonstrates that the human cortex is using a much wider range of communication between distant neuronal populations than can be revealed by single-band interactions. Consequently, multiplicative interaction and, more generally, phase\u2013phase interactions may be a fundamental mode of communication between distant cortical areas.This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants EB007362 and T32-NS07144 and National Science Foundation Grants 0642848 and 0622252.Thank you for sharing this Journal of Neuroscience article.NOTE: We request your email address only to inform the recipient that it was you who recommended this article, and that it is not junk mail.

In most mammals, social chemosignals are predominantly detected by sensory neurons of a specialized olfactory subsystem, the vomeronasal organ (VNO). The behavioral relevance of social chemosignaling puts high demands on the accuracy and dynamic range of the underlying transduction mechanisms. However, the physiological concepts implemented to ensure faithful transmission of social information remain widely unknown. Here, we show that sensory neurons in the basal layer of the mouse VNO dynamically control their input\u2013output relationship by activity-dependent regulation of K+ channel gene expression. Using large-scale expression profiling, immunochemistry, and electrophysiology, we provide molecular and functional evidence for a role of -related gene (ERG) K+ channels as key determinants of cellular excitability. Our findings indicate that an increase in ERG channel expression extends the dynamic range of the stimulus\u2013response function in basal vomeronasal sensory neurons. This novel mechanism of homeostatic plasticity in the periphery of the accessory olfactory system is ideally suited to adjust VNO neurons to a target output range in a layer-specific and use-dependent manner.Mammals have evolved a number of distinct olfactory subsystems (Firestein, 2001; Zufall and Munger, 2001; Ache and Young, 2005; Breer et al., 2006). Among those, the accessory olfactory system and its peripheral sensory structure, the vomeronasal organ (VNO), play a critical role in detecting semiochemicals that control conspecific social behavior (Halpern and Martinez-Marcos, 2003). In rodents, apical vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) express members of the V1R receptor family, whereas VSNs of the basal layer express V2R receptors (Mombaerts, 2004; Rodriguez, 2004). These receptors are thought to detect pheromonal cues that show immense structural diversity ranging from small volatile molecules (Restrepo et al., 2006) and sulfated steroids (Nodari et al., 2008) to complex peptides (Leinders-Zufall et al., 2004; Kimoto et al., 2005) and proteins (Chamero et al., 2007).Semiochemicals trigger profound changes in endocrine status and initiate genetically preprogrammed behaviors (Brennan and Zufall, 2006). To ensure faithful transduction of such biologically relevant information, the dynamic range of VSN input\u2013output relationships needs to be constantly adjusted within meaningful firing rate limits. Neurons achieve such homeostatic plasticity by balancing ionic conductances via compensatory feedback in an activity-dependent manner (Turrigiano, 1999; West et al., 2001; Zhang and Linden, 2003). In this context, modulation of K+ channel expression represents a key molecular mechanism to regulate neuronal input\u2013output relationships (Zhang and Linden, 2003).The -related gene (ERG) channels represent a unique K+ channel subfamily that exhibits distinct gating and pharmacological properties (Schwarz and Bauer, 2004). In mice, the ERG subfamily is composed of three members [mERG1\u20133 (Warmke and Ganetzky, 1994; Shi et al., 1997)] with two splice variants of mERG1 [mERG1a and mERG1b (Lees-Miller et al., 1997; London et al., 1997)]. So far, most studies have focused on hERG, the human homolog of mERG1, which is a key mediator of cardiac action potential (AP) repolarization. Inherited hERG mutations cause long QT syndrome 2, a lethal arrhythmic disorder (Curran et al., 1995; Sanguinetti et al., 1995; Nerbonne and Kass, 2005). In neurons, however, the physiological roles of ERG channels are poorly understood (Sanguinetti and Tristani-Firouzi, 2006). Overlapping subunit expression in central neuron somata (Guasti et al., 2005) suggests that endogenous ERG channels form heterotetramers, likely coassembling with promiscuous \u03b2-subunits such as MinK-related peptides (MiRPs). A characteristic feature of ERG channels is their unconventional gating. Activated during depolarization, fast inactivation and a combination of fast recovery from inactivation and relatively slow deactivation during repolarization underlie inward net ion movement (Schwarz and Bauer, 2004). However, gating properties vary substantially between endogenous and heterologously expressed ERG channels and between subunits (Pond and Nerbonne, 2001; Hirdes et al., 2005). So far, neuronal ERG currents have been described in cerebellar Purkinje neurons (Sacco et al., 2003) and ventral horn interneurons (Furlan et al., 2007).Here, we analyzed activity-dependent K+ channel expression in the mouse VNO. Compared with stimulus-deprived animals, ERG1 channel expression is upregulated in mice chronically exposed to pheromonal cues. We show that basal neurons coexpress ERG1 and ERG3 and exhibit a fast ERG-mediated K+ current that is significantly reduced after stimulus deprivation. We demonstrate a function of ERG-mediated currents in VSN spike repolarization and show impaired AP firing after ERG channel inhibition. Together, our findings support a concept of homeostatic plasticity in the accessory olfactory system based on use-dependent regulation of ERG channel expression. This mechanism is ideally suited to adjust a target vomeronasal output range in a layer-specific manner.For tissue preparation and electrophysiological recordings, the following solutions were used: (1) HEPES-buffered extracellular solution (S1) containing (in mm) 145 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.3 (adjusted with NaOH), osmolarity of 300 mOsm (adjusted with glucose); (2) bicarbonate-buffered oxygenated (95% O2/5% CO2) extracellular solution (S2) containing (in mm) 120 NaCl, 25 NaHCO3, 5 KCl, 1 MgSO4, 1 CaCl2, 5 BES (,-bis[2-hydroxyethyl]-2-aminoethansulfonic acid), pH 7.3, osmolarity of 300 mOsm; (3) elevated potassium extracellular solution (S3) containing (in mm) 110 NaCl, 40 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.5 CaCl2, 5 EGTA (110 nm free Ca2+), 10 HEPES, tetrodotoxin (TTX; 0.5 \u03bcm), pH 7.3, osmolarity of 300 mOsm; (4) low Ca2+ solution (S4) for enzymatic tissue digestion containing (in mm) 135 NaCl, 5 EGTA, 4.25 CaCl2, 5 KCl, 10 NaOH, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.3, osmolarity of 300 mOsm; and (5) HEPES-buffered pipette solution containing (in mm) 143 KCl, 10 HEPES, 2 KOH, 0.3 CaCl2, 1 EGTA (110 nm free Ca2+), 1 MgATP, 0.5 NaGTP, pH 7.1 (adjusted with KOH), osmolarity of 290 mOsm. If not stated otherwise, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma.

Subunit-specific mERG1 currents were isolated using the recombinant peptide rBeKm-1 at a concentration (100 nm; Alomone Labs) that completely blocks mERG1 without affecting mERG3 (Restano-Cassulini et al., 2006).All animal procedures were in compliance with the European Union legislation on the protection of animals used for experimental purposes (Directive 86/609/EEC) and with recommendations put forward by the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations. Mice used for experiments shown in Figures 2\u20136 and supplemental Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 (available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), either wild-type C57BL/6 mice or gene-targeted mice in which all mature VSNs can be visualized based on homozygous expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the regulatory sequences of the olfactory marker protein () gene (OMP-GFP) (Potter et al., 2001), were housed in groups of both sexes at room temperature on a 12 h light/dark cycle with food and water available . If not stated otherwise, experiments used young adults of either sex. We did not observe any obvious differences between males and females in neither electrophysiological recordings nor molecular or immunochemical experiments.Mice were killed by CO2 asphyxiation and decapitation using sharp surgical scissors, following the \u201cguidelines for euthanasia of rodents using CO2\u201d recently issued by the National Institutes of Health Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare. The VNO was dissected in oxygenated, ice-cold S1 as described previously (Leinders-Zufall et al., 2000; Spehr et al., 2006). For preparations of acute slices, the intact VNO was embedded in 4% low-gelling-temperature agarose, and coronal slices (300 \u03bcm) were cut on a Vibratome (VT1000S; Leica Microsystems). Slices were transferred to a submerged (S2), chilled, and oxygenated storage chamber until use.C57BL/6 mice were killed as described (see above, VNO preparation). Brain, heart, and VNO tissue samples were removed and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted and purified from tissues and cultured LNCaP cells using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and DNase digestion. RNA from each sample was quantified using the NanoDrop ND-1000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Five micrograms of total RNA served as a template for oligo-dT- and random hexamer-primed first-strand cDNA synthesis using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (RT; Invitrogen). PCR was performed in a Mastercycler ep gradient S (Eppendorf) using DNA polymerase (Promega), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm of each dNTP, and 100 pm forward/reverse target-specific oligonucleotide primers. Cycling parameters consisted of an initial denaturation step at 94\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles (30 s each) of 94\u00b0C (step 1), primer pair-specific annealing temperature (step 2), and 72\u00b0C (step 3), and completed by a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 5 min. The following primer sequences and annealing temperatures were used to amplify target cDNA: ERG1a, 5\u2032-ATGCCGGTGCGGAGGGGCCAC-3\u2032 (fwd1)/5\u2032-TAGAAGGCGATCTCCACTTTG-3\u2032 (rev1)/temperature (T) = 55\u00b0C; ERG1b, 5\u2032-ATGGCGATTCCAACCGGGAAG-3\u2032 (fwd1)/5\u2032-ACAGTCAGGGGCTTGGGACCC-3\u2032 (rev1)/T = 60\u00b0C; ERG2, 5\u2032-ATGCCAGTCCGCAGGGGCCA-3\u2032 (fwd1)/5\u2032-CATCCACCAGGCAGCGGAAGC-3\u2032 (rev1)/T = 58\u00b0C; ERG3, 5\u2032-ATGCCTGTTCGCAGGGGGCAT-3\u2032 (fwd1)/5\u2032-CTGGGATTATGTGAGTGTTAC-3\u2032 (rev1)/T = 54\u00b0C; MiRP2. 5\u2032-ATGGAGACTTCCAACGGGAC-3\u2032 (fwd1)/5\u2032-GACCTGGTACATGAGCCTCC-3\u2032 (rev1)/T = 56\u00b0C. Primers were designed using Clone Manager software (Sci-Ed Software). The annealing temperature for each primer pair was calculated from their individual G/C and A/T content. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide (0.5 \u03bcg/ml), followed by a second amplification to check for weak or false amplification. For this nested PCR, 0.5 \u03bcl of the purified initial product served as a template, and the following primer sequences and annealing temperatures were used: ERG1a, 5\u2032-TCGCGCCGCAGAACACCTTCC-3\u2032 (fwd2)/5\u2032-CTCCTCTGCGCCCAGCAGGGC-3\u2032 (rev2)/T = 63\u00b0C; ERG1b, 5\u2032-CAGGGGCTCTGCAGCCCAGGG-3\u2032 (fwd2)/5\u2032-CTCCTTCAGCAGGAAGGCGGC-3\u2032 (rev2)/T = 62\u00b0C; ERG2, 5\u2032-CCAAAACACTTACTTGGACAC-3\u2032 (fwd2)/5\u2032-CTTGCGATAGTAGAGGATGTCC-3\u2032 (rev2)/T = 58\u00b0C; ERG3, 5\u2032-CTTCCTGGGGACCATCATACG-3\u2032 (fwd2)/5\u2032-CTTGTGATAGTAGGTGACC-3\u2032 (rev2)/T = 56\u00b0C; MiRP2, 5\u2032-TCAGATCATAGACACACGGTTC-3\u2032 (fwd2)/5\u2032-GATGTACACATGATAGGGGTC-3\u2032 (rev2)/T = 52\u00b0C. The identity of PCR products was confirmed by sequencing using the 3130xl Genetic Analyzer and BigDye Terminator version 3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems).Oligonucleotide microarray analyses were performed for eight individual RNA samples (four arrays from RNA of pheromone-stimulated mice [(experimental group/(exp)], four arrays of RNA from stimulus-deprived animals [(control group)/(contr)], each containing pooled vomeronasal RNA of five singly housed C57BL/6 male mice. Total RNA was isolated from VNO whole-organ preparations using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The quality (2100 bioanalyzer, RNA 6000 Pico LabChip; Agilent) and quantity (NanoDrop ND-1000) of this starting RNA were analyzed, and samples were only processed if the quality was satisfactory as indicated by the absence of degradation of ribosomal RNA (28S/18S rRNA ratios \u223c2). Synthesis of double-stranded cDNA, generation of biotinylated cRNA, hybridization to Mouse Genome430_2.0 arrays (Affymetrix), washing (GeneChip Fluidics Station 400), staining, and scanning of the arrays (GeneChip Scanner3000) were done as recommended (Expression_s2_manual; Affymetrix). RNA quality was additionally controlled by hybridization to Affymetrix Test 3 chips.Signal intensities, detection calls (present, absent, and marginal), and pairwise analyses of expression changes between experimental and control arrays were determined from processed array images using the GCOS1.4 software (Affymetrix), exported as Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, and processed using the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) software tool (available at http://www-stat.stanford.edu/\u223ctibs/SAM). GCOS1.4 software was used to calculate the average noise (2.55 \u00b1 0.1), the average background signal level (54.62 \u00b1 0.84), the average percentages of \u201cpresent\u201d and \u201cabsent\u201d calls (present, 54.96 \u00b1 0.72%; absent, 43.28 \u00b1 0.75%), the average signal level for all probe sets (1364.98 \u00b1 17), the average actin 3\u2032/5\u2032 signal ratio (1.41 \u00b1 0.03), and the average glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) 3\u2032/5\u2032 signal ratio (0.98 \u00b1 0.04). To monitor target labeling, poly-A controls (GeneChip Poly-A RNA Control kit) were spiked into RNA samples and called present on all arrays. The detailed quality report is available for download (www.rub.de/signaling). One array from stimulus-deprived controls did not meet conservative quality standards and was thus eliminated from additional analysis resulting in a total of seven replicates. A scaling across all probe sets of a given array to a target intensity of 1000 was included to compensate for variations in the amount and quality of the cRNA samples and other experimental variables. Transcripts were defined as differentially expressed between the stimulated mice and the odor-deprived controls if signal intensities met the following criteria: (1) the gene had to be consistently detected in at least 100% of the samples of either group; and (2) either pairwise statistical analyses of expression changes using a Mann\u2013Whitney test for independent samples showed a  value of  < 0.05 or random overlap matrix analysis of multiple pairwise comparisons (exp/contr vs contr/contr; under both conditions each transcript is compared 12 times) showed regulated expression only in exp/contr comparisons.The VNO was dissected as described (see above, VNO preparation). For preparation of cryosections, the VNO was fixed for 2 h in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (150 mm Tris-HCl and 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) at 4\u00b0C, decalcified overnight in 0.5 m EDTA, and cryoprotected in PBS containing 30% sucrose. The dehydrated VNO was embedded in Tissue Freezing Medium (Leica Microsystems) and sectioned at 25 \u03bcm on a cryostat (Leica Microsystems). The same protocol was used for sagittal cryosections of the cerebellum.For single neuron immunostainings, the VNO was minced and digested in 0.19 mg/ml papain and 1 U/ml DNase (Promega) in S4 for 20 min at 37\u00b0C. The tissue was then transferred to S1 solution and gently triturated using fire-polished glass pipettes saturated with bovine serum albumin (BSA). Nondissociated cells were removed from the cell suspension using BD Falcon Cell Strainer nylon meshes (70 \u03bcm pore diameter; Becton Dickinson). Dissociated VSNs were transferred to concanavalin A-coated glass-bottom dishes. After 30 min (4\u00b0C), VSNs had attached to the bottom of the dishes and were then fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (4\u00b0C).The following antibodies were used in this study: primary antisera include rabbit anti-KCNH2/anti-KCNH6/anti-KCNH7/anti-KCNE3 (ERG1/ERG2/ERG3/MiRP2; Alomone Labs), rabbit anti-V2R2 (kindly provided by Dr. R. Tirindelli, University of Parma, Parma, Italy), rabbit anti-PDE4A (Novus Biologicals), and rabbit anti-KCNH2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488, 532, and 633 (Invitrogen) were used as secondary antibodies. Unless indicated otherwise, blocking and staining procedures were identical for both dissociated VSNs and VNO cryosections. Blocking was performed for 1 h (cryosections) or 30 min (dissociated VSNs), respectively, in PBS containing 2% goat serum, 1% gelatin, and 0.2% Triton X-100 (blocking solution). Cells and sections were then incubated for 1 h (room temperature; dissociated VSNs) or overnight (4\u00b0C; cryosections) with affinity-purified primary antibody sera (1:500, ERG1/MiRP2/V2R2/PDE4A; 1:250, ERG2/ERG3) in blocking solution, washed in PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 (three times for 10 min, one time for 30 min), and incubated for 1 h (sections) or 30 min (VSNs) with Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (1:500; Invitrogen). Excess antibodies were removed by washing in PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 (three times for 10 min, one time for 30 min). For multilabeling of sections with primary antibodies from the same host species, we adopted a published protocol that uses Fab fragments for blocking and labeling (Leinders-Zufall et al., 2004). To control for nonspecific staining, experiments in which the primary antibodies were omitted were performed in parallel with each procedure.Fluorescent images were taken using an upright scanning confocal microscope (LSM510-Meta; Zeiss) equipped with a 10\u00d7 [water immersion, numerical aperture (n.a.) 0.30] and 40\u00d7 (water immersion, n.a. 0.80) objective. To eliminate cross talk between labels, the multitracking configuration was applied. Endogenously expressed GFP, as well as Alexa Fluor 488, was excited using the 488 nm line of an argon laser, and emitted fluorescence was captured using a bandpass filter (500\u2013550IR nm). Alexa Fluor 532 and 633 were excited using the 543 and 633 nm line of a helium/neon laser, respectively, and fluorescence was captured using a long-pass filter (560 nm; Alexa Fluor 532) or a bandpass filter (650\u2013710 nm; Alexa Fluor 633). In some experiments, cell nuclei were stained by brief incubation with DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Invitrogen). In such cases, a Ti:sapphire laser (Mai Tai; Spectra Physics), running at 800 nm, was used as a light source for multiphoton excitation. Digital images were uniformly adjusted for brightness and contrast using Adobe Photoshop CS3 (Adobe Systems).VNOs and control cells and tissues were homogenized in ice-cold S1 lysis buffer in the presence of Complete Mini protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche) using a Dounce homogenizer. All membrane preparation procedures were performed at 4\u00b0C. The homogenate was briefly sonicated and centrifuged for 10 min (1000 \u00d7 ). The supernatant was collected and ultracentrifuged (2 h, 49,000 \u00d7 ). The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer, and protein concentration was determined using a Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) standardized on BSA. Protein samples were solubilized in Laemmli buffer (20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 125 mm Tris-HCl, and 0.02% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8) and DTT (5%), and equal amounts of protein (35 \u03bcg) were fractionated by size using 8\u201315% (w/v) denaturing SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were transferred to Immobilon Transfer Membranes (Millipore) or nitrocellulose membrane (Protran; Whatman) using a Criterion Blotter wet-blotting system (Bio-Rad). Membranes were washed, stained with Ponceau S to control for protein transfer, and again washed with TBST (150 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4). Blocking was performed in 5% nonfat dry milk/TBST (Bio-Rad) for 1 h. Blots were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in 3% nonfat dry milk/TBST with affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibodies against human KCNH2 (anti-ERG1; 1:250) and human KCNE3 (anti-MiRP2; 1:750). Membranes were then washed (four times for 15 min) in TBST and incubated at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1 h; 1:10,000; Bio-Rad) in 3% nonfat dry milk/TBST. Blots were again washed in TBST (four times for 15 min), and antibody binding was detected using ECL Plus Western Blotting Reagent (GE Healthcare). To control for equal protein loading per lane, membranes were stripped using Restore Western Blot Stripping Buffer (Pierce), washed with TBST, blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dry milk/TBST, and reprobed for 1 h in 3% nonfat dry milk/TBST for expression of GAPDH and \u03b2-tubulin, respectively, using a mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (1:30,000; Abcam) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-\u03b2-tubulin antibody (1:2,500; Abcam). Blots were washed in TBST (four times for 15 min) and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG (1 h; 1:10,000; Bio-Rad), respectively. After washing in TBST (four times for 15 min), antibody binding was detected as described. After background correction, semiquantitative densitometry measurements of scanned immunoblot band intensities within standard-size rectangular regions of interest were performed using MetaMorph 7.1 imaging software (Universal Imaging Corporation). Calibrated pixel intensities were transformed into an optical density (OD) value according to OD = Log10 [255/(255 \u2212 gray value)]. The OD values of ERG1 and MiRP2 bands were normalized to their associated GAPDH and/or \u03b2-tubulin controls to compensate for variations in loading and transference.For electrophysiological recordings, VNO slices were transferred to a recording chamber (Slice Mini Chamber; Luigs & Neumann) and visualized using a Leica DM LFSA (Leica Microsystems) fixed-stage upright video microscope equipped with apochromatic water-immersion objectives and infrared-optimized differential interference contrast (DIC) optics. Slices were anchored via stainless steel wires with 0.1-mm-thick lycra threads and continuously superfused with oxygenated solution S2 (\u223c3 ml/min; gravity flow) at room temperature. Patch pipettes (5\u20137 M\u03a9) were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries with filament and fire-polished ends (1.50 mm outer diameter, 0.86 mm inner diameter; Science Products) on a PC-10 vertical two-step micropipette puller (Narishige Instruments) and fire polished using a MF-830 Microforge (Narishige Instruments). Pipettes were advanced toward individual neurons under optical control applying positive backpressure. After a G\u03a9 seal was obtained, gentle negative pressure was applied to establish the whole-cell configuration. An EPC-10 amplifier controlled by Patchmaster 2.20 software (HEKA Elektronik) was used for data acquisition. Both pipette (fast) and cell membrane (slow) capacitance, as well as series resistance (s; up to 85% correction, 10 \u03bcs lag), were monitored and automatically compensated throughout the experiment. Measured slow values served as an approximation of the cell-surface area for normalization of current amplitudes (i.e., current density). Only neurons exhibiting stable access resistances (change <10%) were used for analysis. Theoretical liquid junction potentials were calculated using JPCalcW software (Barry, 1994) and automatically corrected on-line.In voltage-clamp experiments, leak currents were subtracted using a P/-4 procedure. Signals were low-pass filtered (analog three- and four-pole Bessel filters in series) with an effective corner frequency (\u22123 dB) automatically adjusted to one-fifth to one-third of the sampling rate (5\u201320 kHz, depending on protocol). Because ERG channel gating characteristics result in effective inward rectification and ERG conductance is directly related to the external K+ concentration [K+]o, K+ currents (K(ERG)) were identified and studied with a standard high [K+]o extracellular solution (S3; calculated Nernst equilibrium potential for K+, \u221232.5 mV) (Sacco et al., 2003; Furlan et al., 2007; Hirdes et al., 2005), balanced [Ca2+]i/[Ca2+]o, and blocked voltage-gated Na+ channels (TTX; 0.5 \u03bcm). This treatment, however, demanded that VSNs were analyzed on a one-recording-per-slice basis. Solution exchange (S2 to S3) after break-in and application of drug-containing solutions was achieved by a custom-made, pressure-driven focal application device consisting of a software-controlled valve bank connected to a \u201cperfusion pencil.\u201d Between recordings, cells were kept at a holding potential (hold) of \u221280 mV. Individual voltage-step protocols are described in Results. To analyze K(ERG) during AP discharge, prerecorded APs elicited by positive current injections were used as the command waveform (AP clamp).In current-clamp experiments, slices were perfused with extracellular solution S2. The resting membrane potential was measured directly after obtaining access to the cell interior using the software-controlled \u201cgentle switch\u201d of the EPC-10 patch-clamp amplifier. The membrane potential was then set to \u221275 mV by injecting a constant holding current (\u00b13 pA or less). AP discharge patterns were investigated by delivering depolarizing current injections of variable duration and intensity.Statistical analysis of paired or unpaired two-sample distributions was performed as dictated by data distribution. Results of individual serial randomness tests for normally distributed random samples and subsequent  tests for equal variances determined the use of either  tests or Wilcoxon rank tests. If not stated otherwise, a  value <0.01 was considered significant, and results are presented as means \u00b1 SEM.Electrophysiological data were analyzed off-line using FitMaster 2.20 (HEKA Elektronik), IGOR Pro 6.03A (WaveMetrics), and Excel (Microsoft) software. Activation curves were fitted by the Boltzmann equation /max = max/{1 + exp [(1/2 \u2212 )/]}, where 1/2 is the voltage that produces half-maximal activation and  is the slope factor. Decay time constants (\u03c4) for current deactivation were calculated by fitting individual traces during a fixed time period (2\u201325 ms after repolarization) to monoexponential functions (t) = 1 [exp (\u2212 \u03c4)] + 0, where (t) is the current at time , 1 is the initial amplitude, \u03c4 is the decay time constant, and 0 is the residual current. Event detection and spike analysis was performed using the Neuromatic 1.86 software package (written by Jason Rothman) implemented in IGOR Pro 6.03A and MiniAnalysis software (Synaptosoft).In voltage- and current-clamp recordings, Alexa Fluor 488 hydrazide (20 \u03bcm; Invitrogen) was routinely added to the pipette solution for on-line  visualization of VSN morphology,  immunocytochemical analysis, and three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction. After break-in, cells were loaded via diffusion. Whole-cell configuration was maintained for at least 20 min to allow for adequate dye filling. After recording, slices were immersion fixed for 30 min at 4\u00b0C in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for immunocytochemistry as described above. The morphology of dye-filled cells was studied using an upright scanning confocal microscope (LSM510-Meta; Zeiss) equipped as described above. For 3-D reconstruction of fluorescently labeled VSNs, axial projections of optical section stacks (0.7\u20131.1 \u03bcm z-step intervals) were generated as transparencies using a 3-D projection algorithm implemented in the confocal imaging software (Zeiss).In many neurons, the balance of intrinsic ionic conductances is constantly adjusted as a function of ongoing activity. One mechanism to set a target output range is regulated expression of specific K+ channels (Zhang and Linden, 2003). To determine whether transcription of K+ channel genes is activity regulated in the mouse VNO, we surveyed expression profiles of adult male C57BL/6 mice that had been singly housed either in an essentially odor-free environment (deprived group) or exposed to rich sources of pheromonal cues (stimulated group). Stimulation cycles (7 d) were composed of 6 h exposure to fresh male urine (2:00\u20138:00 P.M.), 12 h exposure to female-soiled bedding (8:00 P.M. to 8:00 A.M.), and an additional 6 h without stimulation (8:00 A.M. to 2:00 P.M.) to allow for relief from potential sensory adaptation (Fig. 1). Vomeronasal K+ channel transcription levels were compared between stimulated and deprived tissue using a total of seven Affymetrix microarrays (four experiment and three control replicates), each chip probing pooled mRNA from five animals. Applying conservative quality control and evaluation criteria (see Materials and Methods), 5 K+ channel genes were found both consistently detected and differentially expressed (Fig. 1; see supplemental Table 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material, for a summary of results). The most pronounced changes were observed for  (upregulation) and the modulatory single transmembrane domain \u03b2-subunit  (downregulation), which was reported to inhibit ERG1 currents when coexpressed in  oocytes (Schroeder et al., 2000). We next determined vomeronasal expression of  and  by RT-PCR. Using specific primers for both  isoforms ( and ), , , and , we detected transcripts of all genes. Transcript identity was confirmed by nested PCR (Fig. 1) and sequencing. Bands of the appropriate size were also obtained from cerebellum (Papa et al., 2003; Guasti et al., 2005) and heart (, , and ) (Shi et al., 1997) but not from cultured prostate cancer cells (LNCaP).Activity-dependent K+ channel gene expression in the VNO. , Schematic diagram illustrating the experimental strategy used for pheromone exposure (left) and stimulus deprivation (right) of singly housed C57BL/6 mice. , Differentially expressed K+ channel genes in the VNO. Analysis (see Materials and Methods) of seven microarrays (4 stimulated/3 deprived) reveals both consistent expression (7 of 7 arrays) and significant ( \u2264 0.029) regulation of the following genes:  (; up),  (up),  (; down),  (down), and  (down). For each gene, RefSeq accession numbers, Affymetrix identifications, and average fold changes (mean \u00b1 SEM; 12 independent comparisons) are specified. , Vomeronasal transcripts of both ERG1 isoforms (ERG1a and ERG1b), ERG3, and MiRP2 are detected by RT-PCR and sequencing. Specificity is confirmed by positive [cerebellum; heart (ERG1a, ERG1b, MiRP2)] and negative [heart (ERG3); LNCaP cells] controls. No PCR product is amplified when reverse transcription is omitted (control). , , Representative immunoblotting experiments illustrating the regulation of ERG1 and MiRP2 protein expression. Individual blot panels ( or ) correspond to the same SDS-polyacrylamide gel, respectively. , Western blot analysis demonstrating increased levels of vomeronasal ERG1a/1b expression in stimulated mice versus deprived mice. Blots ( = 4) were additionally probed for \u03b2-tubulin and GAPDH as loading controls. , Western blots ( = 3) probed with MiRP2 antibody reveal downregulated protein expression in stimulated animals.Next, we aimed to examine activity-dependent changes in ERG1a, ERG1b, and MiRP2 expression on the protein level. In ERG1 immunoblot analyses, the antibody detects two bands at \u223c165 and \u223c100 kDa in VNO protein extracts (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), corresponding to -glycosylated ERG1a and ERG1b (Pond et al., 2000; Hirdes et al., 2005). Equivalent bands were not detected in eye or LNCaP protein extracts. Probing blots of VNO and brain protein with an anti-MiRP2 antibody revealed bands of the expected size (\u223c20 kDa) (McCrossan et al., 2003) in both tissues (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). An anti-ERG3 antibody detected a single band of \u223c105 kDa in blots of both cerebellum and VNO (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). An anti-ERG2 antibody, however, stained multiple bands in the expected 100\u2013110 kDa range in the cerebellum but not the VNO (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), suggesting no or only marginal translation of ERG2 transcripts in vomeronasal tissue. Using the exact same stimulation/deprivation protocol as described above (Fig. 1), pooled VNO protein from stimulated ( = 10) and deprived ( = 12) mice, respectively, was subjected to immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1,). \u03b2- and  were found at constant levels in microarray experiments and thus served as loading controls. All antibodies detected distinct bands of the expected molecular size. Comparing stimulated and deprived mice, however, revealed substantial differences in band intensity for ERG1a, ERG1b ( = 4), and MiRP2 ( = 3). For stimulus-exposed animals, prominent bands were detected for ERG1a and ERG1b (Fig. 1), whereas labeling intensity was much weaker in samples from deprived mice. An opposite regulation was observed for MiRP2 (Fig. 1). These results were confirmed by semiquantitative densitometry measurements of scanned immunoblot band intensities (supplemental Fig. 1). Thus, the activity-dependent regulation of  and  K+ channel transcripts we identified by microarray profiling is effectively translated into upregulated (ERG1 isoforms) and downregulated (MiRP2) protein levels in the adult mouse VNO.To analyze the spatial distribution of vomeronasal ERG and MiRP2 channel subunits, we performed immunocytochemistry in coronal VNO sections from both C57BL/6 and transgenic OMP-GFP mice. In the gene-targeted animals, all VSNs express GFP under the control of the  promoter (Potter et al., 2001). Double-labeling experiments using antibodies against ERG1\u20133 or MiRP2 together with layer-specific markers of apical neurons [phosphodiesterase 4a (PDE4a) (Lau and Cherry, 2000)] or basal VSNs [V2R2 (Martini et al., 2001)] (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) revealed coexpression of ERG1, ERG3, and MiRP2 in basal neurons (Fig. 2,; supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). To control for nonspecific staining, we performed immunocytochemical experiments in which primary antibodies were preadsorbed with their corresponding antigenic peptides (supplemental Fig. 2,, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). In addition, we routinely performed parallel experiments in which primary antibodies were omitted (supplemental Fig. 3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).Coexpression of ERG1 and ERG3 in basal VSNs. , Confocal images of immunostainings in VNO cryosections from OMP-GFP mice (GFP fluorescence; gray scale; 1) show costaining of ERG1 (red; 2) and V2R2 (green; 3). High-magnification images (right) reveal overlapping staining in the VSN somata and dendritic tips. , Representative high-magnification confocal images of the VNO sensory epithelium in a coronal section (25 \u03bcm) from an OMP-GFP mouse. GFP fluorescence in mature VSNs is depicted in gray scale (1), ERG1-immunopositive cells are shown in green (2), and ERG3-positive VSNs are shown in red (3). Merged images clearly reveal coexpression of ERG1 and ERG3 in basal VSN somata. In contrast to ERG1 immunoreactivity, ERG3 staining is not observed in the microvillous layer. , Confocal images of ERG2 immunostainings in VNO sections from OMP-GFP mice (GFP fluorescence, gray scale, 1; anti-ERG2 signal is shown in red, 2). Merged photomicrographs reveal essentially no ERG2-positive VSNs. BV, Blood vessel; L, lumen; ML, microvillous layer; SCL, sustentacular cell layer.In sections from OMP-GFP mice, merged images of anti-ERG1 and anti-V2R2 labeling show overlapping staining in both the somata and dendritic tips of basal VSNs (Fig. 2). In contrast, a spatially restricted pattern was observed by anti-ERG1/anti-PDE4a double labeling (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). PDE4a staining was confined to apical cells, whereas essentially nonoverlapping ERG1 labeling was detected in basal neurons. The same results were obtained using another ERG1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; data not shown). Costainings of ERG1 and MiRP2 (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) as well as ERG1 and ERG3 (Fig. 2) indicate coexpression of all three subunits. Immunostainings against ERG2, however, showed no VSN-specific labeling (Fig. 2). As positive controls, we immunostained sagittal sections of the cerebellum in which expression of all ERG subunits had previously been reported (Papa et al., 2003; Guasti et al., 2005). Immunoreactivity for ERG1, ERG2, and ERG3 was detected in Purkinje neurons (supplemental Fig. 3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Consistent with semiquantitative immunoblotting results (Fig. 1), when parallel ERG1 immunostainings were performed on VNO cryosections from stimulated ( = 3) and deprived ( = 3) mice under the exact same conditions, an increase in both fluorescence intensity and the amount of labeled neurons became apparent (supplemental Fig. 3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).The subcellular distribution of ERG1 and MiRP2 was assessed in dissociated VSNs from OMP-GFP mice (supplemental Fig. 4,, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). In immunopositive neurons ( = 5), ERG1 reactivity was evident in the entire cell body. In contrast, MiRP2 staining was most prominent in the soma and dendrite ( = 4) but absent in the knob and microvilli. This pattern confirmed results obtained in whole-organ sections (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Together, these data show that both ERG1 isoforms (1a and 1b) as well as ERG3 and MiRP2 are coexpressed in basal neurons of the mouse VNO.We next asked whether ERG channel expression is reflected by voltage-dependent K+ currents (K(ERG)). Therefore, we obtained whole-cell recordings from optically identified neurons in acute VNO slices (Kelliher et al., 2006). After break-in, physiological saline was replaced by S3. Exchange was monitored by the gradual block of voltage-gated Na+ inward currents in response to step depolarizations [supplemental Fig. 4, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material; note the increase in tail current amplitude (arrowhead)]. In all recordings, step protocols were applied before and after incubation with highly specific ERG inhibitors: either the methanesulfonanilide E-4031 (10 \u03bcm) (Spector et al., 1996) or the scorpion toxin ErgTx-1 (100 nm) (Gurrola et al., 1999). Digital subtraction of currents recorded in the presence of either drug from control recordings revealed the ERG-mediated component.To investigate the voltage dependence of  steady-state activation, a 750 ms prepulse to variable potentials (\u221270 to 60 mV) was followed by a step to \u2212120 mV (100 ms). After hyperpolarization, rapid recovery from inactivation and slower deactivation induced an E-4031-sensitive tail current in 16 of 27 VSNs (59%) (Fig. 3). During depolarization, we observed a substantial E-4031-sensitive steady-state outward current, likely attributable to activation of ERG3. This subunit shows fast activation kinetics and slow steady-state inactivation (Shi et al., 1997; McKay and Huizinga, 2006), resulting in weak inward rectification (Wimmers et al., 2002). Eleven of 27 neurons showed no drug-sensitive current (Fig. 3). To ensure that diminished tail currents did not result from current rundown, we performed controls in the absence of inhibitors (supplemental Fig. 4, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Up to 10 min, essentially no rundown was observed.Activation of ERG-mediated K+ currents in vomeronasal neurons. , , Representative whole-cell patch-clamp recording traces. Tail currents were elicited in the absence (control) and presence of E-4031 (10 \u03bcm) by hyperpolarization to \u2212120 mV (inset, pulse protocol). ERG-mediated currents ( = 16) are computed as drug-sensitive components after digital off-line subtraction (control \u2212 E-4031). Eleven neurons showed no drug-sensitive currents (). , ,  steady-state activation curves of both E-4031-sensitive (filled circles;  = 16) and ErgTx-1-sensitive (100 nm; filled triangles;  = 14) currents. Curves illustrate average current densities () or normalized current amplitudes (; /max) versus prepulse potential. Data points are fitted by the Boltzmann equation (see Results). With one exception (; \u221240 mV), no significant differences in current isolation were observed between inhibitors. , Time course of vomeronasal ERG current activation (inset, \u201cenvelope of tail currents\u201d pulse protocol). , Representative original recording after digital current subtraction (control \u2212 E-4031). On expanded coordinates (dotted square area), note the increase in current amplitude during prolonged depolarization. , Average tail current densities increased with prepulse duration (monoexponential fit extrapolated to 0 pA/pF: \u03c4act = 194 ms;  = 13). , On a logarithmic time scale, normalized tail currents (/max) increase in a linear manner (half-maximal activation at a prepulse duration of 25.8 ms).When peak tail current density is plotted as a function of prepulse depolarization (Fig. 3), a similar voltage dependence is seen for E-4031-sensitive VSNs ( = 16 of 27) and ErgTx-1-sensitive neurons ( = 14 of 18). Normalization of tail currents (Fig. 3) provides a reasonable estimate for the activated channel fraction (open or inactivated state) before repolarization. Using the Boltzmann equation to fit the activation curves, we obtained half-maximal activation values (1/2) of \u221213.8 mV (E-4031) and \u22127.1 mV (ErgTx-1) and slope factors  = 17 (E-4031) and  = 16 (ErgTx-1), respectively. These data show that, although channels begin to activate at subthreshold potentials, a considerable membrane depolarization is required to evoke substantial channel activation.In addition to voltage-dependent gating characteristics, ion channel function is determined by gating kinetics. To investigate ERG channel activation kinetics in VSNs, we applied an envelope of tail current protocol (Schonherr et al., 1999; Sturm et al., 2005). Depolarizing prepulses (40 mV) of increasing duration (5\u20132310 ms; increment factor, 1.55) were followed by hyperpolarization to \u2212120 mV (Fig. 3). When current densities were plotted as a function of prepulse duration (Fig. 3,), K(ERG) amplitude increased exponentially with a time constant \u03c4act = 194 ms ( = 13). Similar values were reported for recombinant rERG channels [\u03c4act = 95 ms (rERG3) to 215/123 ms (rERG1a/rERG1b)] (Hirdes et al., 2005). However, we observed a significant current (\u221237.3 \u00b1 11.2 pA/pF) even at 5 ms depolarizations (Fig. 3), corresponding to 34.4 \u00b1 5.3% of open channels [current normalization (/max) on a semilogarithmic scale] (Fig. 3). Half-maximal activation was observed after 25.8 ms. These results indicate that, provided a substantial membrane depolarization, a considerable fraction of vomeronasal ERG channels displays a relatively rapid time course of activation.The combination of fast recovery from inactivation and relatively slow deactivation is a characteristic feature of ERG channels (Schwarz and Bauer, 2004) underlying their role in membrane repolarization and modulation of excitability. Therefore, we next studied vomeronasal ERG current availability after repolarization. VSNs were depolarized (40 mV) for 500 ms to fully activate/inactivate ERG channels. After repolarization to variable potentials (\u221210 to \u2212120 mV, 100 ms), drug-sensitive tail current amplitudes and deactivation kinetics are clearly voltage dependent (Fig. 4). Forty-nine percent (25 of 51; E-4031) and 53% (8 of 15; ErgTx-1) of all neurons, respectively, exhibited ERG-mediated currents (Fig. 4), whereas no currents were detected in the remaining 26 (E-4031) and 7 (ErgTx-1) VSNs (Fig. 4). K(ERG)  steady-state inactivation curves were derived from peak current densities and fitted by the Boltzmann equation. No significant amplitude differences (one exception at \u221230 mV), similar 1/2 values for half-maximal recovery from inactivation (E-4031, \u221262.3 mV; ErgTx-1, \u221263.8 mV), and slope factors (E-4031,  = 19; ErgTx-1,  = 17) illustrate the effective isolation of vomeronasal ERG currents using either blocker (Fig. 4,). Using S3, the calculated Nernst equilibrium potential for K+ is \u221232.5 mV. Individual normalized K(ERG) availability curves reversed, on average, at \u221230.5 \u00b1 1.5 mV (ErgTx-1;  = 6) and \u221226.7 \u00b1 1.3 mV (E-4031;  = 10;  = 0.078), respectively, confirming the K+ selectivity. Notably, at potentials of \u221260 mV or less, K(ERG) deactivation was not complete after 100 ms (Fig. 4, expanded traces). When plotting average amplitudes, at 95 \u00b1 5 ms after repolarization, versus membrane potential (Fig. 4), this \u201csteady-state\u201d current becomes apparent (E-4031,  = 13; ErgTx-1,  = 8).Voltage dependence of ERG channel deactivation. , ERG current availability depends on the degree of repolarization. , Representative original tail currents recorded during repolarization steps to variable membrane potentials (\u221210 to \u2212120 mV; inset, pulse protocol). Recordings are shown under control conditions, in the presence of E-4031 (10 \u03bcm) and after digital off-line subtraction (control \u2212 E-4031). On expanded coordinates (dotted square area; left), the voltage dependence of current availability becomes obvious ( = 25). , In 26 VSNs, essentially no drug-sensitive currents could be isolated. , ,  steady-state K(ERG) inactivation curves derived from peak current densities () or normalized current amplitudes (; /max) and plotted as a function of the repolarization voltage [filled circles, E-4031,  = 25; filled triangles, ErgTx-1 (100 nm),  = 8]. Data points are fitted by the Boltzmann equation. With one exception (; \u221230 mV), no significant differences are observed between curves derived using either inhibitor. , Steady-state current density after 95 ms of repolarization (E-4031,  = 13; ErgTx-1,  = 8). At membrane potentials of \u221260 mV or less, a nondeactivating or slowly deactivating current is recorded (; expanded dotted square area; right). Trend lines were extrapolated using a Gauss function. , , Voltage dependence of deactivation kinetics (filled circles, E-4031,  = 16; filled triangles, ErgTx-1,  = 5). \u03c4deact was determined by single-exponential fits during a fixed time period (2\u201325 ms after repolarization). On a semilogarithmic scale (), \u03c4deact versus repolarization potential shows a linear relationship. When \u03c4deact values are normalized to data obtained at \u221260 mV (), no differences in deactivation kinetics are observed using either ERG inhibitor.On expanded coordinates (Fig. 4), the voltage dependence of deactivation becomes evident. Tail current decay was fitted by a single exponential function (gray dashed line) to determine deactivation time constants (\u03c4deact). Currents elicited by strong hyperpolarization (Fig. 4, \u2212120 mV trace) deactivated faster than currents evoked by step repolarization to less negative potentials (Fig. 4, \u221290 mV trace). This characteristic of ERG channels was quantified by plotting \u03c4deact versus the repolarization potential (Fig. 4,). On a semilogarithmic scale, the voltage dependence of \u03c4deact was linear (Fig. 4). Normalization to values recorded at \u221260 mV (E-4031: 21.5 \u00b1 2.6 ms,  = 16; ErgTx-1: 20.3 \u00b1 5 ms,  = 5) reveals no inhibitor-related differences (Fig. 4). Together, substantial ERG-mediated K+ current, consisting of both a deactivating tail and a steady-state current component, is available in basal VSNs during fast repolarization to subthreshold membrane potentials.K+ channel profiling and semiquantitative immunochemistry revealed activity-dependent upregulation of  expression (Fig. 1). Therefore, we aimed to dissect the role of this specific subunit in generation of vomeronasal ERG currents using a pharmacological approach. In contrast to the less selective agents E-4031 and ErgTx-1, the recombinant peptide rBeKm-1 completely blocks ERG1 at nanomolar concentrations without affecting other channels including ERG3 (Korolkova et al., 2001; Restano-Cassulini et al., 2006). We, thus, repeated various experiments shown in Figures 3 and 4 using rBeKm-1 (100 nm) to study activation, recovery from inactivation, and deactivation of isolated ERG1-mediated currents (Fig. 5). Eight of 15 VSNs (53%) showed rBeKm-1-sensitive currents.  steady-state activation was compared with data obtained when blocking all subunits using E-4031 (Fig. 5). We found significantly smaller rBeKm-1-sensitive current amplitudes at positive potentials. Activation curves showed similar 1/2 values for currents isolated by rBeKm-1 (\u221218.6 mV) and E-4031 (\u221213.8 mV). However, the slope of the rBeKm-1 curve ( = 23.8) was considerably more shallow than for currents isolated by E-4031 ( = 17). In experiments addressing current availability after repolarization (Fig. 5), significantly decreased amplitudes are observed in rBeKm-1-treated VSNs after repolarization to membrane potentials of \u221280 mV or less. Moreover, half-maximal recovery from inactivation and slope factors were different (E-4031: \u221260.3 mV,  = 19; rBeKm-1: \u221271.5 mV,  = 25). Notably, no differences in the nondeactivation current component were found using either treatment (Fig. 5), suggesting that the steady-state current is predominantly, if not exclusively, mediated by homomeric or heteromeric ERG1 channels. In summary, these data indicate that the ERG1 subunit(s) contributes substantially to the total ERG-mediated current. However, a small but significant fraction is carried by rBeKm-1-insensitive subunits.Substantial contribution of the ERG1 channel subunit to vomeronasal K(ERG). ,  steady-state activation of vomeronasal ERG currents (see Fig. 3) [filled circles, E-4031 (10 \u03bcm),  = 16; filled squares, rBeKm-1 (100 nm),  = 8]. Current densities are shown as a function of prepulse potential and fitted by the Boltzmann equation. At depolarization to positive voltages (10\u201340 mV and 60 mV), rBeKm-1-sensitive amplitudes are significantly smaller than currents isolated using the nonsubunit-selective agent E-4031 ( < 0.05). , Significant differences in channel availability after repolarization (filled squares, rBeKm-1,  = 8; filled circles, E-4031,  = 25). Inactivation curves show significantly decreased peak densities for ERG1-specific currents at potentials of \u221280 mV or less ( < 0.05). , Similar steady-state current characteristics are detected using either pharmacological treatment. Trend lines are calculated using a Gauss function.Immunochemistry revealed that ERG subunits are exclusively found in basal neurons (Fig. 2; supplemental Figs. 2, 3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). If so, ERG-mediated currents should only be expressed in \u223c50% of all VSNs. Indeed, we observed K(ERG) in 53% (41 of 78; E-4031), 67% (22 of 33; ErgTx-1), and 53% (8 of 15; rBeKm-1) of investigated neurons. To consolidate these findings, we labeled several VSNs ( = 11) during voltage-clamp analysis by adding Alexa488 hydrazide (20 \u03bcm) to the pipette solution. This allowed on-line  visualization of VSN morphology (Fig. 6, left and middle),  immunocytochemical analysis (Fig. 6), and 3-D reconstruction (Fig. 6, right ( = 7) (supplemental Movie 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). All labeled neurons exhibited an intact cytoarchitecture. Given the rather diffuse zonal boundary in the VNO (Fig. 2; supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) (Martini et al., 2001; Leinders-Zufall et al., 2004), it was, however, impossible to infer basal or apical identity of a given neuron simply from  visualization. We therefore determined cell identity by  immunocytochemistry using anti-V2R2 (Fig. 6,), anti-PDE4a (Fig. 6,), and anti-ERG1 (Fig. 6) antibodies. All labeled VSNs that showed ERG-mediated currents ( = 8) were immunopositive for either ERG1 ( = 4) or V2R2 ( = 2) or showed no PDE4a staining ( = 2), respectively (Fig. 6,). In contrast, cells that exhibited no current ( = 3) were either negative for V2R2 (Fig. 6) or ERG1 (Fig. 6) or strongly stained by the anti-PDE4a (Fig. 6) antibody. ERG-mediated currents are thus unique to basal V2R-expressing neurons.Sensory activity controls ERG K+ channel expression and function in basal VSNs. , During whole-cell experiments, cells were fluorescently labeled via diffusion of Alexa488 for  visualization,  immunocytochemical analysis, and 3-D reconstruction of VSN morphology. Left, Overlay of two photomicrographs of an acute VNO slice taken under infrared-DIC illumination and epifluorescence, respectively. The soma (black arrowhead) of the VSN under investigation is visualized by dye diffusion from the pipette. Middle, Low-magnification bright-field image of a VNO slice after recording. Under epifluorescence, the recorded neuron is readily identified (inset). Right, 3-D reconstruction of the same fluorescently labeled VSN shown before (middle; inset). An axial transparency projection is generated from confocal z-stacks (supplemental Movie 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). , Layer-specific classification of Alexa488-labeled VSNs by  immunocytochemistry. V2R2, PDE4a, or ERG1 counterstaining shows that VSNs that exhibited ERG currents in previous voltage-clamp recordings ( = 8) are V2R2 positive () or PDE4a negative (), respectively, whereas neurons that showed no ERG-dependent currents are either negative for V2R2 () or ERG1 () or PDE4a positive (). , ERG currents are reduced in VSNs of stimulus-deprived mice. , , Activation curves of either E-4031-sensitive () or rBeKm-1-sensitive () ERG currents from stimulus-deprived (filled diamonds; ,  = 9; ,  = 11) and control (, filled circles,  = 16; , filled squares,  = 8) animals.

To address this question, we recorded ERG-mediated currents in optically identified basal VSNs (Kelliher et al., 2006) from stimulus-deprived animals ( = 9). Using the same pulse protocols as shown in Figures 3 and 4, we recorded both E-4031- and rBeKm-1-sensitive tail currents as a function of either prepulse (Fig. 6,) or repolarization (Fig. 6,) potential, respectively. Indeed, using either E-4031 to isolate total ERG currents or rBeKm-1 to specifically isolate the ERG1-dependent component, current densities were significantly reduced in VSNs from deprived mice. When data from deprived animals (E-4031) were fitted by the Boltzmann equation, the slopes of both the K(ERG) activation ( = 20) and the availability curve ( = 27) were considerably shallower than observed for control neurons ( = 17/19) (Fig. 6,), indicating not only a reduced density of functional channels but also a relative change in subunit composition. Notably, when ERG1-specific currents were isolated from VSNs of control versus deprived mice using rBeKm-1, we observed significantly reduced current densities in deprived mice (Fig. 6,), indicating that the substantial reduction in total K(ERG) in VSNs from stimulus-deprived mice is, at least in part, attributable to decreased ERG1 expression. This conclusion is supported by the fact that we never observed a nondeactivating current in deprived mice. Because rBeKm-1-sensitive steady-state currents were almost indistinguishable from controls (Fig. 5), this lack of a steady-state current supports the concept of ERG1 being a critical subunit for incomplete deactivation at hyperpolarized voltages.Several biophysical characteristics of vomeronasal ERG currents suggest a potential function in AP repolarization. First, considerable membrane depolarization (e.g., during AP overshoot) is required to evoke substantial activation (Fig. 3,). Second, significant currents are observed even at preceding depolarizations as short as 5 ms (Fig. 3). Third, little inactivation occurs during depolarization (Fig. 3). Do ERG channels thus contribute to spike repolarization in VSNs? To clarify this question, we recorded E-4031-sensitive currents using the AP clamp technique. Prerecorded AP trains elicited by positive current injection into VSNs were applied as the command waveforms (black traces). This way, vomeronasal ERG channels experience the same trajectory of voltage as during naturally occurring APs (Bean, 2007). Figure 7 shows a drug-sensitive current that is rapidly activated and shifted from outward to inward during the repolarizing phase ( = 24). On expanded coordinates (Fig. 7, right), this current reversed close to the calculated Nernst K+ equilibrium potential of \u221232.5 mV (red dotted lines), reached a peak close to the point of maximal repolarization (\u221270 mV; black dotted lines), and decayed exponentially with a mean time constant of \u03c4deact = 17.9 \u00b1 4.3 ms.Activation of K(ERG) during VSN AP repolarization. , When prerecorded VSN spike trains are applied as the command voltage (AP clamp; black waveforms), E-4031-sensitive currents are observed after digital subtraction (red trace;  = 24). A single representative event (dotted square) is shown at higher resolution (right). During AP discharge, an outward current is activated that reverses direction during repolarization, reaches a maximum at \u221270 mV (black dotted lines), and decays exponentially. The observed reversal potential is close to the calculated Nernst K+ equilibrium potential of \u221232.5 mV (red dotted lines). , Representative AP clamp recording (left; red trace) at a command voltage spike train displaying frequency adaptation (black). Quantitative analysis (right) of ERG current amplitudes versus interspike intervals is shown. Total K(ERG) is isolated from control VSNs using E-4031 (10 \u03bcm;  = 14; black circles, solid line), whereas ERG1-dependent currents are isolated by rBeKm-1 [100 nm; black squares, dashed line (control,  = 14); red diamonds, solid line (deprived,  = 9)]. Current densities decrease exponentially with prolonged interspike intervals. In VSNs from deprived animals, K(ERG) is significantly reduced ( \u2264 0.05).We next asked whether the duration of interspike episodes affects the ERG current amplitude. Frequency-dependent ERG current accumulation has previously been observed (Chiesa et al., 1997; Schonherr et al., 1999). When a train of VSN APs, showing spike frequency adaptation during constant current injection, was used as a stimulus template, ERG amplitudes decreased with prolonged interspike intervals (Fig. 7) (control/E-4031,  = 14; control/rBeKm-1,  = 14; deprived/rBeKm-1,  = 9). At discharge intervals longer than \u223c150 ms, however, peak current densities remain relatively stable, indicating that at frequencies \u22657 Hz incomplete ERG channel deactivation between spikes could lead to current accumulation. Moreover, AP-driven ERG currents are strongly ERG1 dependent (Fig. 7, right). Total K(ERG) amplitudes (E-4031) and the ERG1-specific current component (rBeKm-1) are not statistically different, although the latter tends to be consistently smaller. In VSNs from deprived animals, however, ERG1-dependent current flow during AP discharge is strongly reduced (red graph). In summary, these data show that considerable ERG1-dependent currents flow during the late repolarizing phase of vomeronasal AP discharge.What is the physiological relevance of ERG channel activation during AP firing? We addressed this question by recording VSN input\u2013output relationships in current-clamp configuration (supplemental material, available at www.jneurosci.org) under physiological ionic conditions. The majority of VSNs were spontaneously active at rest. We therefore injected a constant hyperpolarizing current (\u22120.5 to \u22123 pA) to keep M as close as possible to \u221275 mV, thereby abolishing spontaneous firing. First, we investigated VSN output in response to a naturally occurring receptor current profile. We designed a current injection protocol that mimicked a basal VSN response that we recorded after application of diluted urine (Fig. 8, gray box, top). This protocol was applied for five cycles of increasing duration (Fig. 8, gray box, bottom, a\u2013e). VSN firing patterns were analyzed in the absence and presence of E-4031 (10 \u03bcm). Six of 13 VSNs showed a dramatic effect on AP firing. In these neurons, the number of spikes was significantly reduced after drug incubation (Fig. 8). Notably, this effect was most pronounced during the initial phase of high-amplitude current injection (25 \u2212 7 pA). Here, we frequently observed that VSNs ceased firing after one or a few initial spikes, but returned to a tonic discharge pattern during small-amplitude current injection (7 \u2212 2 pA) (Fig. 8, traces d and e). Analog results were obtained from analysis of firing patterns in deprived mice (Fig. 8,, red) ( = 36). These data suggest that, by ensuring a sufficient level of membrane repolarization, vomeronasal ERG currents could play a critical role during periods of strong sensory activation.ERG channels determine the output range of basal vomeronasal neurons. , Representative AP discharge patterns induced by current injections. The injection protocol (gray box) mimics a prerecorded VSN receptor current profile in response to focal application of diluted urine (1:100; red trace). High-frequency firing is impaired in response to current injections both after ERG channel inhibition and VSNs of stimulus-deprived animals. Lowercase letters indicate corresponding injection protocols. , Mean number of spikes versus current injection length () in control VSNs ( = 6; black circles, solid line), after ERG channel inhibition ( = 6; black diamonds, dashed line), and in VSNs from deprived animals ( = 36; red diamonds, solid line). Drug incubation and deprivation significantly reduce the total spike count at durations \u2265500 ms ( \u2264 0.05). , Typical firing responses induced by constant 1 s depolarizing current steps of variable amplitude (4\u201340 pA; 4 pA increments). Note the continuous decline in AP amplitude (deprivation/ERG channel inhibition) as a putative result from reduced membrane repolarization and, consequentially, insufficient recovery from Na+ channel inactivation. , Mean firing frequency versus current amplitude ( curve). For amplitudes \u22654 pA (deprived,  = 30) or \u22658 pA (E-4031,  = 11), respectively, the frequency is significantly reduced ( < 0.005). Under control conditions, firing rates approximate a maximum frequency of \u223c25 Hz. After deprivation or ERG channel inhibition, the  curve shows a more bell-shaped appearance.If the above hypothesis is true, the effect should become more pronounced with increased spike frequencies. Indeed, when the firing rate is analyzed as a function of current injection amplitude (4\u201340 pA; 1 s duration), the mean spike frequencies are significantly reduced in the presence of E-4031 at amplitudes \u22658 pA (Fig. 8,) ( = 11 of 15 VSNs). This effect of pharmacological ERG channel inhibition mimics the impaired AP firing phenotype observed in VSNs from stimulus-deprived animals (Fig. 8,, red) ( = 30). However, maintenance of a constant resting potential (supplemental Fig. 4, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) ( = 12) and spontaneous activity (supplemental Fig. 4, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) ( = 3) were essentially unaffected by ERG channel inhibition. We thus conclude that basal VSNs express K(ERG) to guarantee an appropriate input\u2013output relationship at intermediate to high levels of sensory stimulation.To substantiate this concept, we analyzed changes in the \u201canatomy\u201d of single spikes both during ERG channel inhibition (supplemental Fig. 5, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) and in stimulated compared with deprived mice (supplemental Fig. 5, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Single APs were elicited by repeated injection of suprathreshold current (10 pA; 45 ms; 50 cycles at 5 ms intervals). Supplemental Figure 5 (available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) shows representative examples of 50 normalized and averaged spikes of the same neuron in the absence (black trace) or presence (red trace) of E-4031, respectively. Here, spike width is increased from 5.05 ms (control) to 5.85 ms (E-4031). Eleven VSNs were examined for both half-width (supplemental Fig. 5, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) and maximal membrane repolarization (supplemental Fig. 5, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) during current injection. Because the same cells were also used for experiments shown in Figure 8,  and , we were able to categorize these VSNs as either drug sensitive ( = 7; red data points) or insensitive ( = 4; black data points). E-4031-sensitive neurons show a significant shift of the maximally repolarized membrane potential toward more depolarized values (control, \u221267.1 \u00b1 1.4 mV; E-4031, \u221258.8 \u00b1 1.3 mV;  = 0.008) and a significant increase in half-width (control, 4.8 \u00b1 0.18 ms; E-4031, 5.66 \u00b1 0.44 ms;  < 0.005)). A similar broadening of spike width during ERG channel inhibition has been shown for immature Purkinje neurons (from 5.1 to 6.3 ms) (Sacco et al., 2003). Again, when comparing single VSN spikes from stimulated ( = 13) versus deprived ( = 21) mice, the deprivation phenotype (supplemental Fig. 5, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) matches the effects of pharmacological treatment observed in control VSNs. Together, these data strongly suggest that vomeronasal ERG channels are important determinants of AP shape and VSN set-point excitability.Despite the critical role of the accessory olfactory system in regulation of social and reproductive behaviors, many physiological mechanisms underlying sensory signaling in VSNs remain unclear. Here, we show that basal vomeronasal neurons display a previously unrecognized form of homeostatic plasticity by regulating ERG K+ channel expression in an activity-dependent manner. These channels emerge as important determinants of VSN excitability and thus of sensory gain control in the accessory olfactory system.Neuronal ERG channel physiology is poorly understood (Sanguinetti and Tristani-Firouzi, 2006) and, so far, functional ERG channels have not been described in peripheral sensory neurons. Our results show that both ERG1 isoforms, ERG3 and the auxiliary \u03b2-subunit MiRP2, are coexpressed in basal VSNs. ERG3 and MiRP2 expression were primarily confined to VSN somata, whereas ERG1 staining was also found in the dendritic tips. Overlapping expression suggests that currents could be determined, at least in part, by heteromeric ERG channels (Wimmers et al., 2001), potentially forming complexes with pluripotent modulatory MiRP2 \u03b2-subunits (McCrossan et al., 2003). As shown by immunoblotting, both ERG1 isoforms are found in the VNO. The exclusive staining of basal VSNs suggests that both splice variants are coexpressed in a given cell and potentially coassemble in heteromeric complexes (Guasti et al., 2005). However, we can neither rule out selective isoform expression in subgroups of basal VSNs nor exclude segregated homomeric expression in individual neurons.To address the functional implications of vomeronasal ERG channel expression, targeted gene disruption represents one possible strategy. However, homozygous ERG1-deficient mice die early in development (Nerbonne et al., 2001; Salama and London, 2007). We therefore used a pharmacological approach. Given the severe pathophysiological phenotype of ERG channel gene mutations, the pharmacological profile of ERG channels has been intensely scrutinized (Sanguinetti and Tristani-Firouzi, 2006). In this study, we used E-4031 and the two unrelated peptide toxins ErgTx-1 and rBeKm-1 for pharmacological current dissection. Both E-4031 and ErgTx-1 are highly ERG specific, but not sufficiently subunit selective. In contrast, rBeKm-1, a closed channel blocker, discriminates between ERG1 (IC50, \u223c3 nm) and ERG3 (IC50, \u223c1 \u03bcm) (Korolkova et al., 2001). All inhibitors effectively isolated ERG-mediated currents from basal VSNs. For E-4031, ERG selectivity results from high-affinity binding to two inner pore aromatic residues that are substituted in other K+ channels. ErgTx-1 also interacts with the channel pore and, at the concentration used, does not affect other K+ channels including members of the closely related EAG family. E-4031 and ErgTx-1 did not display significant differences in inhibition potency, whereas rBeKm-1 (100 nm) isolated substantial, although significantly smaller, currents. These results suggest that a large fraction of vomeronasal ERG current depends on functional ERG1 channels, either as homomers or crucial subunits of heteromeric channels.In several kinetic aspects, vomeronasal ERG channels differ from heterologously expressed channels. Effective channel activation, even during 5 ms voltage steps, requires substantial depolarization (1/2: E-4031, \u221213.8 mV; ErgTx-1, \u22127.1 mV). Similar values were reported for recombinant ERG1 (Lees-Miller et al., 1997; Hirdes et al., 2004; Sturm et al., 2005), whereas more negative 1/2 potentials (approximately \u221250 mV) were described for ERG3 (Hirdes et al., 2005; Sturm et al., 2005). Vomeronasal ERG currents deactivated considerably faster than recombinant channels (Wimmers et al., 2002; Sturm et al., 2005). Accelerated deactivation, however, has also been observed for other endogenous mouse ERG currents (McKay and Huizinga, 2006; Yeung and Greenwood, 2007). In general, ERG1b and ERG3 deactivate much faster than ERG1a and ERG2 (Lees-Miller et al., 1997; Hirdes et al., 2005), and there are significant species variations in \u03c4deact (Tseng, 2001). Assuming that VSN subunits form heteromeric channels, activation and deactivation will be dominated by the faster subunit(s) (Wimmers et al., 2001, 2002). In principle, differences between vomeronasal and recombinant channels could also result from processes such as phosphorylation, Ca2+-dependent channel modulation, or lipid interaction. Given the regulated coexpression of MiRP2, however, it is tempting to speculate that this pluripotent modulator of K+ channels coassembles with vomeronasal ERG channels, thus altering their gating. Together, the observed channel properties are well suited to shape vomeronasal AP discharge. VSN spikes display large overshoot and last considerably longer than typical central neuron APs (Sacco et al., 2003; Ukhanov et al., 2007), providing the depolarization level and time course required for channel activation. In contrast, fast deactivation and negligible steady-state \u201cwindow\u201d current at rest argue against a role in VSN resting potential maintenance.Pheromonal information translates into specific discharge patterns. The VSN output parameter space is multidimensional [i.e., information can be encoded by discharge duration (temporal coding), frequency (rate coding), or both]. These parameters are dictated by the AP duration, shape, and associated refractory period and are thus set by the individual currents contributing to an AP. We dissected this \u201cinternal anatomy\u201d (Bean, 2007) of basal VSN spikes using the AP clamp technique and isolated ERG currents maximally activated during the late phase of repolarization. This current deactivated with an average time constant close to the \u03c4deact value observed after step repolarization to \u221260 mV. Amplitudes varied as a function of the interspike interval at frequencies \u22657 Hz, showing larger currents at shorter interspike episodes. Theoretically, this could reflect channel desensitization during the initial phase (\u223c1 s) of spiking. However, when prerecorded APs with smaller, although increasing, intervals (55\u2013135 ms) were applied as the command voltage, amplitudes decreased with prolonged intervals throughout the recording (data not shown). We therefore conclude that, at high-frequency discharge, incomplete interspike deactivation can lead to current accumulation [similar to observations reported by Chiesa et al. (1997) and Sacco et al. (2003)]. Recently, accumulation of recombinant ERG1 and ERG3 currents was shown already during short simulated AP bursts (6 ms duration, 20 ms intervals) (Sturm et al., 2005). Basal VSNs display frequency saturation at \u223c25 Hz. Thus, minimum intervals of \u223c40 ms and fast deactivation set a limit for maximum current accumulation.How important are ERG currents for a stable input\u2013output relationship? VSNs are remarkably sensitive to current injection, with a few picoamperes leading to repetitive firing (Liman and Corey, 1996). Yet, pheromonal stimulation can induce receptor currents of up to tens of picoamperes (this study; Inamura and Kashiwayanagi, 2000). In addition, the constricted space of the VNO lumen and putatively slow stimulus exchange likely result in a prolonged presence of pheromonal cues. Therefore, VSNs need to faithfully integrate prolonged sensory input of variable magnitude. When basal VSNs were stimulated by injection profiles that mimic endogenous receptor currents, AP output changed dramatically after ERG channel inhibition. During high-amplitude current injection, VSNs frequently ceased firing after one or a few spikes. More importantly, such impaired AP discharge was similarly observed in VSNs of stimulus-deprived animals. Constant current injections confirmed that ERG currents provide a critical repolarizing conductance at intermediate to high stimulation levels. We thus conclude that, by ensuring repolarization sufficient to relieve Na+ channels from inactivation, ERG currents extend the dynamic response range of basal VSNs.Neurons display compensatory feedback mechanisms that reestablish a set-point functionality in response to altered sensory input. Output stability within optimal firing rate limits is achieved by modulating ion channel density, distribution, or function. Thus,  channel synthesis is frequently regulated to gradually restore firing properties on a longer time scale. Experimentally, compensatory feedback is frequently induced by chronic activity deprivation over a longer time scale (i.e., hours to days) (Davis, 2006). This concept provided the temporal framework for investigating the consequences of stimulus deprivation in the mouse VNO.How can sensory input trigger changes in gene transcription? Current models propose a key role of intracellular Ca2+, a signal well correlated with neuronal activity (Turrigiano, 1999). In VSN somata, responses to pheromonal stimuli induce robust Ca2+ transients (Spehr et al., 2002; Chamero et al., 2007). Ca2+ accumulation during periods of high sensory activity or the lack of such signals during stimulus deprivation could readily control ion channel gene transcription.In the present study, we focused on activity-dependent changes in K+ channel expression because K+ conductance changes have frequently been implicated in homeostatic compensation (Davis, 2006). Initially, we performed microarray analyses to achieve a genetic high-throughput. Compared with data obtained (e.g., in cancer expression profiling), we observed relatively low changes. In brain tissue microarray experiments, however, similarly low changes even for strongly regulated genes are rather the rule than the exception (Mirnics, 2001). Regulated expression is especially difficult to discern if only subpopulations of cells express the target gene (Mirnics and Pevsner, 2004). The small, although highly significant, changes we detected are therefore not surprising. Our conservative approach to data analysis (see Materials and Methods) might, however, mask further \u201cbiologically true\u201d expression changes.Because there is no simple quantitative correlation between gene transcription and protein translation (e.g., compare ERG2 microarray and RT-PCR data with immunochemistry results), microarray findings have to be confirmed on the protein level. Although a positive correlation between mRNA and protein levels is frequently observed, several studies have shown no or even a negative correlation, resulting from different mechanisms and pathways (with separate time constants) that independently govern transcription and translation (Lewandowski and Small, 2005). We therefore examined changes in ERG1a, ERG1b, and MiRP2 expression by immunoblotting. Our results provide evidence for an effective upregulation of both ERG1 isoforms and downregulation of MiRP2 in basal VSNs. However, given that stimulation was based on chemically complex sources of social cues (both volatile and nonvolatile), it appears likely that further expression changes, beyond the scope of this study, could have occurred in both basal and apical neurons.A key issue in interpreting our data are to resolve whether regulated gene expression is reflected in VSN physiology. We find significantly reduced ERG currents in VSNs from stimulus-deprived mice, accompanied by defects in adequate AP output in response to medium-to-high stimulation levels. Together, the combination of microarray profiling, immunoblotting, and patch-clamp recordings supports the concept that, by increasing  expression (and potentially  downregulation) during periods of increased pheromonal stimulation, basal VSNs extend their dynamic firing range to (re)establish a meaningful sensory output.M.S. was supported by grants from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (SP724/2-1, Emmy Noether Program) and the Mercator Foundation.

Activity-dependent modification of synaptic transmission onto principal neurons is well studied, but little is known about the modulation of inhibitory transmission between interneurons. However, synaptic plasticity at this level has clear implications for the generation of synchronized activity. We investigated the molecular mechanism(s) and functional consequences of an activity-induced lasting increase in GABA release that occurs between inhibitory interneurons (stellate cells) in the cerebellum. Using whole-cell recording and cerebellar slices, we found that stimulation of glutamatergic inputs (parallel fibers) with a physiological-like pattern of activity triggered a lasting increase in GABA release from stellate cells. This activity also potentiated inhibitory transmission between synaptically connected interneurons. Extracellular recording revealed that the enhanced inhibitory transmission reduced the firing frequency and altered the pattern of action potential activity in stellate cells. The induction of the sustained increase in GABA release required activation of NMDA receptors. Using pharmacological and genetic approaches, we found that presynaptic cAMP/PKA (protein kinase A) signaling and RIM1\u03b1, an active zone protein, is the critical pathway that is required for the lasting enhancement of GABA release. Thus, a common mechanism can underlie presynaptic plasticity of both excitatory and inhibitory transmission. This activity-dependent regulation of synaptic transmission between inhibitory interneurons may serve as an important mechanism for interneuronal network plasticity.Glutamate has emerged as a major regulator of inhibitory synaptic transmission. Through the activation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs), glutamate paradoxically enhances GABA release from inhibitory neurons in several brain regions (Gaiarsa et al., 2002; Liu and Lachamp, 2006; Nugent et al., 2007), producing a long-lasting change in inhibitory synaptic transmission. Inhibitory neurons innervate principal neurons and connect to other interneurons to form inhibitory networks. Thus, a sustained increase in GABA release can suppress the activity of principal neurons and modulate the activity of inhibitory networks, leading to global changes in the activity of neuronal circuits.NMDARs are present in the presynaptic terminals of GABAergic neurons (Paquet and Smith, 2000; Duguid and Smart, 2004; Fiszman et al., 2005). Recent studies reveal that activation of presynaptic NMDARs can induce lasting changes in GABA release from inhibitory neurons in the visual system (Lien et al., 2006). In the cerebellum, stimulation of glutamatergic parallel fiber (PF) inputs triggers a sustained enhancement of GABA release from stellate cells [inhibitory long-term potentiation (I-LTP)]. This effect requires the activation of presynaptic NMDARs (Liu and Lachamp, 2006).Cerebellar stellate cells are connected to each other via GABAergic synapses. They form inhibitory networks and fire action potentials synchronously (Mann-Metzer and Yarom, 1999). Because action potential frequency and pattern in stellate cells are strongly influenced by inhibitory inputs (H\u00e4usser and Clark, 1997), a lasting enhancement of GABA release from stellate cells may have a profound impact on the synchronized activity of inhibitory networks within the cerebellum.Given the importance of glutamatergic modulation of GABA release, it is critical to understand the molecular events that link NMDAR activation to enhanced GABA release. The induction of I-LTP requires calcium entry through presynaptic NMDARs (Liu and Lachamp, 2006). This can lead to an increase in the production of cAMP via Ca2+-stimulated adenylyl cyclase and thus protein kinase A (PKA) activation (Storm et al., 1998). PKA phosphorylates a presynaptic active zone protein, RIM1\u03b1, and promotes a sustained increase in glutamate release (Lonart et al., 2003). RIM1\u03b1 is also required for presynaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) at excitatory synapses (Castillo et al., 2002). Deletion of RIM1\u03b1 enhances presynaptic long-term depression (LTD) at the mossy fiber glutamatergic synapse, but abolishes presynaptic LTD of inhibitory transmission (Chevaleyre et al., 2007). However, whether PKA and RIM1\u03b1 are involved in I-LTP is unknown.Here, we demonstrate that a physiologically relevant stimulation of glutamatergic inputs evokes a lasting increase in GABA release at inhibitory synapses between stellate cells. One functional consequence of this effect is a marked alteration in the firing pattern in stellate cells. We find that NMDAR activation enhances GABA release via a presynaptic cAMP/PKA signaling pathway, and deletion of RIM1\u03b1 abolishes I-LTP. Thus, the cAMP/PKA/RIM1\u03b1 signaling pathway is a general mechanism that underlies the long-term modulation of transmitter release at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Because strong inhibitory transmission between GABAergic neurons is needed for the generation of synchronized network oscillations (Bartos et al., 2007; Middleton et al., 2008), an implication of our findings is that glutamate can regulate the activity of an interneuron network via an enhancement of GABA release.Saggital and horizontal cerebellar slices (250\u2013350 \u03bcm) from postnatal day 18 (P18) to P23 C57BL/6J, RIM1\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 or wild-type mice were obtained as previously described (Liu and Cull-Candy, 2000; Liu and Cull-Candy, 2005). Briefly, mice were decapitated and the cerebellum was quickly removed. Slices were cut with a Leica VT1000S vibrating microslicer in an ice-cold artificial CSF (ACSF) containing the following (in mm): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 7 MgCl2, 26 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 25 glucose, and 1 kynurenic acid. Slices were then allowed to recover for 1 h in a similar saline containing 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2 in the absence of kynurenic acid at room temperature and bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2.Whole-cell voltage and current-clamp recordings were made with Multiclamp 700A and Axopatch 200B amplifiers (Molecular Devices). The extracellular solution (in mm: 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, and 25 glucose, pH 7.4) was continuously bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Electrode resistance was 6\u20138 M\u03a9. Inhibitory synaptic currents were filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz. Stellate cells were identified by their location in the outer two-thirds of the molecular layer and by their ability to fire spontaneous action potentials in the cell-attached configuration. All recordings were performed at 32\u201336\u00b0C, unless otherwise noted.Currents were evoked with a glass monopolar stimulating electrode placed at least 80 \u03bcm from the recording pipette to avoid direct stimulation of the postsynaptic neuron. Depolarizing pulses were delivered with a Digitimer DS2A Mk. II stimulator (Digitimer) at 0.3 Hz. The strength and duration of the stimulating pulses were adjusted to obtain monosynaptic responses. Typical stimulation strength and duration were 2\u201310 V and 120\u2013200 \u03bcs, respectively. Electrodes were filled with a pipette solution (in mm: 120 Cs-acetate, 2.9 MgCl2, 0.1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, 4 Na-ATP, and 0.4 Na-GTP, pH 7.3), which set the reversal potential for Cl\u2212 to \u221281 mV. Evoked IPSCs (eIPSCs) were recorded at \u221230 mV and visualized as outward currents. Evoked EPSCs (eEPSCs) were recorded at \u221260 mV and visualized as inward currents. In some experiments, NMDAR-mediated currents were evoked by a train of PF stimulation (four stimuli at 100 Hz) and recorded at +40 mV in the presence of glycine (20 \u03bcm), GABAA receptor blockers, picrotoxin (PTX) (50 \u03bcm) or 6-imino-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1(6)-pyridazinebutanoic acid hydrobromide (SR95531) (20 \u03bcm), an AMPA receptor (AMPAR) blocker, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6-nitro-2,3-dioxo-benzo[]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX) (5 \u03bcm), and a glycine receptor blocker, strychnine (1 \u03bcm). Series resistance was monitored throughout the experiment, which was terminated if that parameter changed by >20%.Neurons were voltage clamped at \u221230 mV. Synaptic currents were recorded in the presence of TTX (0.5 \u03bcm) using the Cs-based internal solution described above. TTX was washed out for 20 min before I-LTP induction by parallel fiber stimulation. A K-based pipette solution (in mm: 135 KCl, 4.6 MgCl2, 0.1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, 4 Na-ATP, and 0.4 Na-GTP, pH 7.4) was used in a few experiments conducted at room temperature (21\u201323\u00b0C). In these experiments, neurons were clamped at \u221270 mV and miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) were seen as inward currents.Action potentials were recorded in whole-cell current-clamp mode and were evoked by means of a ramp depolarization (rise time of 0.25 ms and falling phase of 100 ms), to mimic NMDAR-mediated synaptic currents. These experiments were performed in an extracellular solution (ACSF) containing 1 mm kynurenic acid and 100 \u03bcm PTX. To determine the frequency and pattern of action potential firing in stellate cells, action potentials were recorded extracellularly using the cell-attached configuration. The loose patch resistance was <100 M\u03a9 and recordings were made using the slow current-clamp mode of the amplifier.I-LTP was induced by parallel fiber stimulation that mimicked physiological stimulation or by a brief application of NMDA and glycine (chemical induction).A parallel bipolar electrode (150 \u03bcm spacing) was placed across the molecular layer \u223c200 \u03bcm from the recording electrode and was used to stimulate PFs. The stimulus intensity ranged from 5 to 50 V with a duration of 0.2 ms. The stimulation protocol consisted of a train of four pulses at 100 Hz, which was repeated 5 or 15 times at 1 Hz. The cell was voltage clamped at \u221260 mV during stimulation.ACSF that contained 15\u201330 \u03bcm NMDA and 20 \u03bcm glycine was superfused for 5 min at room temperature or for 30 s at 32\u201336\u00b0C. During NMDA/glycine application, the postsynaptic cell was voltage clamped at \u221260 mV. NBQX (5 \u03bcm) and strychnine (1 \u03bcm) were present throughout the experiment. The experiments in which mIPSCs were monitored before and after application of NMDA/glycine were performed at room temperature. Experiments in which NMDA/glycine application was used to induce I-LTP of evoked IPSCs were conducted at 32\u201336\u00b0C.Average eIPSCs or eEPSCs were constructed from at least 50 sweeps. Each mean paired-pulse response was obtained from at least 50\u201370 events. Events with a nontypical shape and latency were rejected (these are likely to be spontaneous IPSCs). The paired-pulse ratio (PPR) was calculated as the amplitude ratio of the average eIPSC2 to average eIPSC1. The coefficient of variation (CV) of synaptic currents was calculated from the peak amplitude of at least 70 events. Miniature IPSCs were identified using the template detection feature of Clampfit (version 9.2). A template was constructed from \u223c500 mIPSCs that were manually selected from a typical recording. The template accuracy was checked using the manual event selection mode. The detection threshold was adjusted such that both false-positive and false-negative events detected by the template represented \u223c5% of the total number of mIPSCs (false positive, 5.5 \u00b1 1.1%; false negative, 4.6 \u00b1 0.5%;  = 5). Significant difference was assessed using a two-tailed Student's  test. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM.RIM1\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice were generated from mating heterozygous male and female mice and identified by genotyping tail DNA, as described previously (Schoch et al., 2002). Briefly, tail clips were taken from P15 mice and digested overnight at 37\u00b0C in 400 \u03bcl of SNET buffer containing the following: 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 5 mm Na2EDTA, 400 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, and proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml). For genotyping, we used the following primers: wild type, CAACTGTGGCTGTGCACACTTGCCG and CGTGCATACTCCACTGATCTCTCCC, product size, 0.26 kb; RIM1\u03b1 mutant, CAACTGTGGCTGTGCACACTTGCCG and GAGCGCGCGCGGCGGAGTTGTTGAC, product size, 0.30 kb. These were run as separate reactions. The PCR products were visualized on a 1.75% agarose gel.PTX, TTX, kynurenic acid, d(\u2212)-3-(2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP), 7-chloro-kynurenic acid, \u03b1-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG), (\u00b1)-1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol hydrochloride (ICI 118,551), (9,10,12)-2,3,9,10,11,12-hexahydro-10-hydroxy-9-methyl-1-oxo-9,12-epoxy-1-diindolo[1,2,3-fg:3\u2032,2\u2032,1\u2032-kl]pyrrolo[3,4-i][1,6]benzodiazocine-10-carboxylic acid, hexyl ester (KT5720), forskolin were obtained from Tocris Bioscience; SR95531, NBQX, -(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (AM-251) and NMDA were from Ascent; strychnine was from Sigma-Aldrich; -[2-(-bromocinnamyl-amino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide dihydrochloride (H89) and 1,9-dideoxyforskolin were from BIOMOL; glycine was from Calbiochem; -nitro-l-arginine (l-NNA) was from Cayman Chemical; and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine-3\u2032,5\u2032-cyclic monophosphorothioate, Sp-isomer (Sp-8-CPT-cAMPS) was from BioLog Life Science Institute.Sensory stimulation triggers a burst of action potentials in granule cells at \u223c80 Hz (Chadderton et al., 2004). Because the axons of glutamatergic granule cells (PFs) innervate stellate cells in the molecular layer, we tested whether a brief burst of PF stimulation could effectively induce a long-lasting change in inhibitory transmission. Because cerebellar stellate cells receive inhibitory inputs from other stellate cells, we monitored spontaneous GABA release by recording mIPSCs in stellate cells that were voltage clamped at \u221230 mV (Fig. 1). PF stimulation using 15 trains (at 1 Hz) of four depolarizations (at 100 Hz) reliably triggered a long-lasting increase in the mIPSC frequency (Fig. 1,) (73 \u00b1 11%;  = 7;  < 0.05) in the absence of any change in the mIPSC amplitude (\u22128.9 \u00b1 3.3%;  = 7). This result indicates that a sustained enhancement in spontaneous GABA release from stellate cells (I-LTP) had occurred after PF stimulation. Reducing the PF stimulation to five bursts also triggered a potentiation in mIPSC frequency in four of five cells (Fig. 1,), and the average mIPSC frequency increased by 55 \u00b1 22% ( = 5;  < 0.04). Thus, a physiologically relevant PF stimulation is sufficient to induce a lasting increase in GABA release from stellate cells. In subsequent experiments, we used the 15 train protocol to reliably induce I-LTP.Physiologically relevant burst stimulation of parallel fibers induces a lasting increase in spontaneous GABA release from stellate cells. , Schematic of the experimental protocol (top) and mIPSC frequency time course before and after stimulation recorded in a postsynaptic stellate cell (bottom). , mIPSCs in a stellate cell before and after PF stimulation.

Error bars indicate SEM.Cerebellar stellate cells form inhibitory synapses onto each other (Palay and Chan-Palay, 1974; Llano and Gerschenfeld, 1993; Kondo and Marty, 1998) and transmission between synaptically connected stellate cells may influence the activity of inhibitory interneuron network. Our recent study showed that burst stimulation of PF inputs can increase GABA release at the autaptic stellate cell synapse (Liu and Lachamp, 2006). To test whether glutamate release from PFs also modulates inhibitory transmission at the nonautaptic inhibitory synapse, we examined inhibitory synaptic transmission between two stellate cells.We evoked inhibitory synaptic currents by placing a stimulating electrode \u223c80 \u03bcm from the recorded stellate cell (Fig. 2). Increasing the stimulation strength did not further increase the amplitude of evoked IPSCs (Fig. 2), indicating that the postsynaptic cell received an input from a single presynaptic cell. The synaptic current was blocked by 20 \u03bcm SR95531 (Fig. 2) and is thus mediated by GABAA receptors.Evoked GABA release at the stellate-to-stellate cell synapse is enhanced by PF stimulation. , Schematic of the experimental protocol. , Evoked currents arose from the input of a single presynaptic GABAergic neuron.

After 15 min of stable recording, kynurenic acid was washed out, and during this time we stimulated PFs. After stimulation (and after the reintroduction of kynurenic acid), the amplitude of the evoked IPSCs increased by 116 \u00b1 42% ( = 5;  < 0.05), an effect that lasted for at least 30 min (Fig. 2). The potentiation was prevented by the presence of NMDA receptor blockers, CPP (10 \u03bcm) and 7-chloro-kynurenic acid (20 \u03bcm), during the PF stimulation (Fig. 2). Furthermore a brief application of 15\u201330 \u03bcm NMDA and 20 \u03bcm glycine also induced a lasting increase in eIPSC amplitude (117 \u00b1 10%;  = 5;  < 0.05) (Fig. 2). Thus, NMDA receptor activation produced a sustained potentiation of evoked IPSC amplitude.To determine whether the potentiation was attributable to an increase in GABA release from stellate cells, we measured the paired-pulse ratio, the coefficient of variation, and the failure rate of evoked IPSCs. Inhibitory synaptic currents were evoked by two consecutive presynaptic stimuli separated by a 20 ms interval. Activation of NMDA receptors reduced the paired-pulse ratio (Fig. 2,,) (PPR = 2/1; from 0.84 \u00b1 0.06 to 0.59 \u00b1 0.06;  = 4;  < 0.005) and the failure rate (Fig. 2,,) (before stimulation, 0.17 \u00b1 0.06; after stimulation, 0.04 \u00b1 0.01;  = 5;  < 0.05), indicating an increase in GABA release. Consistent with a presynaptic mechanism, 1/CV2 (Faber and Korn, 1991) also increased after PF stimulation (Fig. 2) (from 6.0 \u00b1 2.4 to 10.4 \u00b1 3.7;  = 5;  < 0.05). Furthermore, CPP prevented the PF stimulation-induced changes in PPR and 1/CV2 (before stimulation: PPR, 0.57 \u00b1 0.12; 1/CV2, 5.4 \u00b1 1.6; after stimulation: PPR, 0.60 \u00b1 0.09; 1/CV2, 5.9 \u00b1 2.8;  = 3), suggesting that NMDAR activation induced a lasting increase in GABA release from stellate cells. PF stimulation also triggered a sustained increase in the frequency of miniature IPSCs in stellate cells (Fig. 1). These results indicate that the lasting enhancement in inhibitory transmission between two stellate cells is expressed presynaptically and arises as a consequence of an increase in the presynaptic release of GABA. To test whether asynchronous release at the stellate cell-to-stellate cell synapse was also altered, we measured the spontaneous IPSC frequency before and after the evoked IPSCs. PF stimulation did not alter the IPSC frequency or amplitude [control ratio of IPSC frequency, 0.93 \u00b1 0.13; after PF stimulation, 0.82 \u00b1 0.16 ( = 4; events measured 20\u2013120 ms after the second evoked IPSC relative to that before the first evoked IPSC)].Although stellate cells spontaneously fire action potentials in the absence of synaptic input, the firing pattern is usually controlled by a tonic inhibitory input (H\u00e4usser and Clark, 1997). We can therefore predict that an enhancement of GABA release from stellate cells would reduce the firing frequency and alter the firing pattern of synaptically connected stellate cells.To determine the impact of the PF-mediated enhancement of GABA release, we recorded the activity of stellate cells at 35\u00b0C using an extracellular electrode. After obtaining a stable recording, PFs were stimulated using the I-LTP induction protocol. Action potentials were then subsequently recorded for at least 30 min.Before PF stimulation, stellate cells spontaneously fired action potentials at 8.5 \u00b1 2.7 Hz ( = 6). The spiking activity was irregular (Fig. 3), as shown by the variable interspike interval (ISI), which had a coefficient of variation of 0.54 \u00b1 0.07 ( = 6). This was also evident from the lack of multiple peaks in the autocorrelogram (Fig. 3). The irregular action potential firing pattern arose from tonic inhibition because blockade of GABAA receptors by SR95531 increased the firing rate by 68.5 \u00b1 16.9% ( = 6;  < 0.02) and reduced the CV of the ISI from 0.54 \u00b1 0.07 to 0.36 \u00b1 0.08 ( = 6;  < 0.002), consistent with previous observations (H\u00e4usser and Clark, 1997). In the presence of SR95531, the autocorrelogram exhibited multiple peaks indicating a highly regular firing pattern (Fig. 3,).Parallel fiber stimulation alters interneuron action potential firing. , Example of action potentials recorded extracellularly from a stellate cell in control (), 15 min after PF stimulation (), and 30 min after stimulation in the presence of 20 \u03bcm SR955321 ().

Firing frequencies were calculated during a 5 min window. , The CV of the ISI increased after PF stimulation as the firing pattern became more irregular. The open circles represent cells recorded in the presence of 5 mm kynurenic acid ( = 5), and the open triangles represent cells recorded without kynurenic acid ( = 4). The bars represent the average CV value before and after stimulation. Error bars indicate SEM. * < 0.05. , Example of the cumulative distribution of the ISI of APs recorded when 5 mm kynurenic acid was included (a different cell from the one shown in ). Shown are before (black line), after PF stimulation (gray line), and in the presence of a GABAAR blocker (dotted line).After PF stimulation, the spontaneous action potential firing frequency decreased by 60 \u00b1 7%, from 26.3 \u00b1 8.3 to 10.9 \u00b1 5.1 Hz ( = 4;  < 0.05). This suppression lasted for at least 30\u201340 min (Fig. 3). At the same time, the action potential firing became highly irregular (Fig. 3,) as indicated by the increase in the CV (Fig. 3) from 0.48 \u00b1 0.05 to 1.17 \u00b1 0.13 ( = 4;  < 0.05) and the appearance of a single small peak in the autocorrelogram (Fig. 3). To confirm that these changes were indeed associated with increased inhibitory transmission, SR95531 was applied to block GABAA receptors at the end of the recording (Fig. 3,). SR95531 completely reversed the PF stimulation-induced change in action potential firing. The firing frequency increased to the control level or above (Fig. 3,). The firing pattern now showed a striking regularity (Fig. 3) and large, multiple peaks in the autocorrelogram (Fig. 3). These results strongly suggest that an increase in inhibitory transmission gives rise to a change in the frequency and pattern of action potential firing in stellate cells.Theoretically, an enhanced inhibitory transmission could result from a direct increase in GABA release, or indirectly from a potentiation of excitatory transmission at the PF-to-stellate cell synapse (Rancillac and Cr\u00e9pel, 2004). To determine the contribution of enhanced GABA release, we blocked excitatory synaptic currents during action potential recordings with 5 mm kynurenic acid to eliminate disynaptic inhibition. Kynurenic acid was washed out during PF stimulation and reintroduced after stimulation. PF stimulation reduced the action potential firing rate (before stimulation, 8.3 \u00b1 1.4 Hz; after stimulation, 5 \u00b1 1 Hz;  = 5;  < 0.02) and prolonged the ISI. This was seen as a rightward shift in the cumulative probability distribution of the ISI (Fig. 3). After stimulation, AP firing became markedly irregular, as indicated by an increase in the CV of the ISI (Fig. 3) (before stimulation, 0.53 \u00b1 0.3; after stimulation, 1.1 \u00b1 0.3;  = 5;  < 0.05). This result indicates that an enhancement of GABA release from stellate cells significantly contributed to the change in action potential firing rate and pattern. Thus I-LTP can regulate interneuron spiking activity.We next investigated the molecular events that link the release of glutamate from PFs to an increase in GABA release from stellate cells. NMDA receptor blockers, CPP (10 \u03bcm) and 7-chloro-kynurenic acid (20 \u03bcm), both blocked the PF stimulation-induced lasting increase in mIPSC frequency (Fig. 4) (\u221211 \u00b1 3%;  = 3) and prevented the potentiation of evoked IPSC amplitude (Fig. 2). Thus activation of NMDARs is required for the induction of I-LTP.The induction of I-LTP requires activation of NMDA receptors, but not group I and II mGluRs, NO synthase, CB1Rs, or \u03b2-adrenergic receptors. , Application of 10 \u03bcm CPP, an NMDA receptor blocker, during PF stimulation prevented I-LTP (). , The addition of 30\u2013100 \u03bcm l-NNA, an NO synthase inhibitor (); 20 \u03bcm AM-251, a CB1R antagonist (); 0.2 and 1 mm MCPG, a mGluR blocker (); or 10 \u03bcm ICI 118,551, a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blocker (), did not block I-LTP. , Summary data. Error bars indicate SEM. * < 0.05.Our previous study showed that Ca2+ influx is necessary to induce the lasting increase in mIPSC frequency (Liu and Lachamp, 2006). Inclusion of 10\u201320 mm BAPTA in the patch electrode has been shown to inhibit the AMPAR subtype switch in stellate cells that is induced by activation of NMDA and AMPA receptors (Liu and Cull-Candy, 2000; Sun and Liu, 2007). However intracellular application BAPTA failed to prevent I-LTP in stellate cells (Liu and Lachamp, 2006). Thus, a Ca2+ rise in the postsynaptic stellate cell is not required. This suggests that glutamate spillover activates NMDARs on the presynaptic neurons, most likely the presynaptic terminals of stellate cells (Duguid and Smart, 2004; Fiszman et al., 2005). However, activation of NMDARs/metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) or postsynaptic membrane depolarization can trigger the release of retrograde signals such as NO and endocanabinoids from stellate cells (Shin and Linden, 2005; Beierlein and Regehr, 2006) and Purkinje cells (Yoshida et al., 2002; Brown et al., 2003; Qiu and Kn\u00f6pfel, 2007). We therefore tested for the possible involvement of these messengers in the induction of I-LTP.As shown in Figure 4,  and , in the presence of 30\u2013100 \u03bcm l-NNA, a potent inhibitor of NO synthase, PF stimulation still induced an increase in mIPSC frequency (49 \u00b1 11%;  = 5;  < 0.03). Inclusion of AM-251 (20 \u03bcm), a CB1R antagonist, during the PF stimulation also failed to prevent the I-LTP induction (Fig. 4) because the mIPSC frequency increased by 79 \u00b1 26% ( = 4;  < 0.05). Finally, MCPG (200 \u03bcm and 1 mm), a group I and II mGluR blocker, did not prevent the PF-induced increase in mIPSC frequency (Fig. 4) (54.4 \u00b1 13.7%;  = 4;  < 0.03). This suggests that induction of I-LTP does not require the involvement of NO or endocanabinoids and that group I and II mGluRs are unlikely to be involved. Because the activation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors on interneurons can lead to an increase in GABA release onto Purkinje cells (Saitow et al., 2005), we tested for the possible involvement of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors in the I-LTP. ICI 118,551, a specific blocker of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors, did not prevent the PF stimulation-induced increase in mIPSC frequency (Fig. 4) (73 \u00b1 10.7%;  = 4;  < 0.05). Thus, PF stimulation-induced I-LTP is not mediated by \u03b2-adrenergic receptors.Therefore, the induction of an increase in the GABA release from stellate cells requires activation of NMDA receptors, but does not depend on \u03b2-adrenergic receptor activation, endocanabinoids, or NO.To determine the downstream signaling pathways after NMDA receptor activation, we first tested whether PKA activity regulated GABA release from cerebellar stellate cells. Application of 10 \u03bcm H89, a PKA inhibitor, reduced the frequency of mIPSCs in stellate cells, whereas the mIPSC amplitude remained unchanged (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). This indicates that PKA activity regulates GABA release under basal conditions.To determine whether PKA activation is required for I-LTP, we used two PKA inhibitors, KT5720 and H89. Cerebellar slices were preincubated with 5 \u03bcm KT5720 for 2 h, and 1 \u03bcm KT5720 was present during the recording. Under these conditions, NMDA and glycine application failed to trigger a sustained increase in the amplitude of evoked IPSCs (Fig. 5). PF stimulation also no longer induced a lasting enhancement in the frequency of mIPSCs (Fig. 5,) ( = 5; frequency, \u22124.9 \u00b1 11.6%; amplitude, \u22122.8 \u00b1 13.4%). Thus, inhibition of PKA prevented the PF stimulation-induced I-LTP. This was confirmed using another PKA inhibitor, H89 (10 \u03bcm), which also blocked the I-LTP ( = 5; frequency, \u22126.8 \u00b1 5.5%; amplitude, \u22126.2 \u00b1 8%) (Fig. 5; supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). These results indicate that lasting enhancement of both spontaneous and evoked GABA release from stellate cells requires PKA activation. When the recording pipette was loaded with KT5720 (20 \u03bcm) to selectively inhibit postsynaptic PKA, PF stimulation still enhanced the mIPSC frequency by 92.4 \u00b1 23.3% (Fig. 5,) ( = 5;  < 0.04). Thus, I-LTP requires PKA activation, but does not involve PKA activity in the postsynaptic neuron.Inhibition of PKA by KT5720 blocks I-LTP. , , Cerebellar slices were incubated with 5 \u03bcm KT5720, a PKA inhibitor, for 2 h. Under these conditions, parallel fiber stimulation failed to induce a lasting increase in the amplitude of eIPSCs () ( = 3) and in the frequency of mIPSCs () ( = 5). , Inclusion of 20 \u03bcm KT5720 in the pipette solution to selectively block PKA in the postsynaptic neuron did not inhibit I-LTP ( = 5). , Inhibition of PKA prevented the I-LTP induced by NMDA and glycine application ( = 3; filled circles). The open triangles (control) are data from previous experiments reported by Liu and Lachamp (2006). , The extracellular Ca2+ concentration was increased to 5 mm during NMDA and glycine application. Under these conditions, KT5720 prevented NMDAR-induced I-LTP ( = 6). , Summary data (PF stimulation: H89 bath,  = 5; control,  = 7; NMDA/glycine application: H89,  = 5). Error bars indicate SEM.How does PKA activity regulate I-LTP? Because I-LTP induction requires both glutamate spillover and NMDA receptor activation (Liu and Lachamp, 2006), we examined the possibility that the PKA inhibition suppressed glutamate release from PFs, so reducing the activation of NMDARs. First, we tested the effect of H89 (10 \u03bcm) on PF-evoked NMDAR-mediated currents. Slices were preincubated with H89 for 2 h before recording. A burst of PF stimulation evoked an NMDAR-mediated current in both control and H89-treated slices (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) (NMDAR-mediated current charge in control, 55.9 \u00b1 13.7 nA \u00b7 s; in H89-treated cells, 38.5 \u00b1 6.7 nA \u00b7 s;  = 5;  > 0.05). Thus, PKA inhibition did not significantly alter the current evoked by activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs. Second, if PKA inhibition blocked I-LTP by reducing glutamate release, direct activation of NMDARs by bath application of NMDA and glycine would be expected to induce I-LTP in the presence of a PKA inhibitor. After a 2 h incubation with 5 \u03bcm KT5720, coapplication of NMDA and glycine did not trigger a long-lasting increase in the mIPSC frequency (6.6 \u00b1 7.6%;  = 3). Instead, a transient increase in mIPSC frequency was observed in several cells during and immediately after the application of NMDA and glycine (Fig. 5) as described in previous studies (Glitsch and Marty, 1999; Duguid and Smart, 2004; Liu and Lachamp, 2006). Thus, a reduction in glutamate release from PFs is unlikely to contribute to the blockade of I-LTP by PKA inhibitors.PKA inhibition has been shown to reduce the Ca2+ permeability of NMDARs (Skeberdis et al., 2006). Because Ca2+ influx via these receptors is necessary to induce I-LTP (Liu and Lachamp, 2006), we increased the extracellular Ca2+ concentration to 5 mm to enhance Ca2+ influx and compensate for a possible inhibition of the NMDAR Ca2+ permeability by PKA inhibitors. In stellate cells pretreated with KT5720 or H89, NMDA/glycine application in a high Ca2+ ACSF transiently enhanced mIPSC frequency, but failed to induce a lasting increase in GABA release (Fig. 5,) (KT5720, 10.6 \u00b1 1.3%;  = 6) (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) (H89, 2.4 \u00b1 11.1%;  = 5). Control cells from slices incubated in 0.02% DMSO (the solvent for PKA blockers) exhibited a normal I-LTP (125.4 \u00b1 80.3%;  = 3;  < 0.05). These results suggest that a reduction in Ca2+ entry through NMDARs was not responsible for preventing the I-LTP.To confirm that an increase in the cAMP level in the presynaptic terminals is required, we used a cAMP analog, Sp-8-CPT-cAMPS, and forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase, to raise the cAMP level and enhance PKA activity, because we predicted that this should occlude any additional increase in GABA release triggered by PF stimulation. After treatment with 100 \u03bcm Sp-8-CPT-cAMPS, parallel fiber stimulation failed to induce I-LTP in the presence of Sp-8-CPT-cAMPS (Fig. 6,). Incubation with 50 \u03bcm forskolin also prevented I-LTP (Fig. 6,). Thus, an increase in cAMP production is required to trigger I-LTP.Increasing cAMP levels prevents I-LTP. , Cerebellar slices were incubated with 100 \u03bcm Sp-8-CPT-cAMPS for 2 h to increase the cAMP level. After this treatment, PF stimulation failed to induce a change in mIPSC frequency ( = 4). , Application of 100 \u03bcm Sp-8-CPT-cAMPS for 15 min induced a long-lasting increase in the mIPSC frequency without a change in the amplitude ( = 5). , Incubation with 50 \u03bcm forskolin for 2 h prevented the PF stimulation-induced change in mIPSC frequency ( = 5). , Application of 50 \u03bcm forskolin for 15 min induced a long-lasting increase of the mIPSC frequency ( = 7). , PKA inhibition blocked the NMDAR-induced I-LTP, but did not prevent the forskolin-triggered lasting increase in mIPSC frequency ( = 3). , Summary data. Error bars indicate SEM.Finally, we tested whether an increase in the cAMP level was sufficient to enhance spontaneous GABA release. Indeed, a short application (15 min) of 100 \u03bcm Sp-8-CPT-cAMPS triggered a long-lasting increase in mIPSC frequency (Fig. 6) (114.2 \u00b1 26.8%;  = 5;  < 0.03) without any change in mIPSC amplitude (1.8 \u00b1 3%). A lasting enhancement of mIPSC frequency was also observed after 50 \u03bcm forskolin application (Fig. 6) (frequency, 84.3 \u00b1 25.9%;  = 7;  < 0.03; amplitude, 17.3 \u00b1 11.1%).However, the forskolin-induced increase in GABA release was independent of PKA activation. After KT5720 treatment, NMDA and glycine application failed to induce I-LTP, but a brief application of 50 \u03bcm forskolin still triggered a sustained increase in mIPSC frequency (Fig. 6). As a control, 1,9-dideoxyforskolin, an inactive forskolin analog, did not produce an enduring increase in GABA release (data not shown) (6.9 \u00b1 7.7%;  = 3). Thus, the forskolin-induced increase in mIPSC frequency requires elevated cAMP levels, but does not entirely depend on PKA activation, consistent with previous observations (Lonart et al., 1998; Beaumont and Zucker, 2000; Castillo et al., 2002; Zhong and Zucker, 2005).Together, these results show that PF stimulation-induced I-LTP requires an increase in cAMP production and PKA activation. Our results are consistent with a presynaptic site of PKA activation, but we cannot rule out that other neurons or glial cells are possible sites of PKA activation.RIM1\u03b1 is a protein that is localized to the active zone and participates in the regulation of neurotransmitter release at both glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals (Schoch et al., 2002). RIM1\u03b1 is a substrate for PKA, and phosphorylation of RIM1\u03b1 by PKA is required for presynaptic LTP at a number of excitatory synapses (Castillo et al., 2002; Lonart, 2002; Lonart et al., 2003).Using RIM1\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice, we examined the role of RIM1\u03b1 in I-LTP. We first tested whether deletion of RIM1\u03b1 altered the basal excitability of stellate cells. We recorded spontaneous action potentials in stellate cells and observed no difference in the amplitude, the afterhyperpolarization (AHP), and half-width of spontaneous action potentials between RIM1\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 and wild-type stellate cells (Table 1). Depolarizing current injections evoked action potentials at the same frequency in both RIM1\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 and wild-type stellate cells (Fig. 7,). Hence the baseline excitability of stellate cells is unchanged in RIM1\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice.Neuronal excitability characterized in wild-type and RIM1\u2212/\u2212 mice: action potential propertiesI-LTP requires RIM1\u03b1. , A ramp of depolarizing current (bottom trace) mimicking an NMDAR-mediated synaptic current was used to trigger action potential firing in stellate cells from wild-type (WT) (middle trace) and RIM1\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice (top trace). , The frequency of the evoked action potentials during the ramp was plotted against the peak amplitude of the current injection (WT,  = 7; mutant,  = 8). , A burst of PF stimulation evoked an NMDAR-mediated current in stellate cells from a wild-type mouse and a RIM1\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mouse. , , Parallel fiber stimulation failed to trigger an increase in the mIPSC frequency in RIM1\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice ( = 5). , NMDA and glycine application also did not induce an increase in the mIPSC frequency in RIM1\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice with the exception of one cell that showed a 41% potentiation ( = 6). Error bars indicate SEM.Because the activation of NMDARs by glutamate released from PFs is required for the induction of I-LTP, we tested whether the probability of glutamate release was altered at the PF-to-stellate cell synapse in RIM1\u03b1 knock-out mice. Glutamate release was evaluated using the paired-pulse ratio of EPSCs evoked by stimulation of PFs in stellate cells. We detected no difference in the paired-pulse ratio of EPSCs between RIM1\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 and wild-type animals (Table 2), consistent with observations at the PF-to-Purkinje cell synapse (Castillo et al., 2002). To determine the ability of burst PF stimulation to activate NMDAR-mediated currents in stellate cells, we measured extrasynaptic NMDAR-mediated currents evoked by PF stimulation when stellate cells were voltage clamped at +40 mV. The stimulation-evoked NMDAR-mediated currents in RIM1\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 animals had similar amplitude and kinetics to the wild-type mice (Fig. 7) (NMDAR-mediated current charge: wild type, 55.9 \u00b1 13.7 nA \u00b7 s; RIM1\u03b1\u2212/\u2212, 45.3 \u00b1 28.6 nA \u00b7 s;  = 5; not significant). These data suggest that glutamate release and spillover from PFs is not altered in the RIM1\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mouse.Neuronal excitability characterized in wild-type and RIM1\u2212/\u2212 mice: basic excitatory and inhibitory transmission propertiesThe basal release of GABA from stellate cells was also not altered in the RIM1\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice because the frequency and amplitude of mIPSCs in stellate cells and the paired-pulse ratio of evoked IPSCs was not different between wild-type and knock-out animals (Table 2).We then investigated whether I-LTP could still be induced in RIM1\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 cerebellar slices. Burst stimulation of parallel fibers failed to induce a change in the frequency and amplitude of mIPSCs (Fig. 7,) (frequency, \u22124.8 \u00b1 5.1%; amplitude, \u221222.5 \u00b1 10.5%;  = 5). Consistent with the involvement of RIM1\u03b1 in I-LTP, bath application of NMDA and glycine also did not trigger a lasting increase in mIPSC frequency (Fig. 7). Because PF stimulation and NMDA/glycine application can both induce I-LTP in wild-type mice (Figs. 1, 5), these results shows that the active zone protein RIM1\u03b1 is essential for I-LTP.Recent studies have revealed that sensory and emotional experiences can give rise to long-lasting changes in inhibitory synaptic transmission in a number of brain regions, including the cerebellum (Lien et al., 2006; Maffei et al., 2006; Nugent et al., 2007; Scelfo et al., 2008). In this study, we showed that a physiologically relevant stimulation can induce a lasting increase in GABA release from cerebellar stellate cells. Our results indicate that the molecular mechanism(s) underlying I-LTP involve the elevation of cAMP levels, the activation of PKA, and require RIM1\u03b1. This sustained increase in GABA release alters the firing pattern of stellate cells and thus will modify interneuronal network activity within the cerebellum.Sensory stimulation has been shown to evoke a short burst of action potentials at high frequency in cerebellar granule cells  (Chadderton et al., 2004). This type of activity results in glutamate spillover and the activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors in cerebellar interneurons (Carter and Regehr, 2000; Clark and Cull-Candy, 2002; Sun and Liu, 2007). Here, we show that just a few bursts of PF activity that mimic the  firing pattern of granule cells are sufficient to induce I-LTP, which is manifested as a long-lasting increase in GABA release from stellate cells. This effect requires the activation of NMDA receptors in presynaptic stellate cells (Liu and Lachamp, 2006). These results raise the possibility that the NMDAR-mediated sustained enhancement of GABA release could occur  and may participate in associative memory formation in the cerebellum (Scelfo et al., 2008).Glutamate can regulate inhibitory transmitter release via postsynaptic NMDA or metabotropic glutamate receptors. Activation of these receptors can generate retrograde signals, such as NO and cannabinoids, that act on the terminals of the presynaptic neurons and alter GABA release (Maejima et al., 2001; Robbe et al., 2002; Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2003; Nugent et al., 2007). There is also evidence that the activation of presynaptic NMDA receptors, when coincident with high-level GABAergic activity, is required for the induction of presynaptic LTD in the developing  retinotectal system (Lien et al., 2006). Several lines of evidence suggest that activation of presynaptic NMDARs is required for the induction of I-LTP in stellate cells. First, NMDAR blockers prevented the PF stimulation-induced increase in both spontaneous and evoked GABA release. Second, direct activation of NMDARs by a brief application of NMDA and glycine triggered I-LTP. Thus, activation of NMDARs is necessary and sufficient to induce a lasting increase in GABA release from stellate cells. Third, the induction of I-LTP appears to be independent of metabotropic glutamate receptors, NO, cannabinoid receptors, and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors. Fourth, NMDA/glycine application induced I-LTP that was not affected by BAPTA in the postsynaptic stellate cells, but was abolished in a Ca-free extracellular solution. This suggests that Ca entry into presynaptic neurons is required for the induction of I-LTP (Liu and Lachamp, 2006). Thus, presynaptic NMDA receptors may serve as a sensor for parallel fiber activity, and the resulting glutamate spillover triggers intracellular signaling in the presynaptic terminal, leading to a sustained alteration in the release of an inhibitory transmitter. The site of I-LTP expression is presynaptic and therefore differs from the rebound potentiation of inhibitory transmission observed in Purkinje cells after climbing fiber stimulation, which appears to be mediated postsynaptically (Kano et al., 1992). This glutamate-induced change in inhibitory transmission that we have observed could alter the balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs or fine-tune the activity of neuronal networks within the cerebellum.RIM1\u03b1, a presynaptic active zone protein, interacts with a number of presynaptic proteins, including Rab3a, which binds to synaptic vesicles, Ca2+ channels, synaptotagmin, and Munc 13 (for review, see Kaeser and S\u00fcdhof, 2005). As the main RIM isoform expressed in the CNS, RIM1\u03b1 is present in many excitatory and inhibitory terminals. Studies of the function of RIM1\u03b1 have revealed diverse roles in transmitter release. Genetic deletion of RIM1\u03b1 enhances glutamate release at the Schaffer collateral\u2013CA1 synapse, but reduces GABA release at the stratum radiatum interneuron\u2013CA1 synapse (Schoch et al., 2002). In contrast, basal synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses, cerebellar parallel fiber-to-Purkinje cell synapses, and inhibitory synapses between stellate cells are not altered in RIM1\u03b1 knock-out mice (Castillo et al., 2002; Lonart et al., 2003; this study). At these synapses, RIM1\u03b1 has been shown to play a pivotal role in activity-induced lasting changes in transmitter release, including both presynaptic LTP and LTD. Deletion of RIM1\u03b1 abolishes presynaptic LTP at the hippocampal mossy fiber and cerebellar parallel fiber synapses, but enhances mossy fiber LTD (Castillo et al., 2002; Lonart et al., 2003). A recent study showed that cannabinoid-mediated LTD at inhibitory synapses in hippocampal CA1 neurons and in the basolateral amygdala requires the presence of RIM1\u03b1 (Chevaleyre et al., 2007). In the present study, we found that RIM1\u03b1 was also necessary for the NMDAR-induced I-LTP observed at inhibitory synapses between cerebellar stellate cells. Therefore, RIM1\u03b1 plays a central role in long-term modulation of both excitatory and inhibitory transmitter release. Although the stimulus that induces presynaptic plasticity varies at these different synapses, the same signaling pathway involving a cAMP\u2013PKA\u2013RIM1\u03b1 cascade seems to be involved. Thus, this pathway is a general mechanism for presynaptic plasticity in the CNS.How does RIM1\u03b1 regulate neurotransmitter release during long-term synaptic plasticity? Deletion of RIM1\u03b1 reduces the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles (Calakos et al., 2004), whereas upregulation of RIM1\u03b1 enhances release probability (Yao et al., 2007). A recent study revealed that RIM1 suppressed the inactivation of voltage-gated calcium channels via its association with the \u03b2 subunits of calcium channels (Kiyonaka et al., 2007). Thus, RIM1 may enhance neurotransmitter release through its association with presynaptic proteins that facilitate vesicle docking or by controlling Ca2+ influx. One common feature of presynaptic LTP/LTD is the requirement for activation of PKA (Weisskopf et al., 1994; Salin et al., 1996; Storm et al., 1998; Tzounopoulos et al., 1998; Villacres et al., 1998; Linden and Ahn, 1999; Lonart et al., 2003; Chevaleyre et al., 2007). RIM1\u03b1 is a substrate for PKA and phosphorylation of RIM1\u03b1 at Ser413 is essential for presynaptic LTP (Lonart et al., 1998, 2003). RIM1\u03b1 interacts with Rab3a on the vesicular membrane, and this regulates synaptic vesicle fusion (Geppert et al., 1997; Schl\u00fcter et al., 2004). Although Rab3a itself is not a substrate for PKA, presynaptic LTP at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses is impaired in the Rab3a-deficient mouse (Castillo et al., 1997). Thus, signaling via Rab3a, perhaps though its interactions with RIM1\u03b1, is required for presynaptic LTP.What are the functional consequences of the long-lasting change in inhibitory transmission that we have described? First, enhanced feedforward inhibitory (stellate cell) and excitatory (PF) transmission in the cerebellar cortex enables Purkinje cells to integrate excitatory inputs with a high temporal fidelity (Scelfo et al., 2008). Thus, inhibitory transmission is required to maintain temporal resolution within the cerebellar network. Second, because stellate cells also innervate each other, an increase in GABA release is likely to additionally alter the interneuron network activity. Chavas and Marty (2003) found that the reversal potential of GABAergic currents in stellate cells is \u221258 mV at room temperature and that both excitatory and inhibitory GABA synapses coexist in the cerebellar interneuron network. However, the reversal potential at a near-physiological temperature appears to be more hyperpolarized at approximately \u221280 mV (Carter and Regehr, 2002; Liu and Lachamp, 2006), and therefore GABAergic transmission is likely to be inhibitory. Indeed, our results show that enhanced GABA release from stellate cells reduces the spike rate and alters the pattern of action potential firing in nearby stellate cells, such that the postsynaptic cells fire in bursts. A change in the firing pattern of stellate/basket cells is likely to be influential because these neurons control the timing and firing frequency of Purkinje cells, which are themselves the sole output from the cerebellum (Midtgaard, 1992; H\u00e4usser and Clark, 1997; Jaeger and Bower, 1999). Finally, inhibitory networks participate in the generation of synchronized oscillations (Csicsvari et al., 1999; McBain and Fisahn, 2001; Buzs\u00e1ki, 2002; Klausberger et al., 2003; Bartos et al., 2007; Middleton et al., 2008). Thus, a lasting increase in GABA release may be a general means to promote oscillatory activity within many types of neuronal networks.This work was supported by National Science Foundation Grant IBN-0344559 and National Institutes of Health Grant NS58867 (S.J.L.).

All eight reconstructed tyrosine hydroxylase-positive dopaminergic neurons possessed widely spread and highly dense axonal arborizations in the neostriatum. All of them emitted very little axon collateral arborization outside of the striatum except for tiny arborization in the external pallidum. The striatal axonal bush of each reconstructed dopaminergic neuron covered 0.45\u20135.7% (mean \u00b1 SD = 2.7 \u00b1 1.5%) of the total volume of the neostriatum. Furthermore, all the dopaminergic neurons innervated both striosome and matrix compartments of the neostriatum, although each neuron's arborization tended to favor one of these compartments. Our findings demonstrate that individual dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra can broadcast a dopamine signal and exert strong influence over a large number of striatal neurons. This divergent signaling should be a key to the function of the nigrostriatal system in dopamine-based learning and suggests that neurodegeneration of individual nigral neurons can affect multiple neurons in the striatum. Thus, these results would also contribute to understanding the clinicopathology of Parkinson's disease and related syndromes.Dopamine-containing neurons are distributed in the retrorubral field (RRF), substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), and ventral tegmental area (VTA), which correspond to cell groups A8, A9, and A10, respectively, in the mammalian mesencephalon (Dahlstroem and Fuxe, 1964). These dopamine-containing neurons have a strong influence on emotion, motivation and cognitive processes mainly by the projection from the VTA to limbic forebrain areas, and on motor control chiefly by the projection from the SNc and RRF to the neostriatum (for review, see Joel and Weiner, 2000; Bj\u00f6rklund and Dunnet, 2007). It has also been suggested that dopamine signal serves as a reinforcement signal in those regions (for review, cf. Schultz, 1998). The neostriatum, being a main input nucleus of the basal ganglia, receives massive cortical and thalamic inputs and sends inhibitory projections to the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe), entopeduncular nucleus [internal segment of the GP (GPi)] and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), the latter two structures being output nuclei of the basal ganglia circuit. Furthermore, the neostriatum is known to have a mosaic organization and be composed of patch/striosome and matrix compartments which are distinguishable from each other by the expression of neurochemical markers and by input\u2013output organization (Graybiel and Ragsdale, 1978; Bowen et al., 1981; Herkenham and Pert, 1981; Gerfen, 1984, 1985, 1989; Gerfen et al., 1985, 1987a,b; Donoghue and Herkenham, 1986; Jimenez-Castellanos and Graybiel, 1987; Langer and Graybiel, 1989; Kaneko et al., 1995). In particular, neurons in the striosome compartment are known to send their inhibitory axons selectively to the SNc (Gerfen, 1985), whereas those in the matrix compartment project directly or indirectly to the SNr and GPi (Alexander et al., 1990).Recently, we have developed a new recombinant viral vector which labels the infected neurons in a Golgi-stain-like manner (Furuta et al., 2001). This vector is based upon a replication-defective Sindbis virus and designed to express green fluorescent protein (GFP) with a membrane-targeting palmitoylation signal of GAP-43 (palGFP) under the control of a powerful subgenomic promoter of the virus. Sindbis virus is known to have high infection efficiency to a broad range of hosts, including neural cells (for review, cf. Xiong et al., 1989; Schlesinger, 1993; Piper et al., 1994; Strauss and Strauss, 1994; Lundstrom, 1999). Furthermore, since a large amount of palGFP is produced and distributed not only on the somatodendritic membrane but also on the axonal membrane of infected neurons (Furuta et al., 2001), the vector has been used as a highly sensitive anterograde tracer in the CNS (Nakamura et al., 2002, 2004, 2005; Ito et al., 2007). In the present study, we used the recombinant Sindbis virus vector as a tool for single-neuron labeling of dopaminergic neurons. We determined the dopaminergic characteristics of the infected neurons immunocytochemically, and visualized highly extensive axonal arborization of single nigrostriatal dopamine neurons. The axonal arborization was further examined in association with the striosome and matrix compartments of the neostriatum to clarify whether single dopamine signals exerted a selective influence upon the two different compartments in the neostriatum.Forty-two adult male Wistar rats, weighing 250\u2013310 g, were used. Experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Committee for Animal Care and Use of the Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, and those for Recombinant DNA Study, Kyoto University. All efforts were made to minimize the suffering and number of animals used in the present study.Rats were anesthetized by ether inhalation and intraperitoneal injection of chloral hydrate (35 mg/100 g body weight). Five to 10 infectious units of palGFP- or GFP-expressing Sindbis virus vector (Furuta et al., 2001) in 0.5 \u03bcl of PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin were injected bilaterally into the SNc (5.3\u20135.5 mm posterior to the bregma, 2.2\u20132.4 mm lateral to the midline, and 7.2\u20137.7 mm deep from the brain surface) by pressure through a glass micropipette attached to Picospritzer III (General Valve Corporation). After survival for 36\u201342 h, the rats were reanesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of chloral hydrate (70 mg/100 g body weight), and perfused transcardially with 200 ml of PBS [0.9% (w/v) saline buffered with 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4], followed by 200 ml of 3% (w/v) formaldehyde, 75% saturated picric acid and 0.1 m Na2HPO4 (adjusted with NaOH to pH 7.0) over 30 min. The brains were then removed, cut at the midline into two hemispheric blocks, and postfixed for 4 h at 4\u00b0C with the same fixative. After cryoprotection with 30% (w/w) sucrose in PBS, the blocks were cut into 40-\u03bcm-thick parasagittal sections on a freezing microtome, and the sections were collected serially in PBS.The sections including the injection site were observed under epifluorescent microscope Axiophot 2 (Zeiss) with an appropriate filter set (excitation, 450\u2013490 nm; emission, 515\u2013565 nm) for fluorescence of GFP to find SN neurons infected with the virus. All the following incubations described hereafter were performed at room temperature and followed by a rinse with PBS containing 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 0.02% (w/v) merthiolate (PBS-X). The sections containing palGFP-positive SN neurons were incubated overnight with 1:200-diluted mouse ascites containing anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) monoclonal IgG1 (clone LNC1; Millipore) in PBS-X containing 0.25% (w/v) \u03bb-carrageenan, 0.02% sodium azide and 1% (v/v) donkey serum (PBS-XCD), and then for 4 h with 1 \u03bcg/ml AlexaFluor 594-conjugated anti-[mouse IgG] goat antibody (Invitrogen) in PBS-XCD. Under the epifluorescence microscope with appropriate filter sets for GFP fluorescence and AlexaFluor 594 (excitation, 530\u2013585 nm; emission, \u2265615 nm), palGFP-labeled neurons were examined to determine whether they expressed immunoreactivity for TH (Fig. 1).All the sections containing single palGFP-labeled and TH-immunopositive neurons were incubated overnight with a mixture of 0.4 \u03bcg/ml affinity-purified rabbit antibody to GFP (Tamamaki et al., 2000) and 2 \u03bcg/ml affinity-purified guinea pig antibody to \u03bc-opioid receptor (MOR) (Kaneko et al., 1995) in PBS-XCD. The incubation medium for the sections immunolabeled for TH further contained 10% (v/v) normal mouse serum to block the reaction with bound mouse antibody. After a rinse with PBS-X, the sections were incubated for 2 h with 10 \u03bcg/ml biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG donkey antibody (Millipore) in PBS-XCD, and then for 1 h with avidin-biotinylated peroxidase complex (ABC Elite; Vector) in PBS-X. After a rinse with PBS, the bound peroxidase was developed black by reaction for 10\u201330 min with 0.02% (w/v) diaminobenzidine-4HCl, 10 mm nickel-ammonium sulfate and 0.0003% (v/v) H2O2 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 (Fig. 1). The reaction was terminated by a rinse with PBS containing 2% (w/v) sodium azide, followed by two rinses in PBS. Subsequently, the sections were further incubated for 2 h with 10 \u03bcg/ml of biotinylated anti-guinea pig IgG donkey antibody (Millipore) in PBS-XCD, and then for 1 h with the avidin-biotinylated peroxidase complex in PBS-X. Finally, the second bound peroxidase was visualized violet\u2013red by reaction for 10\u201330 min with 0.01% (w/v) Tris-aminophenol methane, 0.07% (v/v) -cresol and 0.003% (v/v) H2O2 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 (Fig. 1,) (Kaneko et al., 1994). All the above incubations and reactions were performed at room temperature. The stained sections were serially mounted onto the gelatinized glass slides, dried up, washed in running water, dried up again, cleared in xylene, and finally coverslipped with mounting medium MX (Matsunami).The cell body, dendrites, and projecting main axon of stained dopamine neurons were reconstructed under a microscope attached with camera lucida apparatus. In particular, the striatal axon fibers were photographed with a digital camera attached to the microscope with a 20\u00d7 objective, and then traced on the photograph with software CANVAS 9 (ACD Systems International) in a computer. The axon fibers in a section were reconstructed one by one onto a parasagittal plane, and superimposed to create the medial view in the computer. For the frontal and dorsal views, the extent of axon fibers in each 40-\u03bcm-thick section was superimposed on frontal and horizontal planes, respectively, with software ImageJ (NIH; http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). The length of axons was obtained separately in the striosome and matrix compartments by calculating the length of traced lines with \u201cObject Information\u201d function in software Canvas 9.The location of infected neurons was determined by cytoarchitecture. After tracing of infected neurons and axon fibers, the coverslips were removed from glass slides and the mounted sections were counterstained for Nissl with Neutral Red (Acros Organics). In addition, control parasagittal sections of rat mesencephalon were serially stained for Nissl and immunostained for calbindin D-28k and TH (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). These control sections were used as a reference for defining ventral and dorsal tiers of the SNc by comparing cytoarchitecture with chemoarchitecture of calbindin and TH as described previously (Prensa and Parent, 2001).The difference between dorsal and ventral tier of SNc dopamine neurons was determined using the two-tailed Student's  test and two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney  test.In the present study, we stereotaxically injected Sindbis virus vector for palGFP expression bilaterally into the SN of 42 rats, and thus of 84 hemibrains. The neurons for single-cell tracing were selected as follows: first, the hemiencephalic sections including the injection sites were examined under epifluorescence microscope. The hemibrains which contained only 1\u201310 palGFP-labeled SN neurons were selected. Seventy nigral neurons in 25 hemibrains were thereby processed for further analysis. Second, 70 palGFP-labeled neurons were examined for the expression of TH immunofluorescence, a marker for dopaminergic neurons in the SN (Fig. 1,). Twenty-one of 70 neurons were positive for TH immunoreactivity. Finally, the hemiencephalic sections containing these dopaminergic neurons were further stained by the immunoperoxidase method with anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 1,). Of the 21 stained neurons, the axons of 13 neurons were entangled or overlapped in the striatum with those of another neurons, and thus inseparable for reconstruction. Thus, only 8 neurons were selected for the present morphological analysis of single neurons. In 5 cases of them (Table 1, neurons #2, 5\u20138), a hemibrain contained only one TH-immunopositive neuron. The other 3 neurons were found in a hemisphere, but fortunately separable from one another (Table 1, neurons #1, 3, 4). Since TH-negative SN neurons (mainly located in the SNr) had little, if any, axonal projection to the striatum, it was easy to separate axons of TH-positive neurons from those of TH-negative neurons.Single-neuron labeling with palGFP Sindbis virus vector. A nigral neuron showing green fluorescence of palGFP (, ) was immunolabeled for TH (, ), and further stained black by the immunoperoxidase method with anti-GFP antibody and diaminobenzidine/nickel reaction (DAB/Ni) (). Double arrowheads in  and  point to the same small vessel. Another example for palGFP-labeled TH-positive neurons is indicated by arrowheads in \u201d. The black-stained axon fibers of palGFP-labeled neurons densely innervated the striatum (, ), being distributed both in the striosome/patch and matrix compartments () or with preference for the striosome compartment (). MOR immunoreactivity was used to label the striosome compartments (violet\u2013red areas indicated by arrows in , ). palGFP-labeled axon fibers () were compared with GFP-labeled fibers () at a higher magnification. Scale bar in \u201c applies to , that in  applies to , , and that in  applies to , .The axonal length of dopaminergic neurons in the striatumThese reconstructed neurons were subdivided into two groups based on the location of their cell bodies in the SNc (Fig. 2). By identifying the location of the cell bodies with Nissl counterstaining and by comparing Nissl cytoarchitecture with calbindin-immunoreactive structure in control parasagittal sections (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), five neurons (Table 1, TH-positive neurons #1\u20135) were classified as neurons of the dorsal tier of the SNc (SNcd), and three (#6\u20138) were as neurons of the ventral tier (SNcv). The region around each palGFP-positive neuron was darkly immunostained, probably due to the presence of extracellularly leaked palGFP (Fig. 1), suggesting an extremely strong expression of protein by the subgenomic promoter of Sindbis virus. However, no spread to adjacent cell bodies was observed.The distribution of the eight neurons labeled with palGFP Sindbis virus vector and immunopositive for tyrosine hydroxylase in the substantia nigra. The locations were projected onto a parasagittal plane 2.25 mm lateral to the midline. Each encircled numeral indicates the position of the neuron with the same number in Table 1. cp, Cerebral peduncle; ic, internal capsule; ZI, zona incerta.Simultaneously with GFP immunoperoxidase staining, immunoreactivity for MOR was visualized in violet\u2013red (Fig. 1,, arrows), and used as a marker for the striosome compartment of the striatum (Kaneko et al., 1995). As shown in Figure 1,  and , some axon fibers of palGFP-labeled TH-positive SN neurons seemed to prefer the matrix or striosome compartment to the other compartment. These intrastriatal axons were relatively thick and seemed continuous to varicosities, making it difficult to count varicosities (Fig. 1). Furthermore, axon fibers located in the striosome compartment showed little morphological difference compared with those in the matrix compartment.To examine the effect of the palmitoylation signal on the morphology of intrastriatal axon fibers, we compared palGFP-labeled axon fibers and those labeled with unmodified green fluorescent protein (GFP). As shown in Figure 1,  and , there was no obvious difference between the two fibers. Since intrastriatal axon fibers were not completely labeled with GFP (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), we could not compare global properties such as the total axonal length, but local characteristics between palGFP-labeled axon fibers and well labeled fibers with GFP. For example, the fiber width and interbranch interval of 80 randomly selected GFP-labeled axon fibers were 0.82 \u00b1 0.11 \u03bcm and 31.2 \u00b1 19.4 \u03bcm, respectively. These data were not statistically different ( \u2265 0.72 by the two-sided  test) from those of 80 palGFP-labeled intrastriatal axon fibers, the fiber width and interbranch interval of which were 0.83 \u00b1 0.13 \u03bcm (mean \u00b1 SD) and 30.9 \u00b1 21.6 \u03bcm, respectively (for further detail, see supplemental data, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Thus, as far as we could compare, no significant difference was detected between the GFP-labeled and palGFP-labeled axon fibers.The axons of all eight nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons were isolated and reconstructed by camera lucida drawings as shown in Figures 3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u20137. The representative axonal distribution of neuron #2 is shown in the photographs of supplemental Figure 3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material. In all the reconstructed neurons, the main axon emerged from the cell body or proximal dendrite in the SNc without local axon collaterals around the cell body, then passed through the internal capsule, and then headed directly to the striatum. All but one of the axons emitted very short curly collateral projections in the GPe before entering the striatum (Figs. 3, 5\u21d3\u20137, neuron #2 was the exception). No such collaterals were observed in the GPi. In contrast to the minimal collateral projections within extrastriatal structures, the individual nigrostriatal axons formed widely spread and highly dense axonal bushes within the striatum (Figs. 3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u20137, 3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u20137). The axonal arborizations reconstructed in the striatum were more extended and much denser than those of the nigrostriatal axons described previously (Gauthier et al., 1999; Prensa and Parent, 2001), suggesting that the present method using the palGFP-expressing Sindbis virus vector was a highly sensitive and efficient technique for visualizing the arborization of single axons. The eight SN neurons had a total axonal length, on average, of \u223c467,000 \u03bcm (Table 1, #1\u20138), whereas the seven representative SN neurons of the previous study (Prensa and Parent, 2001) had that of 36,000 \u03bcm (see supplemental Table 1, estimated from the published data, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), <1/10 of the present data. This indicates that the axonal arborization of the previous studies was largely underestimated. The intrastriatal axonal arborizations of neurons #1, 2, 5, 7 and 8 innervated mainly the dorsal part of the striatum, and those of neurons #3, 4 and 6 mainly the middle and ventral parts of the striatum, sometimes including the border between the dorsal striatum and the accumbens nucleus.Camera lucida reconstruction of SNcd neuron #1. , , The axon fibers in the striatum () and dendrites () in the SNc were projected onto a parasagittal plane and superimposed from the medial side. , The dorsal and frontal views of the intrastriatal axonal arborization were reconstructed and compared with the medial view. Red and blue lines in the striatum indicate the axon fibers located in the striosome and matrix compartments, respectively.

This neuron did not emit axon collateral in the GPe, but took a loop-making meandering course through the subthalamic nucleus (STh; ). Main axons meandering in the STh were found only in neurons #2 and #4. See the legend of Figure 3 for further detail.Camera lucida reconstruction of SNcd neuron #3. Of the eight neurons examined in the present study, this neuron had the smallest axonal arborization in the striatum. See the legend of Figure 3 for further detail.Camera lucida reconstruction of SNcv neuron #7. The axons of this SNcv neuron showed the highest preference for the striosome compartment in the present results and made two bushes in the neostriatum. Red fibers at the top of  were located in MOR-positive subcallosal streaks. See the legend of Figure 3 for further detail.Camera lucida reconstruction of SNcv neuron #8. Although the cell body of this neuron was located at the cell cluster region of the SNcv, the axonal arborization was very similar to that of SNcd neuron #1 (Fig. 3). See the legend of Figure 3 for detail.The five SNcd neurons had total axonal lengths of 140,000\u2013780,000 \u03bcm (Table 1, #1\u20135). The typical wide spread arborizations of intrastriatal axons was observed in dopamine neurons #1, #2, #4 and #5, and those of neurons #1 and #2 were reconstructed in Figures 3 and 4, respectively. The arbors occupied oval volumes that extended 1.5\u20132.0 mm rostrocaudally, 0.7\u20131.0 mm dorsoventrally and 1.0\u20131.5 mm mediolaterally. The total axonal lengths of these four neurons ranged from 280,000\u2013780,000 \u03bcm (Table 1). The striatal volume covered with the dense axonal plexus was estimated to be 0.09\u20131.12 mm3 (Table 2) and reached a maximum of 5.7% of the total neostriatal volume on one side (19.81 \u00b1 0.63 mm3,  = 3). SNcd dopamine neuron #3 was an exceptional case with a smaller and mediolaterally flat axonal bush, shown in Figure 5. This arbor formed a small terminal field in the fundus of the caudoputamen as a main bush with a large diameter of \u223c500 \u03bcm and a smaller bush arbor extending rostroventral to the main bush. Although this neuron had the smallest axonal bushes in the present study, the total axonal length in the striatum was 140,000 \u03bcm (Table 1).Volume occupied by TH-positive axons and axon fiber density in the striatumThe three SNcv neurons had total axonal lengths of 500,000\u2013610,000 \u03bcm (Table 1, #6\u20138). Two of them (#7 and #8) are illustrated in Figures 6 and 7, respectively. The arbors of SNcv neurons #6 and #8 formed single oval volumes with a major diameter of >1 mm as had shown in SNcd dopamine neurons. Neuron #7 formed two axonal bushes, large and small ones, similar to SNcd neuron #3, although the arborization was much bigger than that of neuron #3.Most intrastriatal axon fibers of the palGFP-labeled dopaminergic neurons were distributed nonselectively in the striosome and matrix compartments (Fig. 1), but some fibers appeared to innervate either the striosome or the matrix compartment preferentially (Fig. 1). Because the labeled fibers possessed many ambiguous varicosities in the striatum (Fig. 1,) and synaptic specializations are not often found at large varicosities but frequently at the thinner parts of dopaminergic axons (Pickel et al., 1981; Arluison et al., 1984; Freund et al., 1984; Zahm, 1992), the intrastriatal length of axon fibers, instead of the density (or the number) of varicosities, was compared between striosome and matrix compartments to evaluate quantitatively the contribution of single dopaminergic neurons to each compartment.The striosome compartment including the subcallosal streak has been reported to occupy 10\u201313% of the total neostriatal volume in the rat (Johnston et al., 1990; Desban et al., 1993). Two SNcd neurons #3 and #5 sent only 4\u20135% of their axon fibers to the striosome compartment (Table 1), and thus appeared to prefer the matrix compartment over the striosome compartment. In contrast, all three SNcv neurons preferred the striosome compartment, although proportionally the striosome innervation constituted only a minority of their total axonal length (16\u201343%). On average, five SNcd neurons sent 10.8 \u00b1 5.2% (mean \u00b1 SD) of axon fibers to striosomes, and three SNcv neurons projected 27.0 \u00b1 11.5% of their axonal arbors to striosomes. The -value of difference between the two groups was 0.0554 by a two-tailed Student's  test, just failing statistical significance. We further examined whether or not SNcd and SNcv neurons showed the difference in local preference for either compartment by evaluating their axonal preference in the regions where the axon fibers were distributed (Table 2). We separately measured the striosome and matrix volumes which were covered by the projecting axon fibers, and then calculated the axon fiber density in the striosome and matrix compartments. In 3 of the 5 SNcd neurons and all of the 3 SNcv neurons, the axon fiber density in the striosome compartment was higher than that in the matrix compartment (Table 2, striosome\u2013matrix density ratio of >1). Furthermore, the striosome\u2013matrix density ratio of SNcv neurons were significantly higher than that of SNcd neurons ( = 0.0357 by the two-tailed  test). Thus the latter comparison partly supported the previously reported finding that SNcv neurons innervate the striosome/patch compartment and that SNcd neurons project preferentially to the matrix compartment (Gerfen et al., 1987a).Notably, even for a given nigrostriatal neuron, the axonal preference for compartments was different between its axonal bushes. SNcd neuron #3 and SNcv neuron #7 both had an isolated small axonal bush that were preferentially distributed in striosomes, despite an overall wide distribution of the entire axon (Figs. 5, 6). This pattern indicates that the target preference of a single axon could be different depending on the striatal terminal fields it innervates, and that dopamine-containing innervation might not be so simple as hypothesized in the simple dopamine-dependent learning model of the basal ganglia circuit.In summary, although each nigrostriatal dopamine neuron showed some preference for the striosome or matrix compartment, all the dopamine neurons innervated both the striosome and matrix compartments. Furthermore, even a single dopamine axon altered its preference for the compartments in a field-by-field manner within the striatum.Analysis of the entire axonal arborizations of single dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons with a new virus tracer demonstrated that the intrastriatal arbors of nigrostriatal neurons were much wider and denser than previously reported (Gauthier et al., 1999; Prensa and Parent, 2001), where single nigrostriatal axons were examined by a labeling method with a small injection of biotinylated dextran-amine into the rat SN. Moreover, although some axon arbors exhibited local preferences for one or the other compartment, all the single nigrostriatal axons innervated both striosome and matrix compartments of the striatum. A further critical finding in the present study is that, except for negligible arbors in the GPe, dopaminergic neurons here had very little arborization outside of the striatum.Compared with previous reports on the nigrostriatal projection (Gauthier et al., 1999; Prensa and Parent, 2001), the largest difference found was the extremely high density of the intrastriatal arborization of the nigrostriatal axons we reconstructed. This difference may be a consequence of much higher sensitivity of the present single-cell tracing method using the palGFP Sindbis virus vector. It is possible that palGFP expression might have affected the axonal arborization of dopamine neurons, given that over-expression of GFP with a palmitoylation signal of GAP-43 N terminus [1\u201314] was reported to induce filopodia formation on the surface membrane of COS-7 cells and on the dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurons (Gauthier-Campbell et al., 2004). However, this possibility is unlikely for the following reasons (see also supplemental data, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). (1) The effect reported was on dendritic membranes, but not on axonal membranes. In the present study, neither filopodia-like nor growth cone-like structures were observed on axon fibers of TH-positive neurons. (2) Even on the dendritic membrane of palGFP-expressing neurons, we detected no morphological differences compared with the previous morphological studies of SNc neurons (Juraska et al., 1977; Preston et al., 1981; Tepper et al., 1987). (3) In a comparative study using GFP Sindbis virus vector, GFP-positive nigrostriatal axon fibers showed characteristics similar to those of palGFP-positive fibers, although the axon fibers were not completely visualized throughout their arborization (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). No difference in the width or interbranch interval of axon fibers was detected between palGFP- and GFP-labeled axon fibers. Therefore, we conclude that palGFP expression seemed to have little, if any, morphological effect on the dopaminergic axons, and thus that naive nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons may have as widely spread and highly dense axonal arborization in the neostriatum as the neurons infected with palGFP Sindbis virus.A second major difference from previous findings concerns the nigrostriatal innervation of striosomes and matrix. The topography of the substantia nigra itself has been reported to provide the organization of the nigrostriatal projection, whereby neurons in the SNcd project chiefly to the matrix, whereas those in the SNcv send axons mainly to the striosome/patch compartment in the rat brain (Gerfen et al., 1987a). In addition, differential nigrostriatal projections in association with striosome and matrix compartments have been reported in cat and primate brains (Jimenez-Castellanos and Graybiel, 1987; Langer and Graybiel, 1989). A segregation of these projections was partially supported by the present findings. There was some preference of SNcd neurons for the matrix compartment and some preference of SNcv neurons for striosomes, but we found that single SNcd or SNcv neurons basically innervated both the striosome and matrix compartments. This means that identical dopamine signals can be sent simultaneously to both striosome and matrix neurons.Some reports favor a projection from striosomes to SNc dopaminergic neurons, although a recent report on monkey brain is in disagreement (Levesque and Parent, 2005): Favoring striosome-to-SNc projections are the findings that fluorescent retrograde tracers injected into rat mesencephalon including the SNc but not the SNr, mostly retrogradely labeled neurons in the striosome/patch compartment (Gerfen, 1985); and immunoreactivity for substance P, which was produced by both patch and matrix neurons, is distributed mainly in the neuropil of the SNr, whereas immunoreactivity for preprodynorphin, expressed more intensely in striosome neurons, is distributed more densely in SNc neuropil than SNr neuropil (Lee et al., 1997). Thus, it seems most likely that striosomes contribute to the production of a dopamine signal by SNc neurons (Schultz, 1998; Doya, 2000). This dopamine signal is sent back to the neostriatum for the long-term modification of corticostriatal and/or thalamostriatal synapses (Calabresi et al., 2000, 2007), resulting in the updates of responsiveness of striatal neurons. The present results indicate that a large number of matrix and striosome neurons are affected by the single dopamine signal emitted by a single SNc neuron.The present results indicate that, on average, 2.7% of neostriatal neurons (Table 2) (0.54 mm3/19.81 mm3 = 0.027) and, at the maximum, 5.7% of neurons (1.12/19.81 = 0.057) are under a strong influence of a single dopamine neuron. Since the rat neostriatum contained 2,790,000 neurons in one side (Oorschot, 1996), and the volume innervated by a single dopamine neuron was, on average, 2.7% of the total neostriatal volume in the present study, \u223c75,000 striatal neurons are estimated to be influenced by a single dopaminergic neuron. The whole striatum might not need to receive a single dopamine signal, because the basal ganglia circuit is functionally segregated into several parallel circuits such as motor, oculomotor, prefrontal, and limbic circuits (for review, see Alexander et al., 1990). However, it is known that electrical synapses are formed between SNc dopaminergic neurons (Grace and Bunney 1983; Vandecasteele et al., 2005), suggesting a mechanism for synchronization or coactivation of dopaminergic neurons. If a single dopamine signal covers the whole striatum, the present results indicate that at least 37 dopaminergic neurons (19.81/0.54 \u224837) have to synchronize and convey the same dopamine signal.Because the rat SNc contained 3500\u20137200 neurons in one side (And\u00e9n et al., 1966; Halliday and Tork, 1986; Oorschot, 1996), it is estimated that a neuron in the rat neostriatum might be under the influence of 95\u2013194 dopaminergic neurons on average (3500\u20137200 \u00f7 (19.81/0.54) \u2248 95\u2013194). This highly overlapping innervation of dopaminergic neurons raises the question of its necessity. The question might partially be answered by the fact that animals have many different kinds of reward-based signals, such as those related to appetitive and sexual behaviors. However, since it is unlikely that animals have a hundred kinds of reward-based signals, another justification seems necessary for this redundancy. The large margin of safety in dopaminergic neurons has been reported in human brains diagnosed as idiopathic Parkinson's disease, as extensive loss (>70%) of neurons in the SNc occurs in most patients before parkinsonian symptoms appear (Hirsch et al., 1988). Since neurons are labile elements and are relatively easily lost from many causes, it is a good strategy for the system composed of such unreliable elements to maintain a high level of redundancy. Thus our findings have important implications for an understanding of the clinicopathology of Parkinson's disease and related neurodegenerative disorders.This work was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research 16200025, 17650100, 18500262, 18700341, and 18700342, and Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas 17022020, 18019017, 18020013, and 20700315 from The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology.

These neuromodulatory actions may have important behavioral functions. In the mollusc, , EPSCs evoked by ventral swim interneuron B (VSI) exhibited intrinsic plasticity; after a spike train, EPSC amplitude increased from a basal state to a potentiated state, which usually lasted >10 min. While the synapse was in a potentiated state, stimulation of a serotonergic dorsal swim interneuron (DSI) decreased VSI synaptic strength, returning it to a basal state. The extent of the DSI-evoked decrement was strongly correlated with the magnitude of the homosynaptic potentiation. This synaptic reset, or depotentiation, by DSI was blocked by the serotonin receptor antagonist methysergide and mimicked by a serotonin puff. In contrast to this state-dependent neuromodulatory action, we found that a previously described DSI-evoked transient enhancement of VSI synaptic strength was state-independent, producing the same multiplicative increase in EPSC amplitude regardless of whether the synapse was in a potentiated or basal state. These two actions also differed in their dependencies on the firing pattern of DSI and VSI action potentials. Results suggest that state-independent synaptic enhancement by DSI may play a short-term role during a swim motor pattern, whereas state-dependent actions may have longer-lasting consequences, resetting VSI synaptic strength after a swim bout. Thus, differences in two neuromodulatory actions at one synapse may allow a serotonergic neuron to play distinct roles at different stages of a motor pattern.Neuromodulation has been defined as an effect of one neuron on the cellular and/or synaptic properties of another neuron (Katz, 1999). There may be a temptation to infer from this that neuromodulatory actions are imposed unilaterally on other cells and synapses. However, neuromodulatory signaling may also be contingent on the state of the neuron or synapse being modulated. For example, in rat prefrontal cortex, the basal level of protein kinase A activity can determine whether serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] will enhance or reduce the amplitude of GABA-evoked currents (Cai et al., 2002). Similarly, the level of neuronal activity determines the direction of change produced by dopaminergic modulation of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (Gu and Yan, 2004). Determining whether such state-dependent neuromodulatory effects occur in neuronal circuits requires the ability to monitor and perturb the neuromodulating neuron as well as the state of the neuron that it modulates.Such experimental control can be obtained using the neuronal circuit underlying the escape swim response of the mollusc, . In this preparation, it has been shown that identified serotonergic neurons called the dorsal swim interneurons (DSIs) (http://NeuronBank.org/Tri0001043) evoke short-term neuromodulatory actions on other swim interneurons (Katz and Frost, 1995; Sakurai and Katz, 2003). In particular, DSI stimulation transiently enhances the synaptic strength of ventral swim interneuron B (VSI) (http://NeuronBank.org/Tri0002436). This heterosynaptic enhancement decays within 15 s after the end of a DSI spike train, making it contingent on the timing of spikes in the DSI and VSI.Here, we found that the VSI synapses can undergo activity-dependent changes in synaptic output from a stable basal state to a potentiated state and that the DSI-evoked transient enhancement of VSI synaptic strength is independent of its current potentiation state. We also determined that DSI evokes an additional state-dependent neuromodulatory action; when the VSI synapse is in the potentiated state, DSI stimulation can depotentiate it, returning it to a basal state. The efficacies of these two neuromodulatory actions differ depending on the pattern of DSI and VSI spiking activity. The recognition that a single neuron can evoke both state-dependent and state-independent actions at the same synapse and that these actions can have different spike-timing dependencies could have important implications for understanding the roles of neuromodulation and plasticity in the nervous system.Specimens of the nudibranch, , were obtained from Living Elements. All experiments were performed on the isolated brain preparation. Briefly, the brain, consisting of the fused cerebropleural and pedal ganglia, was removed from the animal and immediately pinned to the bottom of a Sylgard-lined chamber (1 ml), where it was superfused with saline at 4\u00b0C. Physiological saline composition was (in mm): 420 NaCl, 10 KCl, 10 CaCl2, 50 MgCl2, 10 d-glucose, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. The cell bodies of the neurons were exposed by removing the connective tissue sheath from the surface of the ganglia (Willows et al., 1973). Suction electrodes, made from polyethylene tubing, were placed on pedal nerves including pedal nerves 3, 5, and 6. Then the preparation was left overnight, superfused in saline at 8\u201310\u00b0C to recover from possible damage during the dissection.Neurons were identified by soma location, coloration, synaptic connectivity, and activity pattern at rest and during the swim motor program as previously described (Getting, 1981, 1983). For simplicity, we will refer to VSI-B as VSI for the remainder of this study. To identify neurons, the swim motor program was evoked by stimulating pedal nerve 3 with a train of voltage pulses (5\u201315 V, 1.5 ms) at 5 Hz for 1.5 s via a suction electrode. After identifying the interneurons, the bathing medium was switched to saline containing a high concentration of divalent cations (Hi-Di saline), which raises the threshold for spiking and reduces spontaneous neural firing. The composition of the Hi-Di saline was (in mm): 285 NaCl, 10 KCl, 25 CaCl2, 125 MgCl2, 10 d-glucose, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4 (Sakurai and Katz, 2003). All experiments were conducted in the Hi-Di saline superfused at 2 ml/min at 10\u00b0C.5-HT (Sigma) was dissolved in Hi-Di saline (100 \u03bcm) just before use and puff-applied via glass pipette using a Picospritzer (General Valve). The puffs were given for 5\u201310 ms duration, one to three times at 1\u20132 Hz. Methysergide (Sigma) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma) at 20 mm and diluted to 50 \u03bcm in Hi-Di saline just before use, and bath-applied by switching the superfusion paths (Sakurai and Katz, 2003).Neurons were impaled with glass microelectrodes filled with 3 m KCl (resistance, 8\u201315 M\u03a9). Axoclamp-2B amplifiers (Molecular Devices) were used for all electrophysiological experiments. To examine changes in the synaptic strength of VSI, orthodromic action potentials were evoked by injecting current pulses (4\u201315 nA, 20 ms) into the soma through a second electrode, or through the recording electrode with a balanced bridge circuit. Either a ventral flexion neuron (VFN) or an unidentified VSI follower cell in the ipsilateral pedal ganglion had its membrane potential held at \u221250 mV under two-electrode voltage-clamp mode to measure VSI-evoked EPSCs.Action potentials in DSI were elicited by injecting 20 ms current pulses (7\u201315 nA) through a recording electrode via a balanced bridge circuit. Each current pulse evoked a single spike, allowing the spike frequency to be controlled precisely. To bring the VSI synapse to the potentiated state (compare Fig. 1), VSI was stimulated at 5 Hz for 15 s in most of the present experiments (Sakurai et al., 2007). The frequency 5 Hz was chosen because the stimulus at higher rate often caused failure in generating action potential one-to-one to the stimulus current pulses. The time 15 s was chosen because the VSI action potentials started to fail after 15 s.To calculate the extent of potentiation state (), the extent of decrement (), and the extent of DSI-evoked enhancement () (see Figs. 3 and 5), we first calculated the basal EPSC amplitudes by averaging three EPSCs before the VSI spike train. Then, the potentiated EPSC amplitude was calculated by averaging three EPSCs before the DSI stimulation. The  value is the difference between the basal and potentiated EPSC amplitudes shown as a percentage of the basal EPSC amplitude. The  value was calculated by subtracting the potentiated EPSC amplitude from the average of three EPSCs evoked after the DSI spike train, and shown as a percentage change of the potentiated EPSC amplitude. The  value was calculated by subtracting the average of three EPSCs before the DSI spike train from the EPSC evoked 5 s after the DSI spike train, and shown as a percentage change. The depotentiation (see Figs. 6,, 8,) is the DSI-evoked decrement shown as a percentage change of the magnitude of the potentiation state, which is the difference between the basal and potentiated EPSC amplitudes.Recordings were digitized at 3\u201320 kHz with a 1401plus A/D converter from Cambridge Electronic Design (CED). For data analysis and plots, the amplitudes of EPSCs were normalized to the averaged amplitude of three EPSCs before the test stimulation. Data acquisition and analysis were performed with Spike2 software (CED) and SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific). Statistical comparisons were made using a paired  test or a one-way ANOVA with pairwise multiple comparison by the Student\u2013Newman\u2013Keuls method. In all cases,  < 0.05 was considered significant. Results are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM.VSI exhibited a number of forms of intrinsic or homosynaptic plasticity, i.e., changes in the synaptic output of VSI that depended on its own firing history. Baseline VSI-evoked EPSC amplitudes recorded in a postsynaptic VFN were stable when VSI was stimulated with intracellular current pulses (20 ms, 7nA) to fire one action potential every 30 s. However, after a 15 s, 5 Hz train of action potentials, the VSI-evoked EPSCs switched into a prolonged potentiation state (Fig. 1. During the 5 Hz train, the initial EPSCs rapidly facilitated before depressing to a steady-state amplitude as previously reported for this synapse (Sakurai et al., 2007) (Fig. 1). For 15\u201330 s after the end of the train, the EPSC amplitude was strongly depressed relative to the baseline before the train (Fig. 1,). However, over the course of \u223c90 s, the EPSC amplitude increased above baseline levels to a potentiated state, where it remained, in most preparations, for \u223c5\u201315 min. The exact duration of the potentiation state was variable between preparations. Of the 22 preparations tested, at least 15 remained potentiated for >10 min, with one lasting more than 1 h.Homosynaptic potentiation of the VSI-VFN synapse. , The experimental paradigm for inducing the potentiation state. In Hi-Di saline, VSI was stimulated with intracellular current pulses (20 ms, 7\u201310 nA) to fire one action potential every 30 s while recording EPSCs from VFN under voltage clamp. After the establishment of baseline EPSC amplitude by 3\u20135 stimuli, VSI was stimulated at 5 Hz for 15 s (76 pulses), and then the interval was set back to 30 s again. , Averaged data show a sustained increase in the amplitude of EPSCs after the 5 Hz VSI stimulation ( = 22). Time 0 is set as the time of the last VSI action potential in the 5 Hz train. After the VSI spike train, the EPSC showed a transient decrease followed by sustained potentiation state. The EPSC amplitudes were normalized to the mean amplitude of three EPSCs recorded before the VSI spike train. , The magnitude of the potentiation increased with frequency of VSI spiking ((6,81) = 30.2,  < 0.001, by one-way ANOVA). All trains were 15 s in duration except for 0.5 Hz, which was 16 s. Asterisks indicate a significant difference from the baseline amplitude at 0.067 Hz (30 s interval) ( < 0.05 by pairwise multiple comparison by Student\u2013Newman\u2013Keuls method). There was no significant difference between 5 Hz and 10 Hz ( = 0.63 by pairwise multiple comparison by Student\u2013Newman\u2013Keuls method). , The potentiation state affects frequency facilitation. Paired pulse stimuli (0.2 s interval) were given before (Control, upper trace) and after establishment of the potentiated state (lower trace). The extent of facilitation was markedly reduced when the synapse was in the potentiated state. , A bar graph showing the paired pulse facilitation (PPF) index, which was calculated by dividing the change in the amplitude of EPSC by the amplitude of the first EPSC, showing the relative increase in the second EPSC ( < 0.05, paired  test,  = 10).The magnitude of the potentiation state was dependent on the VSI spike frequency during the train (Fig. 1). Analysis with one-way ANOVA shows that there was a progressive increase in the extent of potentiation as VSI was made to spike at higher frequencies (Fig. 1 legend). The maximal potentiation occurred when VSI was stimulated to fire at 5 Hz or above. The VSI spike frequency needed to produce a half-maximal response was 2.1 Hz. During normal swim motor patterns, VSI fired at frequencies ranging from 4.3 to 12.0 Hz with a median of 8.9 Hz ( = 13). Thus, the firing rates needed to cause potentiation are well within the physiological range.To test whether the potentiation state is caused by presynaptic changes in neurotransmitter release from VSI, we examined its effect on paired-pulse facilitation (Fig. 1), a measure typically associated with changes in synaptic release (Zucker and Regehr, 2002). In the unpotentiated state, the paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) index for VSI-evoked EPSCs with a 0.2 s interval was 0.34 \u00b1 0.07 ( = 10). This ratio decreased significantly to 0.10 \u00b1 0.05 ( = 10) when the synapse was in the potentiated state (Fig. 1), suggesting that the potentiation state at least involves presynaptic changes at the synapse.DSI stimulation caused a marked decrement of VSI synaptic strength, but only when the synapse was already in the potentiated state. When the VSI to VFN synapse was in the basal, unpotentiated state, stimulating DSI to fire a train of action potentials (10 Hz, 5 s) that ended 25 s before a VSI test spike had no effect on subsequent VSI-evoked EPSCs recorded in VFN (Fig. 2\n,). However, when the VSI to VFN synapse was in the potentiated state after a VSI spike train, DSI stimulation caused a large decrement of the EPSCs that returned the amplitudes of VSI-evoked EPSCs to the baseline level recorded before the VSI spike train (Fig. 2, 3).Heterosynaptic depotentiation by a DSI spike train. DSI reduced the VSI-VFN EPSC amplitude only when the synapse was in the potentiated state. , Experimental protocol. Intracellular electrodes were placed in DSI and VSI for eliciting action potentials. The membrane potential of the postsynaptic VFN was held constant by two-electrode voltage clamp. VSI was stimulated to fire one action potential every 30 s. DSI was stimulated to fire a train of action potentials (10 Hz, 5 s) that ended 25 s before the next VSI spike. , DSI stimulus trials were delivered once before () and twice after (, ) a VSI spike train (5 Hz, 15 s). , EPSC amplitudes from two recording sessions in the same neurons, one without DSI stimulation (white circles) and one showing three trials of DSI stimulation (, , , black triangles:). The first DSI spike train () had no effect on EPSC amplitude. The 5 Hz VSI spike train shifted the EPSCs into a potentiated state. In the potentiated state, a DSI spike train depotentiated the EPSCs (). A subsequent DSI train had little additional effect (). , The mean amplitudes of VSI-evoked EPSCs normalized to the basal state are shown from three conditions: , basal state (before VSI spike train,  = 8); , potentiated state (first trial after VSI train,  = 12); , basal state (second trial after VSI train,  = 8). The DSI spike train is represented by the arrow. The insets show the EPSC recordings before and 25 s after the DSI stimulation.The extent of DSI-evoked decrement is dependent on the magnitude of the potentiation. , Overlaid plots of the normalized EPSCs against time (seconds). Time 0 is set as the time of the last action potential in the VSI spike train (5 Hz, 15 s). In each plot, a DSI spike train was stimulated at three different times with respect to the end of the VSI train (blue, 315 s; orange, 555 s; green, 795 s). The amplitudes were normalized to the average of 3 EPSCs before the VSI tetanus. The bracket and the arrow indicate the extent of potentiation () at the time of DSI stimulation and decrement () produced by DSI for the trial indicated in blue. , The extent of DSI-evoked decrement is correlated to the amount of the potentiation state (2 = 0.47). The DSI-evoked decrement (%) was plotted as a function of the magnitude of potentiation (%). The  values were shown as a percentage change from the basal EPSC amplitude, whereas the  values as a percentage change from the potentiated EPSC amplitude (see Materials and Methods for details). Data from 15 preparations are plotted; each symbol represents data from a single preparation. There was a negative-slope, linear relationship between the extent of the decrement and the degree of potentiation (2 = 0.47, (1,76) = 59.4,  < 0.001 by ANOVA).In 73% of the preparations, the EPSC decrement was apparently permanent; the EPSC remained at the nonpotentiated level for at least 10 min ( = 9 in 12 preparations), and additional DSI stimuli had no further effect (Fig. 2, ). However, in 3 of 12 preparations, the EPSCs partially reverted to the potentiated level after the first DSI stimulation, but a second DSI spike train again reset the EPSC amplitude to the baseline level.Analysis with one-way ANOVA shows that DSI-evoked decrement in the EPSC size was significant when the VSI synapse was in a potentiated state (, (12,142) = 15.42,  < 0.001,  = 12). Pairwise multiple comparisons by the Student\u2013Newman\u2013Keuls method showed significant differences between the EPSCs before the DSI stimulation and those after it ( < 0.001). In contrast, DSI had little effect when the synapse was in the basal state before the VSI spike train (, (12,77) = 0.44,  = 0.94,  = 8), or by the second DSI stimulation after the VSI spike train (, (12,87) = 0.91,  = 0.54,  = 8). Thus, the ability of DSI to cause VSI synaptic decrement was dependent on the state of the VSI synapse.The extent of the DSI-evoked decrement of VSI synaptic strength was correlated with the magnitude of the potentiation state exhibited at the time of the DSI stimulation (Fig. 3). As the potentiation state slowly decayed, the synaptic decrement caused by DSI stimulation correspondingly decreased (Fig. 3, ), rarely exceeding the magnitude of the remaining potentiation (Fig. 3, ). Indeed, there was a linear relation between the extent of the decrement and the degree of potentiation (Fig. 3). These results suggest that the DSI-evoked decrement was a negation of the potentiation state rather than a scaling of synaptic strength.We previously showed that DSI stimulation causes a transient enhancement of VSI synaptic strength that lasts up to 15 s (Sakurai and Katz, 2003). This enhancement is not seen in Figures 2 and 3 because VSI was stimulated 25 s or more after the end of the DSI train. To test whether the transient enhancement was affected by the potentiation state of the VSI synapse, we shifted the time of the DSI spike train so that it ended just 5 s before the next VSI test spike (Fig. 4, inset). We found that this stimulus paradigm produced a transient enhancement of VSI synaptic strength regardless of whether the synapse was in a potentiated state or not (Fig. 4,).DSI produces both a transient enhancement and a state-dependent decrement of VSI-evoked synaptic currents. , The experimental protocol is the same as in Figure 2 except that the DSI spike trains ended 5 s before the next VSI spike. VSI was stimulated to fire one spike every 30 s. , EPSC amplitudes from two recording sessions in the same neurons, one without DSI stimulation (white circles) and one showing three trials of DSI stimulation (black triangles: , , ). In each trial, DSI stimulation increased the amplitude of the EPSC evoked 5 s after the DSI train, but not 35 s later. The 5 Hz VSI spike train shifted the EPSCs into a potentiated state. In the potentiated state, a DSI spike train transiently increased the EPSC and then caused a prolonged depotentiation (). A subsequent DSI train again caused a transient increase, but did not produce any further decrease in EPSC amplitude (). , Plots showing the averaged effects of DSI on the EPSC amplitude in the basal state (,  = 10), the potentiated state (,  = 9), and the depotentiated state (,  = 7). In all three cases, there was a significant increase in the EPSC amplitude 5 s after the DSI stimulus ( < 0.001, by paired  test). Insets show example EPSCs before DSI stimulation and 5 and 35 s after DSI stimulation. , A bar graph showing averaged percentage changes in the amplitude of the EPSCs evoked by VSI spikes 5 s after a DSI spike train. Bars (, , ) represent data obtained in basal state (, white), the potentiated state (within 5 min after a VSI spike train) (, black), and the depotentiated state (, gray). There are no significant differences in the magnitude of changes in the EPSC size among the three (see text). , A bar graph showing mean values of percentage changes in the amplitude of the EPSCs evoked 35 s after a DSI spike train. Bars (, , ) are from the same states as in . The extent of the DSI-evoked decrement was significantly greater during the potentiation state () than during the other two conditions (, ) (see text). Asterisks indicate significant differences from the other two bars ( < 0.001 by pairwise multiple comparison by Student\u2013Newman\u2013Keuls method).Unlike DSI-evoked depotentiation, the magnitude of DSI-evoked transient enhancement was independent of the state of the VSI-VFN synapse; DSI stimulation caused an equivalent enhancement of VSI synaptic strength regardless of whether the synapse was in the basal state, the potentiated state, or the depotentiated state (Fig. 4). The mean values of the increases were not significantly different from each other ((2,29) = 0.27,  = 0.77 by one way ANOVA). The DSI-evoked transient enhancement in the EPSC size was 64.6 \u00b1 7.9% (N = 13) in the unpotentiated state (), 58.1 \u00b1 4.4% ( = 12) in the potentiated state (), and 61.2 \u00b1 7.2% ( = 8) in the depotentiated state (). Furthermore, the magnitude of the transient enhancement did not correlate with the magnitude of the potentiated state (Fig. 5). Thus, the DSI-evoked enhancement produced an equivalent multiplicative scaling of VSI synaptic strength regardless of whether the synapse was in the basal state, the potentiated state, or the depotentiated state.DSI stimulation caused a state-independent transient increase and a state-dependent decrease of VSI EPSC amplitude. , A plot of a single trial showing the normalized EPSC amplitude over time. VSI was stimulated to fire one action potential every 30 s with a single train of action potentials (5 Hz, 15 s) inserted into the paradigm. Time 0 is set as the time of the last action potential in the VSI spike train. The EPSC amplitude increased to the potentiated state (). DSI stimulation (10Hz, 5 s) ending 5 s before the next VSI spike caused a transient enhancement of the EPSC amplitude () and the subsequent decrement (). The EPSCs were normalized to the average of 3 EPSCs before the VSI train. , , Plots from 59 individual trials across nine preparations showing the relationships of enhancement () and decrement () to the extent of potentiation () in each trial. Each symbol represents data from a single preparation. , The extent of DSI-evoked transient enhancement was not correlated with the extent of potentiation. The  values are shown as a percentage change from the basal EPSC amplitude, whereas the  values are shown as a percentage change from the potentiated EPSC amplitude (see Materials and Methods for details). The regression line is almost flat (2 = 0.001, (1,52) = 0.06,  = 0.81 by ANOVA). , The magnitude of the DSI-evoked decrement after the initial enhancement was correlated with the extent of potentiation (2 = 0.61, (1,46) = 70.7,  < 0.001 by ANOVA). Calculations for  and  values are the same as in Figure 3.In contrast, only if the VSI synapse was already in the potentiated state, was the DSI-evoked transient enhancement followed by a strong decrement (35 s after the DSI train), returning the amplitude of EPSCs to the basal level (Fig. 4,), as we had observed with the 25 s test interval (Fig. 2). Once the synapse was depotentiated, additional DSI stimuli produced only the transient enhancement without any further decrement (Fig. 4,). The DSI-evoked decrease in EPSP amplitude was 3.5 \u00b1 3.5% ( = 13) in the basal state () and 6.0 \u00b1 3.3% ( = 8) in the depotentiated state (), whereas in the potentiated state () the mean decrease was 37.5 \u00b1 2.5% ( = 12) (Fig. 4). The magnitude of the DSI-evoked decrement was significantly greater during the potentiated state ((2,29) = 39.9,  < 0.001 by one-way ANOVA). Moreover, the extent of decrement showed a correlation with the extent of the potentiation state (Fig. 5), consistent with the results obtained with the first protocol using a long interval between DSI and VSI (Figs. 2, 3). Thus, unlike the state-independent multiplicative enhancement produced by the same protocol, the DSI-evoked synaptic decrement depended on the state of VSI synapse at the time when DSI was stimulated.To determine whether the termination of the potentiation phase is caused by 5-HT released from DSI, we tested the effect of the 5-HT receptor antagonist, methysergide. Methysergide was previously shown to be effective at blocking DSI-evoked transient enhancement (Katz and Frost, 1995; Sakurai and Katz, 2003). In this study, bath-applied methysergide (50 \u03bcm) significantly reduced the magnitude of DSI-evoked enhancement from 94.3 \u00b1 9.8% down to 16.4 \u00b1 3.7% ( < 0.01 by paired  test,  = 4). Methysergide also significantly reduced the extent of the DSI-evoked depotentiation from \u221275.9 \u00b1 2.3% (control) to \u221221.0 \u00b1 4.0% (methysergide) ( < 0.05 by paired  test,  = 4) (Fig. 6,). In contrast, methysergide did not affect either the basal amplitude of VSI-evoked EPSPs (1.76 \u00b1 0.53 nA in control saline, 1.75 \u00b1 0.47 nA in methysergide;  = 0.98 by paired  test,  = 4) or the magnitude of homosynaptic potentiation (62.6 \u00b1 16.8% increase in control saline, 52.5 \u00b1 16.3% increase in methysergide;  = 0.61 by paired  test,  = 4). These results support the hypothesis that 5-HT released from DSI is responsible for the depotentiation.5-HT mediates the DSI-evoked depotentiation. , The DSI-evoked depotentiation was blocked by a 5-HT receptor blocker, methysergide. VSI-evoked EPSC amplitudes from two trials in the same preparation are plotted; one was recorded in normal high divalent cation saline (Normal Hi-Di, white circles) and the other in the presence of 50 \u03bcm methysergide (black triangles). In both trials, VSI was stimulated to fire a train (5 Hz, 15 s) to put the synapse in a potentiated state and DSI was subsequently stimulated (10 Hz, 5 s) 25 s before the next VSI spike. Depotentiation of the synapse occurred in normal Hi-Di saline, but this depotentiation was reduced significantly by methysergide. , Methysergide significantly reduced the extent of depotentiation caused by DSI stimulation. The extent of depotentiation was shown as a percentage change of the amplitude from the potentiation state ( = 4). , A brief 5-HT puff mimicked the effect of a DSI spike train. EPSC amplitudes from two trials from the same preparation are plotted. In both trials, a VSI spike train (5 Hz, 15 s) caused the synapse to enter the potentiated state. The control trace (white circles) shows the time course of potentiation in this preparation. A pressure-applied 5-HT puff (100 \u03bcm, 10 ms) produced a large transient increase and subsequent fall of the EPSC amplitude, bringing it down to the original level (gray triangles). , 5-HT puffs caused significantly more decrement than occurred in control trials with no puff ( = 4). In  and , time 0 is set as the time of the last action potential in the VSI spike train (5 Hz, 15 s). In  and , asterisks indicate significant differences ( < 0.01 by paired  test).We found that exogenous serotonin can mimic both the DSI-evoked transient enhancement and the depotentiation. By carefully probing the surface of the ganglion with a pipette containing 100 \u03bcm 5-HT, we could locate a spot in which a brief 5-HT puff (5\u201310 ms) produced a transient enhancement of the VSI-to-VFN EPSC. The enhancement of VSI synapses by puff-applied 5-HT lasted >30 s, longer than the DSI-evoked enhancement (10 s). This is presumably because it took longer for the clearance of puff-applied 5-HT than for 5-HT released by a DSI burst. As a result of this longer time course, we could not examine the effect of 5-HT on depotentiation without also causing transient enhancement with our VSI stimulus paradigm.To determine whether puffed 5-HT could mimic the DSI depotentiating effect, we stimulated VSI to fire a train of action potentials (5 Hz, 15 s) to cause homosynaptic potentiation and applied a single puff of 5-HT. This caused a transient enhancement followed by depotentiation of the VSI-evoked EPSC to basal levels (Fig. 6). The extent of depotentiation 90\u2013180 s after the puff was \u221272.4 \u00b1 8.7%, which is significantly greater than the spontaneous decline of the potentiated state (\u221222.7 \u00b1 9.6%) that occurred at equivalent times ( < 0.05 by paired  test,  = 4) (Fig. 6). Thus, puffs of 5-HT could mimic both the transient enhancement and the state-dependent depotentiation of VSI synaptic strength caused by DSI stimulation. Together with the methysergide results, it suggests that 5-HT released by a DSI spike train mediates both state-dependent and state-independent effects.After a VSI spike train, it takes \u223c90 s for the EPSC amplitude to reach the fully potentiated state. We tested whether DSI stimulation before the full onset of potentiation would be effective at causing depotentiation (Fig. 7). We found that when DSI was stimulated after the end of the VSI train, but during the period of VSI synaptic depression, it did not prevent the subsequent expression of the potentiation state (Fig. 7). By increasing the delay after the end of the VSI train, DSI stimulation became more effective at causing depotentiation (Fig. 7,). Thus, the ability of DSI to depotentiate the VSI synapse was not only dependent on the state of the VSI synapse, but also on the timing of the VSI spike train with respect to the DSI train. Of course, this apparent time dependence could simply be another manifestation of the state dependence in that it appears to take 90 s for the synapse to reach the potentiated state.Timing dependence of DSI-evoked depotentiation of VSI synaptic strength. , The time of DSI stimulation was varied with respect to the end of the VSI spike train. For comparison a control trial is shown in which DSI was not stimulated (black circles). , At 5 s after the VSI tetanus, DSI had little effect on potentiation. , At 45 s, DSI partially reduced the magnitude of the potentiation. , After 75 s, DSI stimulation almost completely reduced the magnitude of potentiation. , At 135 s, the potentiation was already maximum and DSI stimulation caused depotentiation. EPSC amplitudes during the VSI 5 Hz spike train are omitted and shown by a gray bar. , Results from nine preparations show the time course over which DSI stimulation becomes effective at depotentiating the synapse. The extent of potentiation after a DSI spike train is shown as percentage of the amplitude of the control potentiation without DSI stimulation, and is plotted against the time of DSI stimulation. DSI stimulation must follow the VSI spike train by at least 60 s to be maximally effective at depotentiation. The plot was fit by a sigmoidal curve, () = /(1 + exp(\u2212( \u2212 0)/)), where  is the time after the end of VSI spike train,  = 1,  = \u221210.4, 0 = 34.8 (2 = 0.82). Inset, A bar graph showing the extent of potentiation binned in 30 s intervals after a VSI spike train (5 Hz). Each bar shows mean \u00b1 SEM. Asterisks indicate significant difference in the magnitude of potentiation with respect to the data at 0\u201330 s ((4,10) = 21.8,  < 0.001 by one-way ANOVA with pairwise multiple comparison by Student\u2013Newman\u2013Keuls method).To begin to determine the functional significance of DSI-evoked enhancement and depotentiation, we examined their sensitivity to parameters of the DSI spike train (spike frequency, spike number and train duration). We stimulated DSI at various spike frequencies either for a fixed duration (Fig. 8) or for a fixed number of spikes (Fig. 8). When we held the duration of the DSI spike train at 5 s (Fig. 8), the magnitude of both the transient enhancement and the depotentiation increased as a function of DSI spike frequency (Fig. 8,). However, when we held the number of DSI spikes constant at 51 pulses and varied the frequency and duration of the DSI spike train (Fig. 8), we found that the enhancement and depotentiation behaved differently (Fig. 8,). For depotentiation, a significant change was seen even at low spike frequencies and no further increase was seen at higher DSI spike frequencies (see Fig. 8 legend), whereas the transient enhancement increased gradually as a function of DSI spike frequency. These results suggest that the magnitude of the DSI-evoked transient enhancement, which lasts just a short time, has a short integration period, whereas the magnitude of the depotentiation depends more on the absolute number of DSI spikes, allowing the depotentiation to be integrated over a long time period.DSI-evoked enhancement and depotentiation differ in their integration times. , The effect of holding the duration of a DSI spike train constant and varying spike frequency (). The magnitudes of both the transient enhancement () and the depotentiation () increased with frequency (or number) of DSI spikes (, (4,33) = 20.4,  < 0.001; , (4,19) = 48.2,  < 0.001, by one-way ANOVA). , The effect of holding the number of DSI spikes constant and varying spike frequency (). The magnitudes of the transient enhancement () increased with DSI spike frequency ((4,44) = 27.9,  < 0.001, by one-way ANOVA). The extent of the DSI-evoked depotentiation () also increased with increasing spike frequency ((4,17) = 153.6,  < 0.001, by one-way ANOVA), but a significant change from control was seen even at low spike frequencies (0\u20132 Hz,  < 0.05 by pairwise multiple comparison by Student\u2013Newman\u2013Keuls method). No further increase in the extent of depotentiation was seen at higher DSI spike frequencies (2\u201310 Hz,  > 0.23 by pairwise multiple comparison by Student\u2013Newman\u2013Keuls method).Both DSI and VSI are the members of the central pattern generator circuit underlying the escape swim response of  (Fig. 9). During the swim motor pattern, DSI and VSI fire bursts of action potentials at 8\u201320 Hz in an alternating manner with a cycle period of 4\u201312 s (Fig. 9) (Getting, 1981, 1983). The swim motor pattern terminates after a VSI burst, and then DSI continues to fire tonically at 1\u20132 Hz, whereas VSI stays silent unless the animal receives tactile stimulation (Popescu and Frost, 2002). We tested the effect of DSI on VSI synaptic output that would occur during and after a swim bout by mimicking this firing pattern and recording the VSI-evoked EPSCs in a VFN.Functional significance of state- and timing-dependent neuromodulation. , A schematic diagram of the neural circuit underlying the swim motor pattern (). Filled triangles represent excitatory synapses and filled circles represent inhibitory synapses. Combinations of triangles and circles are multicomponent synapses. C2, cerebral cell 2; DFN-A,B, dorsal flexion neurons. Based on Getting et al. (1980), Getting (1981), Hume and Getting (1982). All neurons have a contralateral homolog that is not represented. DSI and VSI show alternating bursting activity during a swim motor pattern (). After the swim bout, DSI fires at an elevated tonic firing rate of 1\u20132 Hz. , Testing the role of DSI bursts using an imposed swim-like firing pattern. Bursts of action potentials were evoked repeatedly every 10 s either in VSI only (5 Hz for 5 s) or in both VSI (5 Hz, 5 s) and DSI (10 Hz, 5 s) in alternating manner, mimicking the swim motor pattern. Normalized amplitudes of the VSI-evoked EPSCs were plotted against time. The graph shows the changes in the amplitudes of VSI-evoked EPSCs when VSI was stimulated alone (black) and when both VSI and DSI were stimulated in alternating bursts (orange). Imposing DSI bursts between VSI bursts increased the EPSC amplitudes. , There was a significant increase in the amplitudes of VSI-evoked EPSCs when VSI was stimulated in alternation with DSI ( < 0.01 by paired  test,  = 4). The EPSC amplitude during the artificial swim motor pattern was determined by averaging the amplitude of all EPSCs during the motor pattern. , The role of the tonic firing of DSI after the swim. VSI-evoked EPSCs were tested every 30 s. Normalized EPSC amplitudes are plotted before and after a series VSI spike trains (mimicking the swim motor pattern). When VSI was stimulated alone (black), the EPSPs entered the potentiation state after the artificial swim. When VSI was stimulated in alternation with DSI during the artificial swim, the EPSCs still potentiated after the artificial swim bout (orange). Adding tonic DSI spiking (2 Hz, for 60 s) after the artificial swim greatly reduced the magnitude of the postswim potentiation (green). , Repeated bursts of VSI (black) caused an increase in EPSC amplitude. Firing VSI and DSI in an altering swim-like firing pattern (orange) did not significantly affect the percentage increase in EPSC amplitude. Addition of tonic DSI firing (green) significantly reduced the postswim potentiation. Asterisks indicates a significant difference (,  < 0.05 by paired  test,  = 4; ,  < 0.01 by one-way ANOVA with pairwise multiple comparison by Student\u2013Newman\u2013Keuls method).When VSI was stimulated alone in a repeated bursting pattern, mimicking its firing during a swim motor pattern, the EPSCs that it evoked exhibited short term facilitation and depression (Fig. 9, black plot). Immediately after the VSI spike trains, the EPSCs evoked by test VSI spikes were depressed. Over the course of 2 min, those EPSCs increased in amplitude until they reached a potentiated level that was stable for >10 min (Fig. 9, black plot), similar to when VSI was stimulated to fire a single 5 Hz, 15 s train (compare Fig. 1).When DSI was stimulated in alternation with VSI bursts, as would occur during a swim motor pattern, the VSI-evoked EPSC amplitudes increased, presumably because of the DSI transient enhancement (Fig. 9, orange plot). The average EPSC amplitude during the artificial swim showed a significant increase when DSI bursts were imposed (Fig. 9). After the artificial swim bout, VSI continued to exhibit a prolonged period of synaptic potentiation that was not significantly different from when VSI was stimulated alone (Figs. 9,, orange). Thus, DSI firing during the swim caused short-term enhancement of VSI synaptic strength but did not affect the potentiation after the swim.However, when DSI tonic firing was added after an artificial swim motor pattern (2 Hz for 1 min, from 35 to 95 s after the end of the swim pattern), it significantly reduced the magnitude of the following long-lasting potentiation (Fig. 9,, green). Thus, the tonic DSI firing that occurs after the swim motor pattern might help reset VSI synaptic strength by depotentiating the EPSCs from the potentiated state that is induced by the swim motor pattern. The long integration time of the depotentiation allows low frequency DSI firing to be effective without also causing short term enhancement.In this study, we found that a serotonergic neuron (DSI) evokes distinct state-dependent and state-independent neuromodulatory actions on the strength of synapses made by another neuron (VSI). As a result, the net effect of the serotonergic neuron is dependent on its firing frequency, its burst duration, the timing of its spikes with respect to those of the neuron being modulated, and the state of the synapse being modulated (summarized in Fig. 10). The differences in state- and time-dependency allow the two heterosynaptic actions to play different roles at different stages in the production of a behavior.Schematic diagram showing state-, timing-, and pattern-dependent neuromodulation of the strength of the VSI-VFN synapse by a DSI spike train. In  and , a VSI spike train (top trace), the synaptic strength (middle trace), and DSI spike trains (bottom trace) evoked at three different times are shown. A VSI spike train produces frequency facilitation and a subsequent long-lasting potentiation of synaptic strength (Pot.). Changes in synaptic strength caused by a DSI spike train are indicated by dashed lines. , When the strength of VSI-VFN synapse is in basal state, a DSI spike train () at high frequency (e.g., 5 s, 10 Hz) produces only a transient enhancement (TE). In contrast, when a DSI spike train is imposed during the potentiated state (), it both causes a transient enhancement and depotentiates (De-pot.) the synapse. When a DSI spike train is imposed after a VSI spike train but before the induction of the potentiated state (), it partially reduces the amplitude of the after-potentiated state, depending on the timing of the DSI spike train. , When a DSI is stimulated at a lower frequency for a longer duration, producing the same number of spikes (), it produces a very weak synaptic enhancement, but still evokes a strong depotentiation when the synapse is in the potentiated state () or even in the beginning of the potentiated state () (compare Fig. 9).The state of a synapse can be determined by intrinsic or homosynaptic plasticity, which is dependent on the presynaptic neuron's own firing history. In this study, we found that the synapse from VSI to VFN enters a potentiation state after a spike train. This potentiated state was of intermediate term (\u223c10 min) and seemed to involve a presynaptic change in VSI because it interfered with pair-pulse facilitation (another presynaptic mechanism). Thus, it may be similar to post-tetanic potentiation or augmentation studied in various model systems (Zucker and Regehr, 2002). Only when VSI synapses were in a potentiated state did DSI stimulation decrease the amplitude of VSI EPSCs. The extent of the decrease rarely exceeded the extent of the potentiation. In this way, DSI appeared to depotentiate the synapse, resetting it to its basal state. This suggests that the homosynaptic potentiation and the heterosynaptic depotentiation share a common site of action.The ability of neuromodulatory inputs to reset the synaptic strength to a \u201cbasal\u201d state has implications for synaptic release mechanism. It supports a model suggesting that some forms of homosynaptic plasticity are added to a basal state and thus can be taken away, leaving the original state of the synapse. For example, different pools of vesicles have been suggested to underlie different forms of homosynaptic plasticity in  (Jiang and Abrams, 1998). In , neither heterosynaptic depotentiation nor homosynaptic potentiation appeared to affect the basal release of the VSI synapse.Our finding that heterosynaptic neuromodulation can negate the effect of homosynaptic plasticity appears to be unique in the literature. Although there have been studies that described interactions of homo- and hetero-synaptic plasticity (Levy and Steward, 1979; Doy\u00e8re et al., 1997; Chen et al., 2001; Huang et al., 2008), the term \u201cheterosynaptic\u201d in these studies was taken to mean multiple synapses of the same type rather than neuromodulatory input as in this study. Resetting or depotentiation through low frequency homosynaptic mechanisms has been studied extensively in hippocampal slice preparations (Kulla et al., 1999; Chen et al., 2001; Huang and Hsu, 2001; Huang et al., 2001; Manahan-Vaughan and Kulla, 2003). But to our knowledge, there have been no reports of neuromodulatory actions resetting homosynaptic plasticity.There are however, studies describing neuromodulatory effects on the induction of homosynaptic plasticity, in which the threshold and the magnitude of the synaptic plasticity is altered by neuromodulatory input (Qian and Delaney, 1997; Bristol et al., 2001; Koh and Weiss, 2005; Froemke et al., 2007; Giocomo and Hasselmo, 2007; Seol et al., 2007). Such \u201cmetaplasticity\u201d has been considered as important for determining the threshold for induction of LTP and LTD (Abraham and Bear, 1996; Philpot et al., 1999, 2007; Abraham et al., 2001). Homosynaptic depotentiation also exhibits metaplasticity in that neuromodulatory substances have been shown to change the spike rate threshold for depotentiation (Huang et al., 1999, 2002; Kulla and Manahan-Vaughan, 2002, 2008; Zho et al., 2002; Manahan-Vaughan and Kulla, 2003).It is tempting to speculate about the potential importance of a heterosynaptic reset mechanism for systems that exhibit activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. State-dependent neuromodulatory actions have been reported in a number of systems (Cai et al., 2002; Gu and Yan, 2004). In , the one of the effects of serotonin is dependent on whether the sensory to motor synapse is in a depressed state or not (Byrne and Kandel, 1996). This may play a role at the behavioral level in distinguishing dishabituation from sensitization (Goldsmith and Abrams, 1991). Resetting synapses to a basal state could potentially play a role in rapidly clearing working memory (Mongillo et al., 2008).In contrast to synaptic depotentiation, the ability of DSI to enhance VSI synaptic strength is independent of the state of the synapse. Regardless of whether the synapse was in the basal state or in the potentiated state, DSI stimulation produced approximately a 60% increase in the EPSC amplitude (Fig. 5). This suggests that the transient enhancement acts as a multiplicative scaling factor on the current output state of the synapse. This is consistent with our previous results, which showed that DSI enhanced VSI synaptic strength to an equivalent degree even when the amount of transmitter release was increased by spike broadening (Sakurai et al., 2006). The value of the scaling factor exhibited a great deal of variability within and between preparations, ranging from a 30% increase to a 120% increase (see Fig. 5). The source of that variability is not known. However, it is clear that it does not correlate with the potentiation state of the synapse.The mechanism for the transient enhancement appears to be distinct from the mechanism for the activity-dependent, intrinsic potentiation at this synapse. We previously showed that the DSI-evoked transient enhancement is caused by an increase in the fraction of the readily releasable pool of neurotransmitter (Sakurai et al., 2007). Although in this study, we found that the transient enhancement is independent of the potentiation state, it is still dependent on the release state of the synapse; depleting the size of the readily releasable pool impairs the ability of 5-HT to increase release (Sakurai et al., 2007).In other systems, it has been suggested that an increased fraction of release plays major roles in some forms of homosynaptic potentiation (Zucker and Regher, 2002). If that is the case in VSI, then there would likely be two separate pathways for increasing the fraction of release. In some systems the recruitment of release sites and/or increased pool size are suggested to be at least partly involved in synaptic potentiation (Byrne and Kandel, 1996; Atwood and Wojtowicz, 1999; Rosenmund et al., 2002; Poncer, 2003; Reid et al., 2004; Zhao and Klein, 2004; Habets and Borst, 2007), and these mechanisms may also play a role in VSI homosynaptic potentiation. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of these two types of synaptic enhancement.Previously, we described DSI modulation of VSI synaptic strength as spike timing-dependent in which the timing of the VSI spikes with respect to DSI determines the polarity of the DSI action; when VSI is stimulated within 15 s of a DSI spike train, its synaptic output is enhanced, whereas it is diminished when VSI is stimulated at longer latencies (up to 2 min) (Sakurai and Katz, 2003). However, those studies did not take into account the firing history of VSI and therefore the potentiation state of its synapse. Having now found that VSI exhibits homosynaptic plasticity that changes the state of its synaptic output, we recognize that what we previously described as DSI-evoked synaptic decrease is really depotentiation from a potentiated state. When the VSI synapse is not in a potentiated state, DSI stimulation does not decrease VSI synaptic strength.We infer from our data that the timing dependencies of the neuromodulatory actions arise from the time courses of independent intracellular signaling mechanisms induced by the DSI input and the VSI spike train. The synaptic enhancement produced by a DSI spike train lasts no longer than 15 s. This has consequences for the time duration over which the DSI-evoked enhancement can summate; DSI spikes spread out over a longer time period are less effective at enhancing VSI synaptic strength than a brief train with an equal number of spikes (Fig. 8). Conversely, because the depotentiation is a negation of an altered state, it can integrate over longer periods of time; each DSI spike subtracting from the current state until the baseline is reached (Fig. 8).The DSI-evoked synaptic depotentiation has its own timing dependence; there is a window of time after a VSI spike train and before the onset of the potentiation state, when DSI spiking neither prevents the potentiation nor diminishes it. This timing-sensitivity presumably arises from the intracellular processes after a VSI spike train that lead to the potentiated state; DSI cannot depotentiate the synapse until the potentiation state is achieved.It has been shown in many studies that short-term synaptic plasticity plays crucial roles in configuration of neural networks for motor pattern generation (Katz and Frost, 1995; Calabrese, 1998; Katz, 1999; Sanchez and Kirk, 2000; Sakurai and Katz, 2003; Koh and Weiss, 2005; Giocomo and Hasselmo, 2007; Briggman and Kristan, 2008; Huang et al., 2008), and sensory processing (Nagai et al., 1996; Mercer, 1999; Billimoria et al., 2006; Schneggenburger and Forsythe, 2006). Previously, we suggested that the DSI transient enhancement of VSI synaptic strength serves to boost the synaptic output during the swim motor program, whereas the synaptic decrement would suppress spurious synaptic inputs made by VSI after the cessation of swimming (Sakurai and Katz, 2003). In this study, we found that repeated VSI bursts by themselves can produce a significant potentiation of VSI synapse, which would keep VSI synapses in a potentiated state for >10 min after a swim motor pattern. We further found that DSI firing during the swim motor pattern would not suppress this potentiation, whereas mimicking the tonic DSI firing that occurs after a swim motor pattern suppresses the potentiation and resets the synapse to its basal state. This is likely to have important behavioral consequences for the animal. It has been shown that VSI spiking inhibits crawling after a swim (Popescu and Frost, 2002). Thus, depotentiating these synapses after the swim would make them less effective at inhibiting crawling. In this way, the different actions of a serotonergic neuron have different functions at different stages in the production of the behavior.More generally, our results demonstrate that neuromodulatory actions of neurons can have state, timing, and pattern dependencies. It is not possible to predict the effect of the neuromodulatory neuron without knowing when it is firing with respect to the neuron that it modulates and what the pattern of activity is. In the case of state-dependent neuromodulatory actions, predicting the effect of the neuromodulatory neuron would also require knowing the state of the neuron or synapse being modulated. Similar contingent actions of neuromodulatory neurons are likely to play important roles in controlling the dynamics of any neuronal circuit that receives phasic neuromodulatory input.This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant R21 MH76753.Thank you for sharing this Journal of Neuroscience article.NOTE: We request your email address only to inform the recipient that it was you who recommended this article, and that it is not junk mail.

This study reports a receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), termed VEGF-1 (Flt-1), subserves microglial chemotactic responses induced by A\u03b21\u201342 stimulation,  and . Expression of Flt-1 was significantly increased in tissue obtained from AD patients [compared with tissue from nondemented (ND) individuals], in A\u03b21\u201342-injected rat hippocampus, and in peptide-stimulated human microglia. Single and double immunohistochemical staining demonstrated marked immunoreactivity, for both Flt-1 and its ligand VEGF, in association with microglia and A\u03b2 deposits in AD, but not ND, brain tissue. Functionally, treatment with anti-Flt-1 antibody was highly effective in inhibiting microglial mobility and chemotactic responses measured  using a transwell migration assay. , transplanted enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-labeled microglia exhibited Flt-1-dependent chemotaxis induced by peptide injection with anti-Flt-1 effective in blocking migration of cells. Importantly, anti-Flt-1 reduction of microglial mobility was neuroprotective in peptide-injected hippocampus and associated with a significant increase in numbers of viable hippocampal neurons. The results of this study suggest critical functional roles for Flt-1 in mediating microglial chemotactic inflammatory responses which contribute to pathological conditions in AD brain.The Flt-1 subtype of VEGF receptor has been reported as a signaling factor in mediating chemotactic responses of immune responding cells (Barleon et al., 1996; Forstreuter et al., 2002). In addition, the results from several studies have indicated that Flt-1-mediated signaling could contribute to pathological conditions in disease (Sk\u00f6ld et al., 2005). Elevated VEGF expression has been documented in asthma (Hoshino et al., 2001) and eosinophil inflammatory responses are dependent on activation of Flt-1 (Feistritzer et al., 2004). In a model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), blockade of Flt-1 was effective in reducing symptoms of disease, whereas inhibition of the Flk-1 subtype of VEGF receptor was without effect (De Bandt et al., 2003). Recently, a number of pathological inflammatory responses have been found to be attenuated in Flt-1-deficient mice compared with their wild-type cohorts in a murine model of RA (Murakami et al., 2006). It was concluded that enhanced inflammation in RA was mediated by Flt-1-dependent signaling in activated monocytes/macrophages.At present, functional roles for Flt-1 in neurodegenerative brain disease have not been addressed. Deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) is considered a critical inducer of inflammatory responses and neuronal damage in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain (Combs et al., 2001; Hardy and Selkoe, 2002; Spires et al., 2005). We have reported that intrahippocampal injection of full-length peptide (A\u03b21\u201342) increased inflammatory reactivity including mobility of resident brain microglia and also caused perturbed vasculature including leakiness of blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) (Ryu and McLarnon, 2006). Furthermore, separate  experiments have shown increased expression of VEGF, neovascularization, and neurodegeneration in inflamed rat brain with double-staining analysis indicating VEGF was primarily associated with microglia (Tran et al., 2005). These data would be consistent with microglia acting both as a source (paracrine signal) and as a responder (autocrine signal via Flt-1) to VEGF.Overall, our findings suggested the possibility that Flt-1 and VEGF-dependent mobilization of microglia and cellular chemotactic responses could serve critical response functions in AD brain. To test this premise we have used three independent approaches: analysis of Flt-1 in both brain tissue and in microglia obtained from AD patients [with control brain sections and microglia from nondemented (ND) individuals] and following intrahippocampal injection of A\u03b21\u201342 (controls, saline and reverse peptide). In the latter experiments we report the first  effects of pharmacological modulation of Flt-1 (using anti-Flt-1 antibody) to inhibit microglial chemotactic responses to peptide. Our findings also suggest block of microglial chemotaxis as a novel strategy for neuroprotection in AD brain.Entorhinal cortical sections from six ND cases (ages from 40 to 85 years, postmortem intervals, 4\u201324 h) and seven AD cases (ages from 67 to 87 years, postmortem intervals, 5\u201310 h) were obtained from the Kinsmen Laboratory brain bank at the University of British Columbia (UBC, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). All cases of AD met the clinical criteria and postmortem confirmation for AD. The procedures used to isolate postmortem tissue have been described (Miklossy et al., 2007).For single immunofluorescent staining of Flt-1 and VEGF (Arai et al., 2006), free-floating sections (30 \u03bcm) from ND and AD tissues were washed in PBS with Triton X-100 (PBST; 0.01 m PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.3% Triton X-100) and transferred into 5% skim milk in PBST for 1 h. Sections were then incubated for 48 h at 4\u00b0C with rabbit anti-human vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (Flt-1, 1:200; R&D Systems) or rabbit anti-VEGF (a marker for the potent angiogenic factor VEGF, 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody. Sections were then rinsed in PBST and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing in PBST, sections were mounted on glass slides and coverslipped with Prolong Gold anti-fading agent (Invitrogen).For double-immunofluorescence staining (Guo et al., 2006), free-floating sections were incubated for 48 h at 4\u00b0C with a mixture of two primary antibodies: rabbit anti-Flt-1 (1:100; R&D Systems) in combination with mouse anti-HLA-DR (a marker for microglia, 1:500; DakoCytomation) or mouse anti-\u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2, clone 6F/3D, 1:100; DakoCytomation) and rabbit anti-VEGF (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in combination with mouse anti-HLA-DR or mouse anti-\u03b2-amyloid. For A\u03b2 staining, 100% formic acid (Sigma) pretreatment for 15 min at room temperature was performed before primary antibody incubation (Guo et al., 2006). After incubation with the indicated primary antibodies, sections were rinsed in PBST and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a mixture of Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Invitrogen) and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:200; Invitrogen). To block endogenous lipofuscin autofluorescence, Sudan black (1% w/v) was prepared in 70% methanol and immunostained brain sections were stained with the compound for 10 min as previously described (Guo et al., 2006; Hashemzadeh-Bonehi et al., 2006). Typical Sudan black staining is presented (see supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material): also see supplemental text for details of immunostaining controls and immunohistochemical analysis for human tissue.Cultured adult human ND and AD microglia were used in several experiments. Following isolation of brains, tissue was enzymatically dissociated and microglia were harvested and placed under culture conditions following standard protocols (Walker et al., 1995; Lue et al., 1996; McLarnon et al., 2005). Microglia were separated from other glial cells by differential adherence and maintained in DMEM with high glucose (5 mg/ml) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and 50 \u03bcg/ml gentamicin. Microglia were used in experiments, after 10\u201314 d in culture, following previously described procedures (McLarnon et al., 2006). The typical morphological appearance of HLA-DR(+) microglia obtained from AD patients, with swollen cell bodies and retracted processes, has been shown [see McLarnon et al. (2006), their Fig. 2]. ND microglia in culture exhibit a predominant ramified morphology with cells expressing extended processes (not shown). These representative patterns of AD and ND morphology remained constant throughout culture times. Cell purity was assessed using immunocytochemistry with antibodies to CD11b [American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)] to class II major histocompatibility antigen (HLA-DR) (1:800; CN Pharmaceuticals) and to CD68 (1:1000; Accurate Chemical and Scientific). Immunocytochemical results showed purity of microglia was in excess of 98%.All animal procedures were approved by the UBC Animal Care Ethics Committee, with adherence to guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 280\u2013300 g (Charles River Laboratories) were used for stereotaxic injection of A\u03b21\u201342, or controls (PBS and reverse peptide A\u03b242\u20131) as previously described (Franciosi et al., 2006; Ryu and McLarnon, 2008). In brief, animals received intraperitoneal injection of an anesthetic mixture (ketamine 100 mg/kg and xylazine 10 mg/kg) and were placed in a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf Instruments). Beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) peptide (2 nmol; California Peptides) was slowly injected (0.2 \u03bcl/min) into the dentate gyrus [anteroposterior (AP), \u22123.3 mm; mediolateral (ML), \u22121.6 mm; dorsoventral (DV), \u22123.2 mm] or CA1 layer (AP, \u22123.3 mm; ML, \u22121.8 mm; DV, \u22122.6 mm) of hippocampus.Animals were transcardially perfused with heparinized cold saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. Brains were then removed, postfixed, cryoprotected, and cut into 40 \u03bcm sections (Ryu and McLarnon, 2008). Free-floating sections were processed for immunohistochemistry as described previously (Franciosi et al., 2006; Ryu and McLarnon, 2008). Briefly, sections were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100, blocked with 10% NGS, and incubated for 48 h at 4\u00b0C with the primary antibodies: anti-Flt-1 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-neuronal nuclei (NeuN, a marker for neurons, 1:1000; Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents), and anti-ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1, a marker for microglia, 1:500; Wako Chemicals). Sections were rinsed in PBS with 0.5% BSA and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 (1:200; Invitrogen) for 1 h in the dark.To detect the Flt-1-expressing cell types in A\u03b2-injected hippocampus, tissue sections were incubated for 48 h at 4\u00b0C with anti-Flt-1, in combination with anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, a marker for astrocytes, 1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich) or anti-CR3R (OX-42, a marker for microglia/macrophages, 1:500; Serotec) as described previously (Choi et al., 2007). Sections were washed and incubated with a mixture of secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 and 594; 1:100; Invitrogen). Since Iba-1 antibody is raised in rabbit it was not suitable for double staining of microgliosis with either Flt-1 Ab or VEGF Ab. Thus OX-42 (raised in mouse) was used in double staining with Flt-1 and VEGF.Quantification of immunohistochemical staining was performed on digitized images obtained with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescent microscope at a magnification of 400\u00d7 equipped with DVC camera (Diagnostic Instruments) and Northern Eclipse software (Empix Imaging). Quantitative image analysis for the immunostained rat hippocampal sections was performed on three equally spaced sections through the level of the injection site (AP: \u22123.3 mm). The number of Flt-1 or OX-42/GFAP+Flt-1(+) cells in the superior blade of the dentate granule cell layer was determined for three sections (Franciosi et al., 2006; Ryu and McLarnon, 2008). The number of Iba-1 or NeuN(+) cells in the CA1 region was quantified at three hippocampal sections. To keep the consistency between the selected sections, a rectangular box (0.4 \u00d7 0.3 mm) was centered over the CA1 cell layer beginning 1.6 mm lateral to the midline in each image as previously described (Casolini et al., 2007). For quantification of migrating enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing microglia after transplantation, the number of EGFP(+) microglia were counted within rectangular areas (0.3 \u00d7 0.2 mm) for three different regions (centered 600, 1200, and 1800 \u03bcm away from the transplantation site). All quantitative analyses were performed in a blinded manner.Adult human microglia were prepared from frontal neocortex of ND and AD brains (Walker et al., 2006). In one set of RT-PCR experiments, expression of Flt-1 and VEGF in microglia from ND and AD brains were examined. In another set of experiments, human microglia from ND samples were plated on 12 well multiplates and incubated in serum-free medium for 48 h (McLarnon et al., 2006; Ryu and McLarnon, 2008) before treatment with PBS or A\u03b21\u201342 (8 h exposure to 5 \u03bcm peptide). Our use of RT-PCR followed published protocols (McLarnon et al., 2006; Choi et al., 2007) using specific primers for human Flt-1, VEGF, and GAPDH (see the supplemental text for the primer sequences). A PCR cycle number of 35 was chosen for analysis of product levels on the basis that at this cycle number, densitometric signal was within the amplification phase of PCR (see representative graph in supplemental Fig. 3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Analysis of PCR cycle versus band intensity indicated plateau regions of plots to occur in excess of 40 PCR cycles. Previous studies have indicated 35 cycles of PCR as suitable for amplification of cDNA for a host of inflammatory factors expressed in activated microglia (Choi et al., 2007; Ryu and McLarnon, 2008).RT-PCR in peptide-injected rat hippocampus. Anesthetized animals were killed by decapitation at 1, 3, and 7 d after peptide injection. The control animals were killed at 7 d after PBS or reverse peptide A\u03b242\u20131 injection. Brains were removed and hippocampal tissues were freshly dissected onto cold metal tissue matrices (Harvard Apparatus) and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. RT-PCR was performed using rat Flt-1 and \u03b2-actin primers as described previously (Ryu and McLarnon, 2008). The sequences and expected product sizes of the PCR primers are shown in the supplemental text.Detailed procedures for use of Western blot analysis (Ryu et al., 2006) are contained in supplemental text.Experiments were performed using APP23 transgenic mice (Sturchler-Pierrat et al., 1997). These animals carry the human APP751 cDNA with the Swedish double mutation under control of the murine Thy-1.2 promoter. APP23 animals were 9 months of age. Littermates of APP23 mice carrying no human Swedish mutant APP751 cDNA were used as wild-type (WT) controls. These studies measured Flt-1 and VEGF expression in APP23 and WT mice. Preparation of sections followed the same protocols as for rat brain sections. Free-floating sections were processed for double-immunofluorescence staining for Flt-1/A\u03b2 and VEGF/A\u03b2.Fibrillar A\u03b21\u201342 and reverse peptide A\u03b21\u201342 (California Peptides) were first dissolved in 35% acetonitrile (Sigma) and further diluted to 500 \u03bcm with incremental additions of PBS with vortexing. The peptide solution was subsequently incubated at 37\u00b0C for 18 h to promote fibrilization and aggregation and stored at \u221220\u00b0C (Lue et al., 2001; Franciosi et al., 2006). We also performed immunohistochemical staining (Thioflavin-S staining and A\u03b2 immunostaining) to examine the aggregation state of A\u03b2 peptide . The results show that aggregated A\u03b2 peptide was labeled with Thioflavin-S and A\u03b2 antibody at 7 d after injection (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).For the inhibition of Flt-1, the neutralizing monoclonal antibody against Flt-1 (R&D Systems) was coadministered at 10 \u03bcg with peptides into CA1 layer. Control animals were injected with control antibody rat IgG. The dose and treatment protocol for anti-Flt-1 Ab in this study have been previously reported to be effective in inhibition of Flt-1-mediated cellular responses (Feistritzer et al., 2004; Ambati et al., 2006).An EGFP-lentivirus construct was generated by transfecting HEK 293T cells with three plasmids: the transfer plasmid pHR'-CMV-EGFP, the packaging plasmid PR8\u20132, and the envelop plasmid PVSVG, as described previously (Skarsgard et al., 2005). Lentiviral particles containing media were collected over 4 d and centrifuged at 27,500 rpm for 3 h to concentrate. A titer of 6.36 \u00d7 108 transducing units (TU)/ml was assayed by measuring serial dilutions of the concentrated virus on primary rat cultured cells. Lentiviral vectors were used to infect primary fetal microglia cultures.Rat cultured microglia were prepared from embryonic day 14 Sprague Dawley rats, as described previously (Yang et al., 2006). Three days after lentiviral infection (with threefold higher titers of lentivirus than the seeded microglial cell density), immunostaining of EGFP-labeled microglia were performed with a mixture of primary antibodies: anti-Iba-1 (1:1000; Wako) and anti-EGFP, (1:200; Invitrogen). Cells were then incubated with appropriate Alexa-labeled secondary antibodies (Invitrogen), followed by DAPI staining.Rat microglial cultures, prelabeled with EGFP transfection, were incubated with anti-Flt-1 Ab or control Ab (10 \u03bcg, R&D Systems) for 30 min before transplantation. Cells (2 \u03bcl, 1 \u00d7 105 cells per \u03bcl) were transplanted (at 0.5 \u03bcl/min) under anesthesia (Ryu et al., 2004), 3 d after A\u03b21\u201342 injection (2 nmol, CA1) into the medial corpus callosum at the following coordinates (AP, \u22123.3; ML, 0.0; DV, \u22122.8). Animals were perfused at 7 d after cell transplantation and double immunohistochemical procedures were performed as follows. Sections were incubated with primary Ab: anti-EGFP (1:500, Invitrogen) or anti-EGFP in combination with anti-VEGF (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-Flt-1 (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).The migration of human microglia  was determined using Transwell inserts (pore size, 8 \u03bcm, BD Biosciences Discovery) and 24-well culture plates (Corning Costar) as previously described (Aarum et al., 2003). Cell-free conditioned medium was collected from microglial cultures stimulated with PBS, A\u03b21\u201342 (5 \u03bcm), or A\u03b242\u20131 (5 \u03bcm) for 24 h and placed in a lower chamber. Human microglia were placed in an upper chamber in serum-free medium and treated (1 h at 37\u00b0C) with anti-Flt-1 neutralizing antibody or control IgG (10 \u03bcg/ml, R&D Systems). The transwell plates were incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. Human microglial migration was quantified by counting the number of cells that migrated through the membrane to the lower chamber using an inverted bright-field microscope (five fields/each well).Results are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. The statistical analysis was performed using a one-way ANOVA, followed by the Student\u2013Newman\u2013Keuls multiple comparison test or Student's  test (GraphPad Prism 3.0; Graph Pad) with the significance level set at  < 0.05.An initial aspect of this work was the characterization of expressions of Flt-1, and its ligand VEGF, in microglia and in brain sections obtained from ND and AD individuals. Human microglia obtained from ND and AD tissues were initially analyzed for levels of Flt-1 and VEGF. Representative RT-PCR showed little or no expression of either receptor or ligand in human ND microglia (Fig. 1), however, AD microglia demonstrated markedly increased levels of both factors. Semiquantification of data are shown in Figure 1. In total ( = 8 ND cases,  = 6 AD cases), Flt-1 was increased 3.2-fold and VEGF was increased 8.2-fold in AD, compared with ND, human microglia.Expression of Flt-1 and VEGF in human ND/AD microglia and in ND/AD tissue. , Typical RT-PCR for Flt-1 and VEGF expressions in microglia obtained from ND and AD brain tissue.

As shown in Figure 1, low levels of Flt-1 and VEGF were evident in PBS control with a marked increase for both ligand and receptor induced by peptide stimulation (5 \u03bcm for 8 h). Semiquantitative analysis is presented in Figure 1 with overall ( = 4 independent samples/group) mRNA levels increased by 3.3-fold (for Flt-1) and by 9-fold (for VEGF) with peptide, compared with control, treatment.We next investigated for association between the VEGF receptor and VEGF itself with microgliosis in ND and AD sections. Representative immunohistochemical staining showed minimal levels of either Flt-1 (Fig. 1) or VEGF (Fig. 1) in ND sections. However, both receptor (Fig. 1) and ligand (Fig. 1) were highly expressed in AD brain sections.Representative double staining for HLA-DR(+) microglia with Flt-1 and VEGF are presented (Fig. 1,, respectively), for ND and AD tissue. Both Flt-1 and VEGF showed little merged staining with microglia in ND sections. However, AD brain tissue demonstrated marked levels of association of Flt-1/HLA-DR (Fig. 1) and VEGF/HLA-DR (Fig. 1).Single-staining analysis was used to quantify levels of Flt-1 and VEGF and double staining to quantify association of these factors with microglia ( = 6 ND cases, 7 AD cases). The area density of Flt-1 ir was significantly increased by 6.4-fold in AD, relative to ND, tissue (Fig. 1, lower left graph). A similar magnitude of increase (by 5.6-fold) was measured for the number of microglia expressing Flt-1 (Fig. 1, lower right graph) in AD versus ND tissue. The area density of VEGF was increased eightfold in AD, compared with ND, brain tissue (Fig. 1, lower left graph). The corresponding increase in the number of microglia associated with VEGF was 6.2-fold in AD versus ND sections (Fig. 1, lower right graph).A relevant question was the possible association of Flt-1 and VEGF with peptide deposition. This point was addressed using immunohistochemical staining to determine localization of receptor and ligand with A\u03b2 in AD brain sections. Representative staining patterns for Flt-1 (upper left panel), VEGF (lower left panel), and A\u03b2 (middle panels) in AD tissue are presented in Figure 2 The corresponding double-staining immunoreactivities for Flt-1/A\u03b2 and VEGF/A\u03b2 are also shown in Figure 2 (right panels). Although quantification of double staining was not done, clearly defined areas of Flt-1 and VEGF ir colocalized to peptide were evident. The patterns of staining also showed regions of Flt-1 and VEGF ir which were not associated with peptide deposits.Association of Flt-1 and VEGF with \u03b2-amyloid peptide in AD tissue. The upper panels show representative images of Flt-1 and A\u03b2 ir (left and middle panels) and merged staining of Flt-1/A\u03b2 (right panel) in AD brain tissue. The lower panels show representative results for staining of VEGF with A\u03b2. Scale bar: 50 \u03bcm.The findings of association between Flt-1 and VEGF with A\u03b2 deposits in human AD tissue sections (Fig. 2) led us to investigate expression of these factors in APP transgenic mice. These experiments used cortical tissue from transgenic APP23 mice and WT controls (see Materials and Methods). Double immunohistochemical staining was performed on Flt-1 and VEGF with peptide. Representative patterns of double staining are presented in Figure 3 for Flt-1/A\u03b2 and in Figure 3 for VEGF/A\u03b2 for WT controls (upper panels) and APP23 mice (lower panels). The staining results indicate enhanced expression of both Flt-1 and VEGF in transgenic animals compared with the WT mice. The double-staining panels show representative examples of Flt-1 and VEGF ir in proximity to A\u03b2 deposits in the cortex of APP23 mice compared with WT controls. Although we did not quantify extents of changes in expression of Flt-1 and VEGF, or their association with A\u03b2, between transgenic and WT animals, the patterns of marker ir were consistent with results obtained from analysis of human tissue.Staining of Flt-1, VEGF, and A\u03b2 in wild-type (WT) and transgenic mice. , The upper panels show typical Flt-1 and A\u03b2 ir and merged staining in WT mice.

Scale bar represents 50 \u03bcm.We initially used RT-PCR to determine time-dependent changes in VEGF receptor-1 (Flt-1) expression following intrahippocampal injection of A\u03b21\u201342. Representative results indicated controls (7 d injections with PBS or A\u03b242\u20131) to exhibit minimal levels of the VEGF receptor-1 (Fig. 4). However, A\u03b21\u201342 injection was associated with elevated Flt-1, relative to controls, at 1 and 3 d after peptide with a further increase at a duration of 7 d. Semiquantitative RT-PCR is presented in the bar graph of Figure 4 ( = 5 animals/group). Expression of Flt-1 was significantly higher (by 3-fold at 1 d and 2.6-fold at 3 d) for peptide versus PBS control (7 d) injections. The corresponding increase for the longest duration of A\u03b21\u201342 injection (7 d) was a 4.5-fold increase in Flt-1 with peptide compared with PBS.Time dependency of Flt-1 expression and production in A\u03b21\u201342-injected rat hippocampus. , Representative Flt-1 mRNA expression following hippocampal injections with controls [PBS and A\u03b242\u20131 (7 d)] and A\u03b21\u201342 (1, 3, and 7 d). \u03b2-actin was used as a reaction standard.

Scale bar: 50 \u03bcm. The bar graph shows number of Flt-1(+) cells for PBS and A\u03b242\u20131 controls (7 d) and the time dependence of Flt-1 expression for the different times of peptide injections ( = 6 animals/group). * < 0.05 versus PBS.We also performed Western blot analysis to determine levels of Flt-1 protein following peptide injection (at 1, 3, and 7 d). Representative immunoblots are presented for Flt-1 in Figure 4 with data quantification shown in the accompanying bar graph. Levels of protein production in A\u03b21\u201342-injected hippocampus ( = 4 animals/group) were significantly increased by 46% relative to control PBS injection (7 d after injection).We also used immunohistochemical staining to examine changes in Flt-1 with duration of peptide injection (1\u20137 d). Representative staining for controls (7 d injections of either PBS or A\u03b242\u20131) demonstrated little or no immunoreactivity (ir) for Flt-1 (Fig. 4). However, A\u03b21\u201342 injection caused a progressive time-dependent increase in numbers of Flt-1(+) cells (Fig. 4). Overall ( = 6 animals/group), significant increases in Flt-1 were determined at 1, 3, and 7 d after peptide injections (by 4-fold, 12-fold, and 30-fold, respectively, relative to PBS 7 d injection) (Fig. 4, lower right bar graph). These results are consistent with RT-PCR data with the exception that immunostaining analysis showed progressive increases in Flt-1 at early times after peptide injection.We next used double staining to examine the specific cells expressing Flt-1. These experiments were performed at a single time point of 7 d after A\u03b21\u201342 injection and used GFAP and OX-42 as respective cell-specific markers for astrocytes and microglia. The results (Fig. 5, left panels) showed low levels of GFAP/Flt-1 double staining in PBS control with an elevated astrocyte expression of Flt-1 marker in peptide-injected brain. Low levels of merged OX-42/Flt-1 staining were evident in PBS control (Fig. 5, upper right panel). However, peptide-injected hippocampus demonstrated a considerable proportion of microglia in association with Flt-1 (Fig. 5, lower right panel). Quantification of data are presented in the right bar graph of Figure 5 ( = 6 animals/group). Relatively low values of Flt-1 associated GFAP(+) astrocytes or OX-42(+) microglia were evident in PBS control. However, following A\u03b21\u201342 injection GFAP/Flt-1 ir was increased by 6.2-fold and OX-42/Flt-1 ir was increased by 15.5-fold, relative to controls. Both increases were significant, however, association of Flt-1 was significantly higher with microglia compared with astrocytes.Flt-1 double staining with microglia and astrocytes. , Upper panels show representative Flt-1 double staining with astrocytes (GFAP marker) and microglia (OX-42 marker) following 7 d injection of PBS.

These experiments used an anti-Flt-1 neutralizing antibody (anti-Flt-1 Ab) in conjunction with Iba-1 (microglial marker) and NeuN (neuronal marker) in A\u03b21\u201342-injected (7 d) rat brain. Nonimmune rat IgG Ab was used as an antibody control in peptide-injected brain.Representative microglial ir for the different treatments are presented in Figure 6. Relatively low levels of Iba-1 staining (Fig. 6, upper panels) were observed in controls (7 d injections of PBS or A\u03b242\u20131). However, the A\u03b21\u201342-injected hippocampus demonstrated a diffuse and high level of Iba-1 staining which was reduced in the presence of anti-Flt-1 Ab with peptide (Fig. 6, lower panels). Overall ( = 6 animals/group), the number of Iba-1(+) microglia was increased fivefold in A\u03b21\u201342, compared with PBS-injected animals (Fig. 6). Treatment with anti-Flt-1 Ab significantly reduced microgliosis (by 26%) compared with A\u03b21\u201342 injection alone.Effects of anti-Flt-1 antibody on Iba-1 (microglial marker) and NeuN expression . , Representative Iba-1 immunoreactivity (ir) following 7 d intrahippocampal injection for the following: PBS, A\u03b242\u20131, A\u03b21\u201342 plus control Ab and A\u03b21\u201342 plus anti-Flt-1 Ab.

The number of NeuN(+) cells was markedly diminished following A\u03b21\u201342 injection (Fig. 6, lower left panel). However, if anti-Flt-1 Ab treatment was applied to peptide-injected animals, numbers of NeuN(+) neurons were increased (Fig. 6, bottom right panel). Overall ( = 6 animals/group), the number of hippocampal neurons was reduced by 37% with A\u03b21\u201342, compared with PBS injection (Fig. 6). Application of anti-Flt-1 Ab was effective in conferring neuroprotection whereby numbers of neurons were significantly increased (by 23%) compared with control Ab injection.The upregulation of Flt-1 in the peptide-injected hippocampus (Fig. 4) and association with OX-42(+) cells (Fig. 5,) could reflect chemotactic responses of microglia. Experiments were designed to examine this possibility  and . A schematic diagram (Fig. 7) indicates the method used to measure  migration of human microglia. Microglial cells were initially subjected to 24 h exposure for the following treatments; PBS, A\u03b21\u201342, and reverse peptide A\u03b242\u20131. Supernatants from the treated microglia were then applied to a transwell chamber (lower chamber) for the measurement of migration. Microglia in the upper chamber were preincubated with control Ab or with anti-Flt-1 Ab (10 \u03bcg/ml for 1 h), before the chemotactic assay. The bar graph in Figure 7 summarizes the results from  = 5 experiments. Microglial chemotaxis increased 4.6-fold with A\u03b21\u201342 treatment, relative to PBS control. Inclusion of anti-Flt-1 Ab with A\u03b21\u201342 peptide, significantly diminished microglial mobility by 37% compared with the application of peptide alone. Numbers of migrating microglia were similar for controls and for anti-Flt-1 Ab applied alone.Migration of human microglia, . , Schematic diagram for the treatment of microglia with PBS, A\u03b21\u201342, or A\u03b242\u20131 and supernatant application, in the absence and presence of anti-Flt-1 Ab, in the transwell microglial migration assay. , The bar graph shows the number of migrating microglia with the different treatments and the effects of anti-Flt-1 Ab on migration ( = 5 samples/group). * < 0.05 for peptide versus PBS treatment; # < 0.05 for effects of anti-Flt-1 Ab on migration with peptide application.To examine chemotactic responses , we used the procedures schematically diagrammed in Figure 8 (top panel). Microglia were first isolated from rat brain and then infected with a lentivirus-expressing EGFP. Figure 8 (bottom panels) shows representative  double staining (EGFP and Iba-1) for the cells before injection; colocalization of EGFP with the microglial marker Iba-1 was evident for all cells examined. The EGFP-microglia were incubated with control or anti-Flt-1 Ab (10 \u03bcg/ml for 30 min) and then stereotaxically injected into peptide-injected rat brain (at 3 d after peptide injection) at the location shown (Fig. 8, asterisk). Three areas were designated for the counting of EGFP-microglia (labeled 1\u20133 in Fig. 8), at sites between injected EGFP-microglia and peptide.Chemotactic responses of EGFP-labeled microglia, . , Upper panel, Schematic diagram showing  locations of EGFP-labeled microglial transplantation (*) and A\u03b21\u201342 or reverse peptide injection (red circle).

Scale bar: 20 \u03bcm.The number of EGFP(+) microglia in the different areas were measured in three groups of animals; A\u03b21\u201342 plus microglia incubated with control Ab; A\u03b21\u201342 plus microglia incubated with anti-Flt-1 Ab or reverse peptide A\u03b242\u20131 plus microglia incubated with control Ab. Animals receiving reverse peptide injection (Fig. 8, top panels) showed high levels of EGFP-microglia in area 1 adjacent to transplantation site but minimal migration of cells to area 2 or 3 nearer to peptide. Representative immunostaining showed a different pattern of chemotaxis with A\u03b21\u201342 injection (Fig. 8, middle panels) whereby considerable levels of EGFP(+) microglia were evident in both areas 2 and 3. Animals receiving anti-Flt-1 Ab with peptide (Fig. 8, bottom panels) exhibited similar levels of EGFP ir in area 1 as for the other treatments. However, anti-Flt-1 Ab was effective in decreasing numbers of migrating microglia in areas more proximal to peptide, compared with animals receiving control antibody treatment.The quantification for  chemotaxis of EGFP(+) microglia is presented in Figure 8. Overall ( = 6 animals/group), no differences in numbers of EGFP(+) microglia were measured in area 1 for the different treatments. In area 2, anti-Flt-1 Ab treatment significantly reduced the number of EGFP(+) cells (by 57%) relative to peptide-injection. The corresponding decrease in area 3 was 87%, representing a significant reduction by anti-Flt-1 Ab in the migration of EGFP-labeled microglia induced by peptide stimulation.Double immunostaining of the EGFP-microglia-injected hippocampus was also examined to determine association between injected cells and markers for Flt-1 and VEGF. Representative double staining for EGFP(+) microglia and Flt-1 are shown in the left panels of Figure 8, with merged staining indicating considerable regions of overlap of the markers. Similarly, the association of VEGF with EGFP(+) microglia was also demonstrated (Fig. 8, right panels).Chronic inflammation is integral to AD pathology, however, specific mechanisms underlying inflammatory responses are not well understood (Mrak and Griffin, 2007). A critical and early component of inflammatory response is an increased microglial mobility and chemotactic activity to A\u03b2 peptide deposition in AD brain. Our results suggest that the VEGF receptor subtype Flt-1 serves as a microglial chemotactic receptor to mobilize these immune cells in proximity to peptide deposits yielding localized and amplified inflammatory microenvironments in AD brain. Importantly, such microenvironments may be neurotoxic since we provide evidence that Flt-1-dependent mobilization of microglia is associated with neurodegeneration.The conclusions stated above are supported by the findings that Flt-1 are upregulated under three independent experimental conditions; in AD cortical brain tissue, following intrahippocampal injection of A\u03b21\u201342 in rat brain and after peptide stimulation of human microglia. This work has directly demonstrated involvement of Flt-1 in mediating microglial chemotactic responses  and , in response to peptide stimulation. Importantly, anti-Flt-1 Ab was found effective in inhibiting mobility of EGFP-labeled microglia induced by A\u03b21\u201342 injection into rat hippocampus and attenuating mobility of cultured microglia responding to a transwell insert of peptide. Previous work, using the murine microglial cell line (BV-2), has reported increased cell migration in response to VEGF (Forstreuter et al., 2002). Since VEGF is also a potent factor for induction of neovasculature, the present data also suggest microglial chemokine activity may be associated with vascular remodeling in AD brain, a point discussed below.An important finding was that microglia obtained from AD brain samples exhibited significantly higher expressions and levels of Flt-1 and ligand VEGF relative to ND brain tissue. Double staining showed little or no localization of either Flt-1 or VEGF with HLA-DR(+) microglia in ND sections. A very different result was obtained in AD brain tissue where considerable Flt-1 and VEGF ir was associated with microglia. These data could indicate that in AD, enhanced Flt-1 and VEGF expression contributes to microglial autocrine and paracrine processes. Thus, \u03b2-amyloid peptide not only induces chemotaxis in AD brain but also acts to amplify responses resulting in microgliosis.Our results also demonstrate considerable extents of Flt-1 and VEGF ir colocalized with peptide. Since both factors are associated with microglia (Fig. 1), these data imply clusters of mobile microglial cells in proximity to peptide deposits. The patterns of Flt-1 staining in both AD tissue (Fig. 2) and APP23 transgenic mice (Fig. 3) showed evidence for areas of Flt-1 ir coincident with A\u03b2 peptide deposits in addition to regions with no association between the two markers. It was noteworthy that Flt-1 ir away from deposits appeared discrete, whereas Flt-1 ir in association with plaques exhibited diffuse patterns of staining. This finding was observed in both AD tissue and in transgenic animals. One possible interpretation of these immunostaining data are that a diffuse Flt-1 ir colocalized with A\u03b2 is indicating the accumulation of numbers of microglial cells nearby peptide. In this case the diffuse Flt-1 ir could represent the endpoint of microglial chemotactic responses initiated by deposits of amyloid-\u03b2 peptide. This explanation would be consistent with the expression and activation of Flt-1 in microglia serving as a mechanism to induce cellular mobility and mobilize and accumulate microglia in the vicinity of plaques. Although speculative at present, Flt-1-mediated microglial reactivity and inflammatory responses could then be linked with, and modulated by, the extents of amyloid deposits in AD brain., intrahippocampal injection of A\u03b21\u201342 caused a time-dependent (1\u20137 d) increase in expression of Flt-1 as measured using RT-PCR, Western blots, or immunohistochemical staining (Fig. 4). Double-staining analysis demonstrated a predominant association of Flt-1 with microglia, however, a smaller extent of Flt-1 localization to astrocytes was also evident. At 7 d after peptide injection, significant increases of microgliosis and neuronal damage were measured relative to controls (injection of PBS or reverse peptide, A\u03b242\u20131). A novel finding was that the inclusion of anti-Flt-1 Ab with peptide, inhibited microgliosis and conferred partial neuroprotection. These results suggest blocking peptide-induced microglial migration as a rationale strategy to attenuate neuronal damage in AD brain.To examine functional roles of Flt-1 , EGFP-labeled microglia were transplanted into rat hippocampus previously injected with A\u03b21\u201342 or reverse peptide. Three areas, differentially located between sites of microglial transplantation and peptide injection, were used to quantify microglial mobility. In the presence of reverse peptide, no net migration of EGFP-microglia away from the transplantation site was evident. However, with A\u03b21\u201342 as a chemotactic stimulus, microglia exhibited increased mobility into parenchymal areas directed toward the peptide-injection site. Treatment of peptide-injected brain with anti-Flt-1 Ab was highly effective in reducing the numbers of migrating EGFP-microglia in regions 2 and 3 between sites of microglial transplantation and peptide injection. Double-staining analysis showed considerable extents in overlaps of EGFP microglial marker with both Flt-1 and VEGF.Anti-Flt-1 Ab was also effective in inhibiting the migration of human microglia , where supernatants (conditioned medium) from cells exposed to PBS, A\u03b21\u201342, and A\u03b242\u20131 were used as stimulants. Under control conditions, neither PBS nor reverse peptide were effective in the induction of microglial mobility. With A\u03b21\u201342 as a stimulus, a markedly increased migration was evident (by fourfold) relative to PBS; this enhanced migration was reduced with inclusion of anti-Flt-1 Ab treatment with peptide. However, anti-Flt-1 Ab was only partially effective in the inhibition of microglial chemotactic response. This latter result could reflect that under the experimental conditions of this assay, factors in the conditioned medium, other than VEGF, could also contribute to the increased mobility of microglia. Future studies using Flt-1 knock-out transgenic mice could have utility in characterizing functional roles of this chemotactic receptor in AD brain. However, interpretation of results could be confounded by the possibility that Flt-1 knock-out animals could exhibit deficits in developmental and other functional responses (Fong et al., 1995).The possibility that accumulation of peptide could serve as foci for the induction of microglial-mediated inflammatory paracrine responses involving VEGF is an important consideration in the pathology of AD. Previous work has reported increased intrathecal levels of VEGF in AD, relative to non-AD, individuals (Tarkowski et al., 2002). This study also reported elevated VEGF was correlated with clinical severity of disease. Since VEGF is a highly potent vascular mediator, our results suggest the possibility of vascular remodeling near sites of microgliosis, elevated VEGF and peptide deposits. It has been pointed out that vascular angiogenic factors are elevated in AD pathology (Vagnucci and Li, 2003; Pogue and Lukiw, 2004), however, despite this finding there is little evidence for formation of new blood vessels in AD diagnosed individuals. Instead, vasculature in AD brain exhibits considerable morphological abnormalities and increased permeability and leakage of BBB (Prat et al., 2001; Fiala et al., 2002; Park et al., 2005; Zlokovic, 2005; Zipser et al., 2007). Our results could help account for this discrepancy. The lack of neovascularization in AD brain, despite elevated levels of angiogenic inducers, may be explained by a progressive and concomitant increase in an inflammatory environment causing newly formed blood vessels to degenerate.Deposition of amyloid \u03b2 peptide is a critical stimulus for inflammation in AD brain (Combs et al., 2001; Lue et al., 2001). We postulate that peptide deposits act as foci for assimilating clusters of mobile activated microglia and serving as sites for vascular remodeling in sustaining inflammatory environments. Microglial Flt-1 and VEGF are suggested as primary, but clearly not as sole, factors in maintaining chronic inflammatory responses dealing with removal of unwanted peptide. Although intrahippocampal peptide injection represents an acute insult, the procedure exacerbates inflammatory responses and likely compresses inflammation in this animal model into a much shorter timeframe (days) compared with the slow progression of inflammation (years) evident in AD brain. This point is testable in future studies using transgenic mouse models of AD where it is predicted that aged animals (months) will exhibit Flt-1 and VEGF microglial-dependent chemotactic processes with anti-Flt-1 Ab effective in inhibiting microgliosis and conferring neuroprotection.This work was supported by grants from the Pacific Alzheimer Research Foundation and Alzheimer's Association (J.G.M.).

In Experiment 1, we used a single-agenda test where subjects judged whether items were studied with the targeted source or not. In Experiment 2, we used a multiagenda test where subjects judged whether items were studied using the targeted source, studied using a different source, or nonstudied. To evaluate the differences between single- and multiagenda source monitoring, we trained a classifier to detect source-specific fMRI activity at study, and then we applied the classifier to data from the test phase. We focused on trials where the targeted source and the actual source differed, so we could use MVPA to track neural activity associated with both the targeted source and the actual source. Our results indicate that single-agenda monitoring was associated with increased focus on the targeted source (as evidenced by increased targeted-source activity, relative to baseline) and reduced use of information relating to the actual, nontarget source. In the multiagenda experiment, high levels of actual-source activity were associated with increased correct rejections, suggesting that subjects were using recollection of actual-source information to avoid source memory errors. In the single-agenda experiment, there were comparable levels of actual-source activity (suggesting that recollection was taking place), but the relationship between actual-source activity and behavior was absent (suggesting that subjects were failing to make proper use of this information).Research on source memory, the ability to recall the conditions under which a memory was acquired, has increasingly come to focus on how agendas at the time of retrieval can influence which mnemonic features are retrieved and used to make source judgments (Johnson et al., 1993; Mitchell et al., 2008). One factor that has been shown to influence source memory judgments is the number of sources mentioned in the test instructions: Subjects are more likely to falsely attribute items to a source when that source is the only one mentioned at test (single-agenda source monitoring) compared to when multiple sources are mentioned at test (multiagenda source monitoring) (Lindsay and Johnson, 1989; Zaragoza and Koshmider, 1989; Dodson and Johnson, 1993; Henkel et al., 2000).The goal of our study is to map out differences in how subjects make source judgments on single-agenda versus multiagenda tests. One possible difference relates to how subjects cue memory. Results from single-agenda tests suggest that, on these tests, subjects attempt to constrain retrieval to the targeted source by activating source-specific information from the study phase (Herron and Rugg, 2003a; see also Rugg, 2004; Jacoby et al., 2005a,b); according to the encoding specificity principle (Tulving and Thomson, 1973), activating targeted-source information should boost recall of the targeted source and reduce retrieval of nontarget source information. Subjects may be more prone to apply this kind of constraint on single-agenda versus multiagenda tests. Another possible difference relates to decision-making: Johnson and Raye (2000) make a distinction between activation (retrieval) of information and how strongly subjects \u201cweight\u201d (use) retrieved information. If subjects focus on the target source during single-agenda tests, they may retrieve information pertaining to nontarget sources but fail to properly use this information when making their source judgments.To evaluate these hypotheses, we ran functional MRI (fMRI) studies where we manipulated use of single-agenda versus multiagenda instructions. In these studies, we used multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) (Norman et al., 2006) to measure activation (at test) of source-specific patterns of brain activity from the study phase. We focused on trials where the targeted source and the actual source differed (i.e., subjects were asked \u201cWas this word studied with source X?\u201d when it was actually studied with source Y). We hypothesized that different approaches to memory cuing and decision-making would be associated with distinct patterns of activation. If subjects are more prone to constrain retrieval (by activating targeted-source information) in the single-agenda case, this should show up as an increase in neural activation of the targeted-source pattern in the single-agenda condition. Also, we can evaluate how well subjects are using recollection of the actual (nontarget) source by looking at the relationship between neural activation of the actual-source pattern and behavior. If subjects are using actual-source information to make their source decisions, high levels of actual-source activation (indicating recollection of the actual, nontarget source) should be associated with increased correct rejections. We predicted that actual-source activation would be more closely tied to behavior in the multiagenda (vs the single-agenda) experiment.Eleven people participated in Experiment 1 (four female, ages 20\u201326). Twelve people participated in Experiment 2 (six female, ages 19\u201328). Subjects were drawn from the graduate and undergraduate student community at Princeton University and received financial compensation for their participation. The experiments were run sequentially (first Experiment 1, then Experiment 2).Experimental stimuli consisted of 216 noun words drawn from the MRC database (Coltheart, 1981; Wilson, 1988). The words that we used in the experiment were all between 4 and 9 letters in length ( = 5.33) and had a Kucera and Francis frequency rating of between 1 and 50 ( = 17.52). The familiarity rating of the words was between 500 and 620 ( = 541.84), the concreteness rating was between 550 and 670 ( = 592.22), and the imagery rating was between 490 and 659 ( = 585.48).The words were presented to subjects on the computer via a projection system that reflected the images onto a mirror above subjects' eyes in the bore of the magnet. Subjects studied a total of 162 words. All 162 of these words were also presented on the source memory test, mixed in with 54 new words. The E-Prime software package (Psychology Software Tools) was used to present stimuli and collect responses.The behavioral paradigm that we used was an exclusion test (Jacoby, 1991). Subjects were asked to study nouns; each word was encoded using either the artist encoding task, the function encoding task, or the read encoding task (the tasks are described below). During the test phase, subjects viewed all studied items in addition to new, unstudied items. On each trial, subjects were given a task cue (\u201cArtist?\u201d, \u201cFunction?\u201d, or \u201cRead?\u201d), followed by a blank screen (lasting 3\u20137 s), followed by the test word. When the test word appeared, subjects had to indicate whether that word was studied using the targeted task; Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 used slightly different test instructions (described below). Test trials in this paradigm be divided up into three types: congruent trials, where the test word was studied using the targeted source; incongruent trials, where the test word was studied using a nontarget source; and new-item trials, where the test word did not appear at study.Experiment 1 used single-agenda instructions. In this experiment, subjects were instructed to press one button to indicate with high confidence that the test word was studied using the targeted task, a second button to indicate with low confidence that the test word was studied using the targeted task, and a third button to indicate that the test word was not studied using the targeted task (subjects rarely used the \u201clow-confidence yes\u201d response, so we collapsed together \u201chigh-confidence yes\u201d and low-confidence yes responses into a single \u201cyes\u201d response category when analyzing the data). Experiment 2 was identical to Experiment 1, except it used multiagenda instructions: For each test word, subjects were instructed to press one button to indicate that the test word was studied using the targeted task, a second button to indicate that the test word was studied using a different task, and a third button to indicate that the test word was new (nonstudied). Note that, here, subjects had to discriminate between three classes of items (targeted task, different task, and new), whereas in Experiment 1 subjects only had to discriminate between two classes of items (targeted and not targeted, where \u201cnot targeted\u201d encompassed items studied using a different task and new items).Both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 consisted of six runs, where each run consisted of a study phase and then a test phase that probed subjects' memory for the immediately preceding study phase. The sequence of events during a run is illustrated in Figure 1 and described below (the test instructions shown in the figure are from Experiment 1).Illustration of the experimental procedure used during a single scanning run, where each run consisted of a study phase and a test phase (separated by a 1-min serial response task). The left side of the figure illustrates the sequence of events during the study phase. The study phase consisted of miniblocks (lasting 3 trials) during which subjects performed a particular encoding task (artist, function, or read). The lower-left part of the figure shows the trial sequence during an artist-task miniblock. On each study trial, subjects were instructed to perform the specified encoding task for 2 s (without overtly responding); after 2 s, an asterisk appeared, at which point subjects had 2 s to enter their 1-to-5 response. The right side of the figure illustrates the sequence of events during the test phase. The test phase consisted of miniblocks (lasting 3 trials) during which subjects were asked to target a particular encoding task. The lower-right part of the figure shows two example test trials from a read-task miniblock. Subjects were presented with a mixture of old items from the study phase and new items. On each test trial, subjects were given a task cue, followed by a test word; upon presentation of the test word, subjects had to indicate whether they had studied that word with the targeted task. The test screens shown here are from Experiment 1 (the test instructions differed slightly for Experiment 2).During the study phase, words were presented, one at a time. For each word, subjects encoded that word using the artist task, the function task, or the read task. The artist and function tasks were adapted from Dzulkifli and Wilding (2005) (see also Johnson et al., 1997a), and the read task was adapted from Davachi et al. (2003). For the artist task, subjects were asked to rate how easy it would be to draw each object, on a scale of 1\u20135 where 1 is easy and 5 is hard. For the function task, subjects were asked to think of functions for each object, and then to press a key corresponding to the number of functions they were able to generate (1\u20135). For the read task, subjects silently read words backwards to themselves (the words were displayed forwards, not backwards) and rated how difficult it was to do so (where 1 is easy and 5 is hard). For all tasks, subjects entered their responses on a keypad while lying in the scanner.Each study phase consisted of 27 trials that were evenly split across the 3 encoding tasks (i.e., subjects studied 9 words using the artist task, 9 words using the function task, and 9 words using the read task). Trials were arranged in miniblocks of 3 trials, where all trials in the miniblock used the same encoding task. For each miniblock, subjects were first given a task cue (lasting 6 s) that notified them which task they would be performing. The task cue was followed by 3 words presented for 4 s each. For each word, the 4-s presentation period was broken into \u201cstudy\u201d and \u201cresponse\u201d phases as follows. For the first two seconds, subjects saw only the word and the rating scale that they would use. During the last two seconds, a small star appeared above the word, and subjects had to enter their numerical (1\u20135) rating using the keypad. After each study phase, subjects spent 1 min completing a basic serial response task, where numbers appeared on the screen and subjects were required to press buttons corresponding to these numbers. The test phase immediately followed the end of the serial response task.During the test phase, subjects were presented with a mixture of all 27 items they had seen at study and 9 new words. For each word, subjects were first given a task cue that specified one of the three encoding tasks (e.g., Artist?). We will refer to this task as the targeted task. The task cue was presented for 1 s, and then a blank screen was presented for variable-length delay period, lasting 3, 5, or 7 s (for each test phase, 24 test trials had a 3-s delay, 9 trials had a 5-s delay, and 3 trials had a 7-s delay). After the delay, the test word was presented.As mentioned above, the instructions for responding to the test word were different for Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. In Experiment 1, subjects were required to indicate whether the item was studied with the targeted task or not. In Experiment 2, subjects were required to indicate whether the item was studied using the targeted task, a different task, or was new. In both experiments, subjects had two seconds to enter their response; if they did not respond in time, the trial timed out (and \u201cno response\u201d was recorded in the data file). After each test trial, there was a variable-length delay (24 test trials had a 2-s delay, 9 trials had a 4-s delay, and 3 trials had a 6-s delay). During the test period, subjects switched retrieval orientations every 3 trials. That is, they received 3 trials in a row where they were asked to target one encoding task; then, for the next 3 trials, they were asked to target a different encoding task, and so on. Exactly half of the test trials were incongruent, 25% were congruent trials, and 25% were new trials. Each of the three encoding tasks served equally often as the targeted task.The fMRI data were acquired on a Siemens Allegra 3 Tesla scanner at the Center for the Study of Brain, Mind, and Behavior at Princeton University. Anatomical brain images were acquired with an MP-RAGE sequence consisting of the following parameters: 176 sagittally oriented slices, repetition time (TR) = 2500 ms; echo time (TE) = 4.38 ms; voxel size = 1.0 \u00d7 1.0 \u00d7 1.0 mm; flip angle = 78\u00b0; field of view (FOV) = 256 mm. Functional images were acquired with an EPI sequence where 34 sagittal slices covering the whole brain were collected every 2 s (TR length). TE = 30 ms; voxel size = 3.0 \u00d7 3.0 \u00d7 3.9 mm; flip angle = 75\u00b0; FOV = 192 mm. Anatomical images were acquired at the start of the session. The main part of the experiment consisted of six functional runs. As described earlier, each run encompassed a single study phase and test phase; 292 images were collected per run.We used the Analysis of Funtional NeuroImages (AFNI) fMRI data analysis software package (Cox, 1996) to preprocess the data. First, all functional images were coregistered with the first functional scan, and signal spikes were removed. A motion correction algorithm was applied to the data to remove any artifacts associated with head motion. Within each run, linear and quadratic trends were removed to remove the effects of scanner drift. No spatial smoothing was applied to the dataset.We used MVPA to measure activation (at test) of source-specific patterns of fMRI activity from the study phase. The MVPA approach to analyzing fMRI data involves training a pattern classifier to detect multivoxel patterns of fMRI data corresponding to particular cognitive states (for reviews, see Haynes and Rees, 2006; Norman et al., 2006). By aggregating the information that is present in multiple voxels' responses, MVPA achieves a higher level of sensitivity to the subject's cognitive state than standard mass-univariate approaches. In our study, the increased sensitivity of MVPA makes it possible to track fluctuations in activation of the targeted source and also fluctuations in source-specific recollection across single brain scans (where each scan was acquired over a 2 s period). These fluctuations, in turn, can be related to subjects' behavior.Our MVPA analysis procedure closely resembled the procedure that we used previously by Polyn et al. (2005). The procedure was composed of three steps: First, we selected voxels to use in the classification analysis. Second, we trained a classifier to discriminate between study-phase brain patterns corresponding to subjects performing the artist, function, and read encoding tasks. Third, to measure activation of study-phase patterns, we applied the trained classifier to single (2-s) brain scans from the test phase. The output of the classifier gives us a graded index of how well the test pattern matches the artist, function, and read brain patterns from the study phase. As is typical for MVPA analyses, the analysis procedure was performed within individual subjects (i.e., voxel selection, classifier training, and classifier testing were all performed on data from the same subject).To select voxels for the classification analysis, we ran a mass-univariate General Linear Model analysis in AFNI, and we found the 1000 voxels (across the whole brain) that were most strongly affected by the encoding task manipulation (artist vs function vs read) at study. After completing voxel selection, the functional data from these 1000 voxels were loaded into MATLAB (Mathworks) using the Princeton MVPA Toolkit (http://www.csbmb.princeton.edu/mvpa). All of the subsequent classification steps used the MVPA Toolkit. First, we -scored the functional data separately for each voxel and each run, to ensure that we had a normalized activation value across runs. Next, we trained a simple neural network classifier (looking just at the selected voxels) to discriminate between single brain scans acquired while subjects were performing the artist, function, and read encoding tasks at study. The neural network consisted of two layers: an input layer with 1000 units (corresponding to each of the 1000 selected voxels), and an output layer with 3 units (one per encoding task). Each input unit was connected in a feedforward manner to all 3 output units; these connection weights define a function that maps between voxel activity values and encoding task. Neural network training was implemented using the backpropagation algorithm, which iteratively adjusts connection weights to minimize prediction error when mapping between inputs and outputs (Rumelhart et al., 1996). After this training process, we used the classifier to evaluate a series of test patterns (single brain scans) that had not been presented during classifier training. For most of the analyses reported here, we selected voxels and trained the classifier using all 6 runs of study-phase data, and then we applied the classifier to all 6 runs of test-phase data. We also present the results of analyses where we selected voxels and trained the classifier using data from 5 of 6 study-phase runs, and then we applied the classifier to data from the sixth (\u201cleft out\u201d) study-phase run. Additional details regarding our MVPA analysis methods are provided in the supplemental materials, available at www.jneurosci.org, including classifier \u201cimportance maps\u201d that graphically depict which voxels the classifier used to distinguish between the study phase task conditions.We focused our MVPA analyses on new-item and incongruent test trials. For these analyses, we binned the task-specific classifier outputs for each trial according to the role each task played on that trial. For new-item trials, the classifier outputs were binned according to whether a particular task was the targeted task (TT) on that trial or one of the other tasks (OT) on that trial. For incongruent-item trials, the classifier outputs were binned according to whether a particular task was the TT on that trial, the actual task (AT) that was performed on that item at study, or the other task (OT). For example, if subjects were asked Artist? but the item was originally studied using the Function task, then TT = artist, AT = function, and OT = read. As described below, the OT can be used as a baseline when measuring activity related to the targeted task and the actual task. Note that the mapping of tasks (artist, function, read) onto conditions (TT, AT, and OT) varies from trial to trial.Our analysis procedure is founded on two key claims. The first claim is that we can measure memory targeting by looking at the difference between TT and OT activity. We hypothesized that subjects would attempt to constrain retrieval to the targeted task by performing the targeted task on the test word (Jacoby et al., 2005a, 2005b), and that subjects would be more prone to do this in the single-agenda (vs multiagenda) condition. If this is the case, we should see a selective increase in TT activity relative to OT activity, and this increase should be larger in Experiment 1 than in Experiment 2.The second claim is that, on incongruent trials, recollection of the actual task should lead to an increase in AT activity relative to OT activity. Prior research has established that recollection of memories from a particular source is associated with activation of source-specific patterns of activity from the study phase (Nyberg et al., 2000; Wheeler et al., 2000; Vaidya et al., 2002; Wheeler and Buckner, 2003; Kahn et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2004; Johnson and Rugg, 2004, 2007; Woodruff et al., 2005). Thus, in our exclusion paradigm, we would expect strong recollection of the actual source on incongruent trials to be associated with strong AT activity (relative to OT activity). Likewise, weak recollection of the actual source should be associated with weak AT activity (relative to OT activity). Note that our MVPA approach to dissociating targeted-task versus actual-task activity only works for incongruent trials. On congruent trials, the targeted task and the actual task are the same, so there is no way to tease apart activity relating to targeting versus recollection of the actual source; as such, we did not include congruent trials in our analysis. Also, we acknowledge that, in principle, other factors besides actual-task recollection could affect AT activity. For example, subjects might enact a strategy of performing all three tasks at test, to see which one fits best with the test word. A key point in this regard is that nonselectively performing all three tasks will affect TT, AT, and OT activity equally, so this strategy cannot be used to explain differences between TT and AT activity (on the one hand) and OT activity (on the other).Importantly, the idea that actual-task activity indexes recollection makes it possible to assess the relationship between targeted-task activity and recollection of the actual task. If targeting of one task reduces recollection of other tasks, then \u2013 across incongruent trials \u2013 high levels of TT activity (indicating strong constraint) should be associated with low levels of AT activity (indicating low recollection of the actual task), resulting in a negative correlation between TT and AT activity. We expected that this negative correlation would be easier to observe in Experiment 1 than in Experiment 2, insofar as we expected TT activity to be lower overall in Experiment 2; this (anticipated) restriction in the range of TT should reduce the size of the correlation.The link between actual-task activity and recollection also makes it possible to determine whether recollection of the actual (nontarget) task is differentially used in single- and multiagenda source monitoring. The key idea here is that AT recollection is not, on its own, sufficient to trigger a correct rejection. AT recollection needs to happen early in the trial (otherwise, subjects will not be able to respond before the 2-s deadline) and, more importantly, subjects need to attend to this early trial recollection to benefit from it (Johnson and Raye, 2000). We can measure how strongly subjects are attending to AT recollection by measuring the relationship between early trial AT activity and behavioral accuracy. If subjects are attending to AT recollection, high levels of AT activity early in the trial (indicating that AT recollection occurred, and that it occurred early enough to influence responding) should be associated with increased correct rejections. If subjects are not attending to AT recollection, this relationship between early trial AT activity and correct rejections should be absent. We expected that subjects would devote more scrutiny to AT recollection in the multiagenda test than in the single-agenda test; as such, we predicted that the relationship between early trial AT activity and behavior would be stronger in Experiment 2 than in Experiment 1. Table 1 presents a summary of the predictions described above.Summary of predictions for single- and multiagenda source monitoringAll of our MVPA analyses depend on the idea that we can train a classifier to successfully detect patterns of brain activity associated with performing the artist, function, and read encoding tasks. To assess our ability to discriminate between task-specific encoding states, we trained the classifier on study-phase data from 5 of 6 scanner runs, and measured the classifier's ability to correctly predict (for each individual scan) which encoding task the subject was performing on the remaining study run. The correspondence between the classifier's predictions and the actual encoding task (as indexed by correlation) was significantly above chance for each individual subject. The average percentage correct classification of individual brain volumes (chance = 33.3%) was 79.1% for Experiment 1 (SEM = 3.7%) and 73.9% for Experiment 2 (SEM = 3.0%); classification accuracy was not significantly different across experiments, (21) = 1.10,  > 0.05. For further details on study-phase classification, see the supplemental materials, available at www.jneurosci.org.For all subsequent analyses, the classifier was trained on study-phase data from all 6 scanner runs, and was applied to test-phase data from all 6 scanner runs. For each new-item and incongruent test trial, we measured the activity of each classifier output unit (artist, function, and read) for 7 successive scans (lasting 2 s each), starting with the scan when the test word was presented. As discussed earlier, classifier outputs from new-item and incongruent-item trials were binned according to whether that task was the targeted task, the actual task performed on the item at study, or the other task.For all of the results presented below, dependent measures (e.g., classifier output for a particular condition) were computed separately for each individual subject. Figures and tables show the mean and SEM (across subjects) of these per-subject measures. We used two-tailed  tests (applied to these per-subject measures) to assess whether effects were reliable across subjects.To evaluate our prediction that the amount of targeted task activity would be higher in Experiment 1 versus Experiment 2, we computed the average amount of TT activity in both studies. Figure 2 shows the event-related classifier output averages for both experiments. The left side of the figure plots average classifier output for TT and OT on new-item trials, and the right side of the figure plots average classifier output for TT, AT, and OT on incongruent trials. Figure 2 plots baseline-corrected targeted-task activity (TT\u2013OT) for new-item trials and incongruent trials, as a function of Experiment (1 vs 2). For all of the subplots in Figure 2, classifier output is shown for 7 successive scans, starting with the scan when the test word was presented.Event-related averages of classifier output in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. Classifier output is shown for 7 successive scans, starting with the scan when the test word was presented. The left side of the figure shows classifier output for new-item trials, and the right side of the figure shows classifier output for incongruent-item trials. The graphs in  show raw classifier outputs, and the graphs in  show difference scores (TT\u2013OT and AT\u2013OT). Error bars in  indicate the SEM (across subjects) of the difference score. Individual bars marked with asterisks are significantly different from zero; pairs of bars marked with asterisks are significantly different from each other. * < 0.05; ** < 0.01.In Experiment 1, for both new-item and incongruent trials, TT activity was significantly higher than OT activity at multiple time points. This provides strong evidence that subjects were activating the TT representation at test. The supplemental materials, available at www.jneurosci.org, contain further analyses exploring the timing of TT activity. These additional analyses, which control for \u201cspill-over\u201d of TT activity from the preceding trial, demonstrate that TT activity was triggered by the test word, as opposed to the task cue that preceded the test word; these timing results fit with the idea, mentioned earlier, that TT activity reflects subjects performing the targeted task on the test word. In Experiment 2, the TT\u2013OT difference was also significant for some time points, but numerically the TT\u2013OT difference scores were smaller in Experiment 2 than in Experiment 1. When we directly compared TT\u2013OT difference scores across experiments, we found that the difference was significant for incongruent trials at time points 3 and 5, and the difference was significant for new-item trials at time point 4; when we combined new-item and incongruent trials, the cross-experiment difference in TT\u2013OT was significant at time points 3, 4, and 5.According to the encoding specificity principle, TT activity should lead to reduced recollection of AT information on incongruent trials. As a first-pass measure, we compared the overall level of baseline-corrected AT activity (i.e., AT\u2013OT) in the two experiments; as discussed above, this difference score provides an index of the degree of AT recollection that is taking place on incongruent trials. If TT activity suppresses AT recollection, then AT activity should be lower in Experiment 1 (where TT activity was relatively high) than in Experiment 2 (where TT activity was relatively low). Contrary to this prediction, we found that AT activity rose significantly above baseline in both experiments, and that the level of baseline-corrected AT activity was virtually identical across experiments (Fig. 2, bottom).To further investigate the relationship between TT and AT activity, we ran a more sensitive within-subjects analysis where we correlated (across incongruent trials) the level of TT activity with the level of AT activity. If TT activity suppresses AT recollection, then we would expect to see a negative correlation within individual subjects (assuming that there is adequate across-trial variability in TT activity). The TT\u2013AT correlation was computed separately for each time point (scan) in the trial, starting with the scan when the test word was presented (e.g., we correlated TT activity at time point 1 with AT activity at time point 1; we correlated TT activity at time point 2 with AT activity at time point 2; and so on).One complicating factor in this analysis is that classifiers can register a negative correlation between cognitive states even if (at a \u201cprocess\u201d level) the cognitive states are not related to each other. Intuitively, the more that one pattern is present in the brain, the less any other pattern will be present. With the neural network classifiers that we are using, the process is not completely zero-sum (i.e., it is possible to increase one classifier output without reducing other outputs), but we commonly observe some degree of negative correlation. To deal with this issue, we also computed the correlation between the TT and OT classifier outputs; then we subtracted out the TT\u2013OT correlation from the TT\u2013AT correlation. This measure factors out the \u201cbaseline\u201d level of negative correlation (which should apply equally to TT\u2013OT and TT\u2013AT) and makes it possible to test whether TT activity is more negatively correlated with AT activity than with activity of the third (irrelevant) task.Figure 3 shows the average \u201ccorrected correlation value\u201d (across subjects) for each time point, for both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. After correcting for the TT\u2013OT correlation, there was a significant negative correlation between TT and AT activity at multiple time points (4, 5, and 6) in Experiment 1. In contrast, the correlation between TT and AT activity was not significant for any time point in Experiment 2. These results fit with our prediction that, when subjects attempt to constrain recall by activating the targeted task, TT activity will reduce recall of memories from other sources. The lack of a significant correlation for Experiment 2 can be explained in terms of the lower overall level of (baseline-corrected) TT activity in that experiment, which effectively restricts the range of TT and squelches the correlation. Importantly, the correlational nature of these results prevents us from making strong causal inferences. The observed negative correlation in Experiment 1 could be caused either by TT activity blocking AT recollection, or by AT recollection displacing TT activity (intuitively, strong recollection of the actual task will make it difficult to focus on the targeted task). The two possibilities are not mutually exclusive, and it seems likely that both of these situations occur to some extent.Correlation between TT and AT classifier activity (across incongruent trials) in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. Correlation values were computed separately for each time point (scan) in the trial, starting with the scan when the test word was presented. TT\u2013AT correlation values were corrected by subtracting out the corresponding TT\u2013OT correlation value; this corrected score indicates whether TT activity was more strongly correlated with AT activity than OT activity. Error bars indicate the SEM (across subjects) of the corrected correlation measure. Individual bars marked with asterisks are significantly different from zero. * < 0.05; ** < 0.01.The finding that AT activity was above-baseline in both experiments allows us to look at how AT recollection affected behavior in Experiment 1 versus Experiment 2; as discussed earlier, we can use the relationship between AT activity and behavior on incongruent trials to assess the weight that subjects are giving to AT recollection when making source memory decisions. Behavioral results for Experiments 1 and 2 are presented in Tables 2 and 3, respectively (see the supplemental materials, available at www.jneurosci.org, for additional behavioral analyses). As in previous comparisons of single-agenda versus multiagenda tests (Lindsay and Johnson, 1989), false alarms were higher in the single-agenda experiment; this trend was significant for new items, (21) = 2.28,  = 0.03, but not for incongruent items, (21) = 0.56,  > 0.05. To get an overall sense of the relationship between AT activity and behavior, we plotted event-related averages of baseline-corrected AT scores (i.e., AT\u2013OT) for correct rejections and errors, in both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 (note that both incorrect responses and failures to respond in time were counted as errors). The results of these analyses are shown in Figure 4.Experiment 1: Mean proportions of trials where subjects responded \u2033yes,\u2033 responded \u2033no,\u2033 or failed to respond in time as a function of trial type (congruent, incongruent, and new)Experiment 2: Mean proportion of trials where subjects responded \u2033same task,\u2033 responded \u2033different task,\u2033 responded \u2033new,\u2033 or failed to respond in time as a function of trial type (congruent, incongruent, and new)Analyses of the relationship between actual-task activity and behavior on incongruent trials in Experiments 1 and 2. , shows event-related averages of baseline-corrected AT activity (AT\u2013OT) for Experiments 1 and 2, split by whether subjects made a correct rejection (CR) or an error (ERR). In , we used AUC measure (Fawcett, 2006) to index how well AT activity discriminated between correct rejection and error trials. AUC scores range from 0 to 1, where 0.5 indicates chance discrimination. AUC scores >0.5 indicate that AT activity was associated with increased correct rejections, and AUC scores <0.5 indicate that AT activity was associated with increased errors. Error bars in  indicate the SEM (across subjects) of the CR versus ERR difference for that time point (note that CR and ERR bars were not individually tested vs zero). Error bars in  indicate the SEM (across subjects) of the AUC score. In , pairs of bars marked with asterisks are significantly different from each other. In , individual bars marked with asterisks are significantly different from chance (0.5), and pairs of bars marked with asterisks are significantly different from each other. * < 0.05; ** < 0.01.We also used an area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic-curve (AUC) measure (Fawcett, 2006) to sensitively index how well AT activity discriminates between correct rejection and error trials. Specifically, the AUC measure indexes the overlap between the observed distributions of AT activity scores associated with correct rejections versus errors; AUC provides extra information (beyond looking at means and SDs) because it factors in the entire shape of the distribution. The AUC analysis was run separately for each time point (scan) in the trial, starting with the scan when the test word was presented. AUC scores range from 0 to 1, where 0.5 indicates chance discrimination. AUC scores >0.5 indicate that AT activity was associated with increased correct rejections, and AUC scores <0.5 indicate that AT activity was associated with increased errors. If subjects are using AT recollection when making their source memory judgments, AUC scores should be >0.5. Note that we used AT (alone) instead of AT\u2013OT as our trial-by-trial measure of recollection when computing AUC. Subtracting out OT is valuable for demonstrating that (on average) the actual task is activated more strongly than the other task. However, when measuring recollection on a trial-by-trial basis, subtracting out OT adds noise relative to using AT alone (since the proportion of OT variance that is not shared with AT is large, relative to the proportion of variance that is shared with AT). The AUC scores for Experiments 1 and 2 are shown in Figure 4.The results of these analyses show clear differences between Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. In Experiment 1, there was an overall trend for AT activity to be negatively associated with behavioral accuracy: For all but one time point, AT\u2013OT was numerically higher for errors than for correct rejections; this trend was significant at the end of the trial, at time point 6. In contrast, in Experiment 2, early trial AT activity was positively associated with behavioral accuracy: AT\u2013OT was significantly higher for correct rejections than errors at time point 2, and the AUC measure was significantly >0.5 at this time point. When we directly compared the AUC scores from the two experiments, we found that AUC scores were significantly higher for Experiment 2 versus 1 (indicating a more positive relationship between AT activity and correct rejections) at time points 2, 6, and 7.To summarize, our key prediction regarding the relationship between AT activity and behavior was confirmed: Early trial AT activity was associated with correct rejections in Experiment 2 but not Experiment 1. The other main finding from this analysis, the relationship between late-trial AT and errors in Experiment 1, was unexpected, and merits further discussion. One possible interpretation of this result is that subjects in Experiment 1 were treating recollection of any information (even AT information) as evidence for the targeted task; for an example of how subjects can misattribute retrieved information from one source as evidence for another source, see Henkel et al. (2000). However, the timing of the effect in Experiment 1 argues against this interpretation: If AT recollection were actually causing errors, then we would expect to see this effect early in the trial, but the association between AT activity and errors was only present late in the trial (\u223c10\u201312 s after stimulus onset). The timing of this effect suggests that increased AT activity on error trials in Experiment 1 may reflect postdecisional processing (i.e., subjects recalling and thinking about the actual task after they made an error) as opposed to predecisional processing; informally, subjects often reported that they would respond yes to an item on an incongruent trial and then, immediately afterward, they would realize that the item was from the wrong source (Van Zandt and Maldonado-Molina, 2004). Errors in both experiments may be attributable to factors that are \u201cinvisible\u201d to the classifier (e.g., item familiarity) as opposed to task-specific activity (for additional discussion of this point, see the Limitations of our analysis procedure section below).The goal of this study was to use neural data to gain psychological insight into how subjects make source memory judgments when they are asked to consider one source (single-agenda) versus when they are asked to consider multiple sources (multiagenda). Our first prediction was that subjects would be more likely to perform the targeted encoding task at test given single-agenda versus multiagenda instructions. Our MVPA results support this prediction: Targeted-task activation was significantly higher (relative to baseline) in Experiment 1 than in Experiment 2. We also hypothesized that activation of the targeted task would be associated with reduced recollection of the actual task on incongruent trials. Support for this claim was mixed: The level of actual-task activation (relative to baseline) was similar across experiments despite the difference in targeted-task activation. However, a more sensitive within-subjects analysis revealed that TT and AT activity were negatively correlated within individual subjects (Fig. 3). Our final prediction was that subjects would make better use of AT recollection on a multiagenda task, compared with a single-agenda task. Our results support this prediction: In Experiment 2, high levels of AT activation were associated with increased correct rejections on incongruent trials, but this relationship was not present in Experiment 1 (despite similar overall levels of AT activation). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that subjects can retrieve diagnostic source information but nonetheless fail to use this information when making their source judgments.The key methodological innovation underlying these findings was our use of pattern classifiers to track the appearance of task-specific activity during retrieval. As discussed earlier, MVPA increases sensitivity to the comings and goings of cognitive states by aggregating the information that is present in multiple voxels. This increase in sensitivity allowed us to derive meaningful measures of TT, AT and OT activity for each incongruent trial. Importantly, these MVPA analyses should be viewed as complementing (not replacing) standard voxel-based General Linear Model analyses. While MVPA is useful for addressing questions about what information is present in the subject's head at a particular point in time, whole-brain MVPA analyses are less useful for mapping out which brain regions are involved in particular cognitive processes (for a discussion of pitfalls associated with using whole-brain MVPA for brain mapping, see Norman et al., 2006). In the supplemental materials, available at www.jneurosci.org, we present voxel-based analyses exploring which brain regions discriminate between different tasks at study and which brain regions discriminate between correct versus incorrect responses to incongruent items at test.Our results add to the growing body of neural evidence supporting agenda-dependent memory, the idea that subjects' goals at the time of retrieval can impact what information comes to mind and how subjects use this information (Mitchell et al., 2008; for examples of relevant neuroimaging studies, see Johnson et al., 1997b; Ranganath et al., 2000; Rugg and Wilding, 2000; Dobbins and Wagner, 2005; Dobbins and Han, 2006; for reviews of relevant studies, see Rugg, 2004; Simons, 2009). To our knowledge, there has only been one previous neuroimaging study that directly compared single-agenda to multiagenda source monitoring: Raye et al. (2000) (Experiment 1C) compared a single-agenda test (\u201cWas the item studied as a picture?\u201d) to a multiagenda test (\u201cWas the item studied as a picture or studied auditorily?\u201d) and found differences in frontal activity on the two types of tests. This finding indicates that processing is different in the two conditions but it does not indicate whether the difference relates to memory cuing or to the evaluation of retrieved information (or both).While direct comparisons of single-agenda and multiagenda tests are scarce, there have been numerous imaging studies that speak to our hypotheses (set forth in the Introduction) about how subjects approach single-agenda tests. For example, a recent study by Woodruff et al. (2006) used a single-agenda source memory test and, like our study, found that subjects activate information relating to the targeted source. In Woodruff et al. (2006), subjects studied picture and word stimuli mixed together. At test, subjects were asked to target items from a particular source (e.g., pictures). For each test item, subjects were asked to say \u201cyes\u201d to items that were studied using the targeted source, and to say \u201cno\u201d otherwise. Woodruff et al. (2006) focused their fMRI analysis on new-item trials. They found that brain activity on new-item trials differed as a function of whether subjects were targeting picture versus word memories. Furthermore, brain activity patterns associated with targeting picture versus word memories were similar to brain activity patterns associated with studying pictures versus words, respectively (for a similar result, see Hornberger et al., 2006).Additional relevant evidence comes from single-agenda studies that have compared ERPs on congruent and incongruent trials. Specifically, these studies have looked at the effect of retrieval orientation on the parietal old/new ERP effect, an ERP correlate of recollection (for discussion of this ERP effect, see Rugg et al., 2000; Rugg and Curran, 2007). Many of these studies have found that the parietal old/new effect is larger for congruent than for incongruent trials, suggesting that subjects have some ability to prevent recollection of information that mismatches the targeted source (Herron and Rugg, 2003a,b; Dzulkifli and Wilding, 2005; Herron and Wilding, 2005; Dzulkifli et al., 2006; for similar results from a slightly different paradigm, see Dywan et al., 1998, 2001, 2002).The fMRI and ERP studies reviewed in this section provide some support for the idea that (on single-agenda tests) subjects attempt to constrain retrieval to the targeted source: The fMRI studies found activation of the targeted source, and the ERP studies found reduced recollection of nontarget memories. However, these studies did not address the relationship between activation of the targeted source and recollection of nontarget memories. In our study, we were able to address this relationship by simultaneously measuring targeted-task activation and actual-task activation, and then correlating these measures across trials. Also, the fMRI and ERP studies reviewed above did not measure the relationship between recollection of nontarget memories and behavior. In our study, we demonstrated a significant link between actual-task activity and behavioral accuracy in Experiment 2 (but not in Experiment 1), and we used this link to argue that subjects make better use of nontarget recollection in Experiment 2 versus Experiment 1.Importantly, the classifier was trained to detect patterns of activity that discriminate between the three tasks. This training procedure gives the classifier the ability to detect recollection of task-specific details, but it does not give the classifier the ability to detect recollection of nondiagnostic details (i.e., details shared by all three tasks) or feelings of familiarity. For evidence that subjects are influenced by nondiagnostic forms of memory on exclusion tests, see Dobbins and McCarthy (2008). Another limitation of our analysis procedure is that it focuses on activation (at test) of patterns from the study phase. As such, the analysis procedure will not detect processes that are engaged only at test (not at study).Our long-term goal is to exploit the sensitivity of MVPA to examine how memory cuing and decision-making processes vary (across subject populations, and as a function of situational factors). For example, recent results from Jacoby et al. (2005b) and Velanova et al. (2007) suggest that (on single-agenda tests with tasks as sources) elderly adults are less likely than young adults to perform the targeted task at test. Also, ERP studies have identified several manipulations that affect how strongly subjects orient to the targeted task, e.g., reducing the memorability of the targeted source (Herron and Rugg, 2003a; Dzulkifli et al., 2006; but see Herron and Wilding, 2005) and varying the targeted source unpredictably from trial to trial at test (vs using a blocked design) (Johnson and Rugg, 2006). We plan to explore these (and other) factors using variants of the design used here.Our MVPA approach provides a new kind of evidence regarding how information is processed during memory retrieval. Using this technique, we compared retrieval processing during single-agenda (in Experiment 1) and multiagenda source monitoring (in Experiment 2). We observed that single-agenda source monitoring is associated with increased memory targeting and reduced use of retrieved diagnostic details. Going forward, the ability to separately track targeted-task and actual-task activity should help us to develop more nuanced theories of how subjects cue memory, how cues interact with stored memory traces, how subjects make memory decisions, and how these processes go awry in subjects with memory disorders.This work was supported by National Institute of Mental Health Grant P50 MH062196 to K.A.N. and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship to S.G.R.M.

Previous work in  has identified several kinases, phosphatases, and an E3 ligase that are critical for determining the nuclear translocation and/or stability of clock proteins. The present study evaluated the function of p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) in the  circadian system. In mammals, RSK1 is a light- and clock-regulated kinase known to be activated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, but there is no direct evidence that it functions as a component of the circadian system. Here, we show that  S6KII RNA displays rhythms in abundance, indicative of circadian control. Importantly, an  null mutant exhibits a short-period circadian phenotype that can be rescued by expression of the wild-type gene in clock neurons, indicating a role for S6KII in the molecular oscillator. Peak PER clock protein expression is elevated in the mutant, indicative of enhanced stability, whereas  mRNA level is decreased, consistent with enhanced feedback repression. Gene reporter assays show that decreased S6KII is associated with increased PER repression. Surprisingly, we demonstrate a physical interaction between S6KII and the casein kinase 2 regulatory subunit (CK2\u03b2), suggesting a functional relationship between the two kinases. In support of such a relationship, there are genetic interactions between  and  mutations, , which indicate that CK2 activity is required for S6KII action. We propose that the two kinases cooperate within clock neurons to fine-tune circadian period, improving the precision of the clock mechanism.Organisms possess endogenous clocks that enable them to synchronize to diurnal environmental cycles and anticipate time of day. In several model systems, it is known that the circadian molecular clock consists of transcriptional/translational autoregulatory feedback loops in which clock proteins translocate to the nucleus and regulate clock gene transcription (Reppert and Weaver, 2002; Dunlap and Loros, 2005; Hardin, 2005). In , the molecular oscillator is composed of three feedback loops which are interlocked by virtue of the CLK control of  and  gene transcription. The first loop results in rhythmic PERIOD (PER) and TIMELESS (TIM) clock protein production, the second generates rhythms in the CLOCK (CLK) transcription factor and the third (Clockwork Orange) modulates the expression of several clock genes known to be regulated by the CLK transcription factor by binding to the E-box regulatory element (Glossop et al., 1999; Cyran et al., 2003; Glossop et al., 2003; Yu et al., 2006; Kadener et al., 2007; Lim et al., 2007; Matsumoto et al., 2007; Richier et al., 2008). Certain recent results, however, indicate that the CLK cycle may be more important for output than oscillator function per se (Benito et al., 2007; Zheng and Sehgal, 2008).In addition to a transcriptional requirement, circadian oscillators use post-transcriptional mechanisms to keep time (Young and Kay, 2001; Zheng and Sehgal, 2008). Prominent among such mechanisms in both flies and mammals is the phosphorylation of clock proteins, which controls their nuclear entry, stability and/or ability to repress clock gene transcription (Lee et al., 2001; Harms et al., 2004; Meng et al., 2008). In , oscillations in PER/TIM accumulation, nuclear translocation and degradation are dependent on the activities of several protein kinases [casein kinase 1\u03b5 (CK1\u03b5), casein kinase 2 (CK2) and glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2)], at least two protein phosphatases (PP2A and PP1) and an E3 ubiquitin ligase called SLIMB (Kloss et al., 1998; Price et al., 1998; Martinek et al., 2001; Grima et al., 2002; Ko et al., 2002; Akten et al., 2003; Sathyanarayanan et al., 2004; Fang et al., 2007). Remarkably, certain circadian oscillators can run for many cycles using only post-transcriptional mechanisms; a circadian rhythm in cyanobacterial KaiC autophosphorylation, for example, occurs for several cycles  in the complete absence of transcriptional feedback (Tomita et al., 2005).Given the ubiquitous requirement for post-translational mechanisms in circadian clock systems, it is of interest to identify additional kinases that might regulate oscillator function. In mammals, the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK1) is a light- and clock-regulated kinase known to be activated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (Butcher et al., 2004), although there is no direct evidence that it is required for oscillator function. Microarray-based studies have previously documented circadian changes in  () mRNA abundance, indicative of clock regulation (McDonald and Rosbash, 2001), and we have verified the microarray results in the current study using quantitative RT-PCR methods. Importantly, we show that  null mutants display a short-period circadian rhythm phenotype that can be rescued by transgenic expression of the wild-type + gene in clock neurons, demonstrating a role for the kinase in the molecular oscillator. Consistent with such a role, we report that PER abundance is altered in the  mutant. Further, we show that  and , mutations of the casein kinase 2 regulatory (CK2\u03b2) and catalytic (CK2\u03b1) subunits, respectively, are epistatic to a  mutation, indicating that CK2\u03b2 activity is required for S6KII action. Based on the circadian period phenotypes of  and  mutants, we postulate that S6KII may negatively regulate CK2 activity. Our finding that S6KII can physically interact with CK2\u03b2 supports this model. We propose that the two kinases cooperate to regulate clock gene expression and modulate circadian period.cultures were reared at 25\u00b0C and 60% relative humidity in a 12 h light/dark cycle on a modified standard medium containing wheat germ. For genetic crosses, flies were collected using CO2 anesthesia.Standard genetic crosses and visible markers [ (),  (),  () and  ()] were used to generate a recombinant X chromosome carrying both the \u0394 (region 20C1) and  (region 10E3) mutations. Putative recombinants were then balanced against an attached X chromosome and backcrossed for three generations to the  strain to reduce background differences between genotypes. The absence of S6KII protein in the recombinant strains was confirmed by Western blot analysis using a rabbit anti-S6KII antibody (Putz et al., 2004).Locomotor activity data from individual flies were collected using the  Activity Monitor system (Trikinetics). In most experiments, flies were entrained at 23\u00b0C to a 12 h light/dark cycle for 4 d and then transferred to constant darkness (DD) at the same temperature for \u223c2 weeks. Experiments using the Gal4 expression system were performed at 25\u00b0C to enhance Gal4 activity. To estimate period and visualize actograms, we used a MATLAB (MathWorks)-based signal processing toolbox (Levine et al., 2002). Period was estimated from the third peak of the correlogram. Differences in circadian period were assessed for statistical significance using an unpaired  test or an ANOVA with  comparisons.Flies were entrained in a 12 h light/dark cycle for at least 4 d, collected every 4 h, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Lights were turned off and flies were collected every 4 h for the first day of constant darkness. Total RNA was isolated from adult heads using the TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. Sample RNA was treated with DNase I (Amplification Grade; Invitrogen) to eliminate genomic DNA contamination. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 \u03bcg of RNA using Superscript II (Invitrogen). No-RT controls received water instead of transcriptase.Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) on a Stratagene Mx3000p real-time thermal cycler. Reactions contained 10 nm  gene-specific primers, 10 nm  gene-specific primers or 30 nm  gene-specific primers. The primers were:  forward, 5\u2032-CAGTGTGCCGGCCAAAGAAC-3\u2032;  reverse, 5\u2032-GCAGCCAGTCGTGCTCAAGTATTCG-3\u2032;  forward, 5\u2032-GCCCAAGATCGTGAAGAAGC-3\u2032;  reverse, 5\u2032-CGACGCACTCTGTTGTCG-3\u2032;  forward, 5\u2032-TAGTAGCCACACCCGCAGT-3\u2032;  reverse, 5\u2032-GCAATGGAAGGGGGAGTTAG-3\u2032. RT-PCR conditions were 10 min at 95\u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95\u00b0C and 22 s at 55\u00b0C. Relative mRNA abundances were calculated from cycle threshold (Ct) values and normalized to  abundance. Mean \u00b1 SEM was calculated from three independent experiments.To examine the involvement of S6KII in PER-mediated repression, we performed assays of E-box transgene activity in S2 cells. S2 cell transfections, RNA interference (RNAi) and luciferase activity assays were performed as described by Nawathean and Rosbash (2004). Briefly, double-stranded RNA was transcribed from vectors described in Nawathean and Rosbash (2004) and used for knockdown of S6KII and CK2\u03b1. S2 cells were incubated with 15 ng/ml CK2\u03b1- or 30 ng/ml S6KII-specific dsRNAs 48 h before DNA transfections. Using Cellfectin (Invitrogen), 5 ng of , 15 ng of , 25 ng of  and 25 ng of an artificial E-box reporter construct (\u00d7) were transfected into S2 cells. All plasmid constructs were obtained from M. Rosbash (Brandeis University, Waltham, MA). Luciferase activity was measured using a Packard Top Count luminometer with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity driven by the 3 \u00d7 69 E-box reporter construct was normalized to constitutively expressed Renilla luciferase as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Luciferase values were normalized between experiments, for visualization, by expressing values as a percentage of the no RNAi control. To evaluate statistical significance, values from each experiment were normalized using the formula: Xnorm = [X-mean (X)]/SD (X) to represent the number of SDs from the mean.Fly heads were collected every 4 h and homogenized in 3 volumes of Head Extraction Buffer (50 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) with 1 mm DTT, 0.4% NP40, 0.5 mm PMSF, 10 mm pNPP and a 1:100 dilution of Halt protease inhibitor mixture (Pierce). Extract buffer for pS6KII blots also contained a 1:10 dilution of PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Roche). Standard immunoblotting techniques were used to examine protein abundance for S6KII, phosphorylated S6KII (pS6KII) and PERIOD. To generate gels for blotting, 75 \u03bcg or 100 \u03bcg of protein per time point were loaded for the detection of S6KII/pS6KII or PERIOD, respectively. The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-S6KII, 1:500 (Putz et al., 2004), rabbit anti-RSK1-Ser363, 1:300 (Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-PERIOD, 1:1500 (Stanewsky et al., 1997), rat anti-N-cadherin, 1:300 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank). Bands were visualized using the ECL Western Blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Differences in S6KII protein abundance were assessed using KODAK 1D Image Analysis Software (Eastman Kodak Company) and analyzed with Welch's  test. Differences in PER protein abundance were evaluated by blind scoring of relative immunoreactivity, on a scale of 1 to 5, in three independent experiments.Hand dissected whole mounts of the fly brain were stained with antibodies according to published procedures (Suh and Jackson, 2007). Rabbit anti-S6KII, rabbit anti-PER and mouse anti-PDF (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) antisera were used at dilutions of 1:300, 1:10,000 and 1:50, respectively. The anti-S6KII antibody used for immunostaining was a gift of Dr. Jongkyeong Chung (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Yusong, Taejon, Korea) (Kim et al., 2006). Brain images were acquired using a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS confocal microscope. Mean pixel intensities for the large and small LNvs (PDF cells) were measured from a 2 \u03bcm section in the middle of the cell using the Leica LCS \u201cLite\u201d software. Background intensity was subtracted from each measurement. The data from two independent experiments was analyzed by an unpaired  test.The expression vectors for HA-tagged CK2\u03b2 and 6xMyc tagged CK2\u03b1 are described in Jauch et al. (2006). The expression vector for CK2\u03b2C109,114S was generated by subcloning the open reading frame from an established pUAST construct (Jauch et al., 2002) into the pcDNA3-HA vector. The open reading frame of S6KII was amplified by linker PCR from a full-length cDNA clone (SD05277, Berkeley  Genome Project) and cloned into I and I cut pcDNA3 vector 3\u2032 to the 6xMyc epitope sequence. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Cells were transfected for transient protein expression using JetPEI transfection reagent (Poly+ Transfections) following the manufacturers instructions and were then maintained for 48 h before lysis. Immunoprecipitations and Western blot analysis were performed as described (Jauch et al., 2006).Multiple independent microarray-based studies have documented circadian changes in RNA abundance for several hundred mRNAs expressed in  head tissues (Claridge-Chang et al., 2001; McDonald and Rosbash, 2001; Ceriani et al., 2002; Ueda et al., 2002; Y. Lin et al., 2002). In one report, microarray analysis indicated that  RNA cycled in abundance in both light/dark and constant dark conditions, with peak RNA abundance occurring in the late night/early morning (McDonald and Rosbash, 2001). Because  cycling was observed in one such study but not in several others, we used quantitative real-time RT-PCR (Q-RT-PCR) with RNA samples from  head tissues to analyze the daily profile of  RNA expression. Head tissue was used in these experiments, because the microarray-based study of McDonald and Rosbash had documented changes in  abundance using such a preparation. In addition, the FlyAtlas database indicates that  RNA is most abundant in the nervous system (Chintapalli et al., 2007). In accordance with the previous microarray result, we found that the level of  RNA changes in a diurnal manner, with peak abundance occurring between Zeitgeber time (ZT) 22 and 1 (Fig. 1). As the  transcriptional rhythm peaks near the beginning of subjective day, the gene might be regulated by the Pdp1/Vrille transcription factors which have similar rhythmic profiles and compete for binding to a regulatory element within the  gene (Cyran et al., 2003). Thus, it is of interest that consensus sequences for \u201cstrong binding\u201d of Pdp1 (Lin et al., 1997) exist within the upstream region of the fly  gene (data not shown).S6KII mRNA cycles in abundance in head tissue extracts, whereas rhythmicity is not observed for S6KII protein. ,  mRNA level at different times of day in 12 h light/dark. Relative  mRNA level indicates the amount of  message normalized to that of  (also see Materials and Methods). , S6KII protein level at different times of a 12 h light/dark cycle. Histograms represent S6KII amount relative to the nonspecific band indicated by the asterisk. Note that the S6KII protein is absent in the  null mutant. Illustrated results for  and  are averages \u00b1 SEM from three different experiments.We wished to determine whether the observed circadian change in  RNA titer was translated into a rhythm of S6KII protein abundance, and thus we measured protein levels at six different times of the diurnal cycle. These studies indicated that S6KII protein abundance was relatively constant across the cycle in  head extracts (Fig. 1). Thus, there may not be a rhythm in S6KII protein abundance, or perhaps more likely, there are differential and tissue-specific post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that mask rhythms of S6KII abundance in clock cells (i.e., S6KII may be rhythmic in clock cells but not other cell types). Similarly, an antibody against phospho-RSK1 (anti-phospho-S363), that cross-reacts with fly S6KII (S498 of S6KII), did not detect rhythms in phosphorylation of the protein as assessed in Western blotting experiments with head or adult brain extracts (data not shown). The latter result, however, does not exclude rhythms of S6KII activation as there are many other conserved sites of phosphorylation on S6KII.We attempted to localize S6KII in the fly brain and to determine if the protein exhibits rhythmic changes in abundance within clock cells using immunostaining methods with whole mounts of the adult brain. However, neither anti-S6KII (Kim et al., 2006) nor anti-pS6KII antisera revealed obvious signals within the clock neuronal circuitry of wild-type flies. Thus, another antibody or different conditions might be required to determine the S6KII spatial expression pattern.To determine whether the elimination of S6KII activity disrupts circadian behavior, we analyzed locomotor activity rhythms in an  null mutant [\u0394, hereafter called ]. This mutant was generated by imprecise excision of a  transposable element; it is known to be a viable protein null that exhibits deficits in learning and memory (Putz et al., 2004); hence, the name  (). As shown in Figure 2 and Table 1, the  null allele is associated with short circadian periods for the locomotor activity rhythm; average periods for this mutant were at least 1 h shorter than those observed in control flies.The  mutant has a short-period behavioral rhythm which can be rescued by expression of the wild-type gene in clock neurons. Panels show representative actograms from single flies of the indicated genotypes. Each genotype was examined in at least three independent experiments. The black and white rectangles above the actograms represent the light/dark cycle to which flies were entrained; placement of the light/dark bars in the first and last panels differs from the others simply because the activity data were saved at different times of day in those experiments. Flies were entrained to 12 h light/dark (LD) for 3\u20134 d and then maintained in constant darkness (DD) for a period of at least 10 d.  is a null allele of the gene.  is the control strain carrying the insertion from which the  mutant was derived.  and  indicate the  and  drivers, respectively; + represents a + transgene. Results for other control genotypes are shown in Table 1.Period estimates and sample sizes for  mutants and other genotypesCircadian period is known to be temperature compensated although it varies across a physiological range of temperatures. We systematically compared circadian period in the  mutant and wild type at 20\u00b0C, 25\u00b0C and 29\u00b0C. Period was reasonably compensated in the mutant with the difference between genotypes being most apparent at 20\u00b0C (a temperature at which there was an approximate 1.2 h difference between the two genotypes) (Table 1). However, whereas circadian period became shorter in an + control strain () with increasing temperature, consistent with published results (Konopka et al., 1989), it became longer in the mutant and therefore the difference between genotypes was less pronounced at 29\u00b0C. We do not understand the significance of the slightly anomalous compensation of the mutant.In the mammalian suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), phosphorylation of RSK1 can be regulated by the clock (via the clock control of MAPK signaling; (Obrietan and Impey, 1998) or by light (Butcher et al., 2004). Light induces both phosphorylation of RSK1 and its translocation to the nuclei of SCN cells (Butcher et al., 2004). Interestingly, the light-induced phosphorylation of RSK1 is restricted to the night portion of the cycle, similar to what has been documented for MAPK pathway activation (Obrietan and Impey, 1998), indicative of a role in light resetting of the clock. Thus, we were interested in whether fly S6KII might have a similar role in light resetting. To address this question, we examined light-induced phase delays and advances in  and control flies. In two different experiments, we found no evidence of diminished light responses in the mutant. In one experiment, the average advances were 1.9 \u00b1 0.3 h ( = 32 flies), 1.3 \u00b1 0.31 h ( = 27) and 1.7 \u00b1 0.26 h ( = 20) for , the control  strain and  flies, respectively, whereas average delays were \u22123.8 \u00b1 0.26 h ( = 42), \u22122.8 \u00b1 0.36 h ( = 27) and \u22123.4 \u00b1 0.24 h ( = 30) for the three types of flies, respectively. This set of light-resetting experiments was repeated with similar results (data not shown). Thus, light resetting appears to be normal in  flies, although there might be an effect of the mutation at lower light fluences (our experiments used 1 min pulses of white fluorescent light at a fluence of \u223c8 \u03bcmol m\u22122 s\u22121).To show that the short-period phenotype of  flies is due to a lesion in the  gene, we generated flies carrying one of three different wild-type + genomic transgene insertions (Putz et al., 2004). Table 1 shows that one of these insertions () rescued the circadian period phenotype; the other two insertions did not rescue behavior (data not shown). In ;  flies, S6KII protein amount is comparable with that of the wild type, whereas protein amounts are less in other transgenic lines that failed to show evidence of rescue (Putz et al., 2004)(data not shown). Finally, we note that increasing + gene dosage in a wild-type background (in /Y;/+ flies) had no effect on circadian period (Table 1), demonstrating that S6KII activity is not rate limiting for the modulation of period.We wished to determine where S6KII function is required within clock neurons for the regulation of locomotor activity rhythms. The neural pattern of S6KII localization is unknown, because the existing S6KII antibody has not worked for immunostaining of wild-type brains. Thus, to address this question, we attempted rescue of the null mutant by driving expression of a UAS-S6KII+ transgene (Rintelen et al., 2001) with different cell-type-specific Gal4 transgenes. Expression of S6KII in TIM-containing clock cells (using tim-Gal4 or tim-UAS-Gal4) or PDF clock cells (using pdf-Gal4) restored near normal circadian periods to mutants (Fig. 2, Table 1). These results demonstrate that S6KII expression within PDF clock cells is sufficient for normal behavioral rhythmicity. Similar to the results with a genomic transgene (see above), increased S6KII+ dosage in a wild-type background, ;  flies, had no effect on circadian period (Table 1).Although we could not detect S6KII in wild-type fly brains (see above), using an existing antibody (Kim et al., 2006), we wondered whether it might be possible to detect the protein in flies overexpressing the protein. Thus, we performed immunostaining experiments using the anti-S6KII antibody and brains from adult  flies. As shown in Figure 3, pdf-Gal4-driven overexpression permitted detection of S6KII within the large and small PDF-containing LNv neurons. In these conditions, the protein had a predominantly cytoplasmic localization, as seen by comparison of the S6KII signal (red) to that for PDF (green). Moreover, there was a constitutively high, nonoscillating level of S6KII in such flies, the expected result as the pdf promoter is not regulated in a circadian manner (Park and Hall, 1998). As pdf-Gal4-driven S6KII can rescue circadian period (Fig. 2, Table 1), this result indicates that rhythmic changes in S6KII abundance are not required for the manifestation of normal circadian behavior.Pdf-Gal4 drives constitutive expression of S6KII in clock cells. Top and bottom show PDF (green) and S6KII (red) immunoreactive signals, respectively, at ZT 1 and ZT 10 in pdf-Gal4; UAS-S6KII flies. S6KII could not be detected in the  mutant, similar to results with wild-type flies (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Six brains were examined at each time point in these experiments, with similar results. See Materials and Methods for details about immunostaining procedures.Our behavioral experiments showed that tim-Gal4- and tim-UAS-Gal4-driven S6KII also rescued circadian period (Fig. 2, Table 1). It is known from many published studies that the tim-Gal4 driver expresses Gal4 activity according to a circadian rhythm that reflects the endogenous tim promoter. In contrast, it has previously been shown that tim-UAS-Gal4 drives low-amplitude (\u223c3-fold) rhythms in Gal4 activity (Blau and Young, 1999) that are anti-phase to the normal  rhythm and in phase with the  RNA rhythm (Fig. 1). Indeed, we examined S6KII abundance in tim-UAS-Gal4; UAS-S6KII brains and detected an approximate threefold change in abundance between ZT1.5 and ZT10 within the large and small PDF-positive LNvs (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), similar to the expression profile documented for  in tim-UAS-Gal4; UAS-vrille flies (Blau and Young, 1999). Thus, tim-Gal4 and tim-UAS-Gal4 drive expression with opposite phases whereas pdf-Gal4 results in constitutive expression. The observation that pdf-Gal4, tim-Gal4 and tim-UAS-Gal4 can all rescue the circadian period phenotype of  demonstrates that constitutive expression, normally phased expression or anti-phase expression of S6KII are equally sufficient for normal behavioral rhythmicity. If rhythms in S6KII  are required for normal behavior, then they might come about via rhythmic post-translational modification(s) of the protein, similar to those observed for the  CLK protein (Yu et al., 2006).The short-period locomotor activity rhythm phenotype of  flies suggests that S6KII alters the circadian molecular oscillator. To assess oscillator function, we examined rhythmicity of the clock component  (). It is known that PER is highly phosphorylated and most abundant in the late night and early morning. At such times (ZT16, ZT20, ZT0 and ZT4),  fly head extracts had abnormally high levels of PER, relative to control flies (Fig. 4, data not shown). Increased PER immunoreactivity, indicative of abundance, was evident in the PDF neurons and perhaps other cell types of the mutant as assessed by immunostaining (Fig. 4), consistent with the idea that S6KII is required within pacemaker cells for normal oscillator function. Changes in PER abundance were most noticeable near the end of night (ZT20 and ZT0) when PER is nuclear and strongly represses clock gene transcription. Consistent with an effect on repression, Q-PCR analysis of  mRNA demonstrated that  mRNA level was decreased in  flies at most times of day in DD conditions (Fig. 4). Whereas this effect was observed at certain times of day in LD, it was most pronounced in DD and seen in three independent experiments (Fig. 4, data not shown). Increased PER protein and decreased  message levels in the  mutant indicate that the clock protein has enhanced stability, perhaps due to altered phosphorylation, and that this results in increased feedback repression.PER clock protein and  gene expression are altered in the  mutant. , PER is abnormally high in 58-1 head extracts at Zeitgeber times (ZT) 20 and 0. Blots were probed with a rabbit anti-PER antibody, stripped and then reprobed with rat anti-N-cadherin as a loading control. The blot shown is representative of three biological replicates. Histograms represent densitometric measurements minus background and normalized to N-cadherin (mean \u00b1 SEM). At both times of day, the mean PER signal is statistically different between the mutant and control ( < 0.02, Welch's  test). , PER immunoreactivity is increased within the PDF-positive large and small LNv neurons and perhaps other cell types of the  mutant relative to controls (). PER immunoreactive signals were blindly ranked on a scale of 1\u20135, with 5 being the most intense signal, and the panels shown here are representative results. The  panel shown in this figure received a score of 2, the average for this genotype, whereas the  panel was ranked a 4, the average for the mutant. Images represent a series of collapsed 1 \u03bcm sections. This experiment was repeated three times with similar results. ,  mRNA titers are reduced in 58-1 flies. This plot is representative of three biological replicates, each repeated in triplicate. Ct values were normalized to those of the noncycling housekeeping gene . Data points are means \u00b1 SEM of each triplicate.To determine whether decreased S6KII affected -gene transcription, we performed gene reporter assays using cultured S2 cells expressing an E-box-luciferase reporter transgene (see Methods). We used RNAi techniques to knock down S6KII in S2 cells and monitored PER feedback repression in this system. As a control, we performed a cell-based knockdown of CK2\u03b1, similar to that reported by Nawathean and Rosbash (2004). We found that S2 cells endogenously express  mRNA and that incubation of cells with -specific dsRNA reduced the level of the message to \u223c30% of normal ( value = 0.003; Welch's two-sample, one-sided  test); a similar level of RNAi knockdown was previously reported for \u03b1 using dsRNA specific for that message (Nawathean and Rosbash, 2004). In contrast, S6KII knockdown was associated with increased PER feedback repression, as shown by a decrease in normalized luciferase activity (Fig. 5). These data are consistent with the results described above that demonstrate reduced  mRNA levels in  flies. The opposite effects of CK2\u03b1 and S6KII knockdown in cell-based assays are correlated with behavioral results showing long- and short-period circadian activity rhythms, respectively, in the two types of mutants.Decreased S6KII is associated with increased PER-mediated repression. Histogram plots showing percentage changes in luciferase activity, reflecting differences in PER feedback repression (mean \u00b1 SEM). S6KII and CK2\u03b1 knockdown results were normalized by plotting each as a percentage of the no RNAi control. These results represent data from four independent experiments; in each experiment, PER repression was increased with S6KII knockdown and decreased with CK2\u03b1 knockdown. Normalized values of luciferase activity, expressed as the number of SDs from the mean (see Materials and Methods), were analyzed to statistically evaluate differences among the three conditions. According to that analysis, the distributions for S6KII and CK2\u03b1 knockdowns are significantly different from each other and from that for the No RNAi control ( \u2264 0.002, Welch's two-tailed  test).It is known that CK2 is enriched in the PDF clock cells of the adult fly brain (J. M. Lin et al., 2002; Akten et al., 2003), and required in those cells for normal behavioral rhythmicity (Smith et al., 2008) (V. Sundram and F. R. Jackson, unpublished results). In addition, an interaction between human RSK and the casein kinase 2 regulatory subunit (CK2\u03b2) was previously detected in a yeast two-hybrid screen (Kusk et al., 1999). We have identified an interaction between  S6KII and CK2\u03b2 in cell-based assays performed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 6). When plasmids encoding HA-tagged CK2\u03b2 and Myc-tagged S6KII were transfected into HEK293 cells, the two proteins could be coimmunoprecipitated using an anti-HA antibody. As a positive control, CK2\u03b2 could also immunoprecipitate CK2\u03b1, the catalytic subunit of CK2 (Fig. 6). CK2\u03b1 phosphorylates CK2\u03b2 at three N-terminal serine residues, which results in an increase in molecular weight. It is interesting to note that in the presence of CK2\u03b1, CK2\u03b2 was detected as a doublet of bands, indicating a high degree of phosphorylation. In contrast, coexpression of CK2\u03b2 with S6KII did not result in the appearance of a slower migrating CK2\u03b2 protein, indicating that S6KII does not phosphorylate CK2\u03b2.Interaction of S6KII with CK2\u03b2. MYC-S6KII or MYC-CK2\u03b1 were either individually transfected in HEK293 cells (lanes 1 and 4) or in combination with HA-CK2\u03b2 (lanes 2 and 5) or HA-CK2\u03b2C109,114S (lanes 3 and 6). Immunoprecipitations (IP) were done with an anti-HA antibody and purified protein complexes were analyzed by Western blot (WB) with anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies. Expression of MYC-S6KII and MYC-CK2\u03b1 in all samples was confirmed by Western blot analysis of total cell lysates.Another apparent difference between CK2\u03b1 and S6KII is the mode of interaction with CK2\u03b2. Assembly of the heterotetrameric CK2 (\u03b12\u03b22) holoenzyme requires dimer formation between two CK2\u03b2 molecules, which is mediated by a zinc finger structure (Chantalat et al., 1999; Niefind et al., 2001). A mutant form of CK2\u03b2, in which two cysteine residues within the zinc finger structure were changed to serine residues (CK2\u03b2C109,114S), was unable to interact with CK2\u03b1 (Fig. 6). Consistent with a lack of phosphorylation in the absence of CK2\u03b1, the CK2\u03b2 was present only as a single band. Interestingly, S6KII could be precipitated by the dimerization defective CK2\u03b2C109,114S protein (Fig. 6).Based on the observation that S6KII and CK2\u03b2 can physically interact, we sought genetic evidence for an interaction . Thus, we analyzed behavioral rhythms in double mutants carrying  and ;  behaves similar to a hypomorphic allele of the essential CK2\u03b2 gene whereas  is a null allele of  We reasoned that genetic epistasis might be observed if CK2\u03b2 and S6KII cooperate . Alternatively, if the two proteins function in different pathways, then the double mutant is expected to have an intermediate phenotype; i.e., a near wild-type circadian period). As shown in Table 1, double mutants had long-period rhythms, similar to , and this result indicates that CK2\u03b2 and S6KII interact . Similarly, ;  (a CK2\u03b1 allele; (J. M. Lin et al., 2002) had long-period rhythms although they were slightly shorter than those of  single mutants (Table 1). These results are consistent with the idea that S6KII function requires normal CK2 activity.We have shown that a null mutant for  () exhibits a short-period locomotor activity rhythm, indicating a requirement for the kinase in the molecular oscillator. Consistent with such a role,  mRNA shows circadian oscillations in abundance. Although we cannot detect rhythms in S6KII protein abundance or activation (by phosphorylation) within clock neurons using currently available reagents, these remain possibilities as a mechanism for producing rhythms in kinase activity. Alternatively, constitutive expression of S6KII may be sufficient for normal behavior, similar to the case for other circadian kinases. To our knowledge, S6KII represents the first nonessential kinase or phosphatase with a post-transcriptional role in regulating the circadian molecular oscillator. Null mutants of  (CKI\u03b5),  (GSK-3\u03b2), PP2A, or \u03b1/\u03b2 arrest in development during embryonic or larval stages (Bourouis et al., 1989; Jursnich et al., 1990; Jauch et al., 2002; Sathyanarayanan et al., 2004).We have shown that S6KII can physically interact with the CK2\u03b2 subunit in cultured cells and that there are genetic interactions between mutations affecting the two kinases . This study provides the first evidence for an interaction between kinases, , that regulates circadian period. Both CK2 and S6KII are required within clock cells for normal circadian period, consistent with a model wherein they cooperate to regulate molecular oscillator function. Previous studies have suggested a functional interaction between CK2 and the Dbt (CK1\u03b5) kinase, using cell-based assays with the two kinases (Nawathean and Rosbash, 2004), but there is no evidence supporting such an interaction . Although we do not know the targets that are relevant for S6KII function, a likely possibility is regulation of PER phosphorylation via the CK2 kinase (Lin et al., 2005), based on the interaction between S6KII and CK2. As  and  mutants have opposite circadian period phenotypes, S6KII binding may inhibit CK2 activity to modulate the PER-mediated repression of clock gene transcription. Consistent with such a downstream and opposing role, CK2 overexpression in the fly eye suppresses a S6KII-generated overexpression phenotype (MMT, BA and FRJ unpublished results).Regarding a role for S6KII in modulating PER phosphorylation, we point out that our results are entirely consistent with previous studies that postulate a role for CK2 in regulating PER-mediated repression (Nawathean and Rosbash, 2004; Smith et al., 2008). Cell-based -reporter studies performed by Nawathean and Rosbash (2004) showed that knockdown of CK2 resulted in  PER repressor activity, and we have replicated these findings on CK2 in our analysis of S6KII. Our results show that knockdown of S6KII in such cell-based reporter assays is associated with  PER-mediated repression, consistent with the hypothesis that wild-type S6KII inhibits CK2 activity. The analysis of  RNA in the  mutant shows a reduced abundance, consistent with increased PER repression. Smith et al. (2008) have recently shown that overexpression of a CK2\u03b1 dominant-negative mutant subunit (CK2\u03b1tik) causes increased  RNA abundance that is associated with constitutively high PER, a delayed nuclear entry for the clock protein and long-period rhythmicity, effects that are consistent with decreased PER repression.  mRNA abundance is also abnormally high in a mutant () of the CK2\u03b2 subunit (B. Akten and F. R. Jackson, unpublished results), consistent with decreased repression. The aggregate of all these results strongly supports a role for CK2 in modulating PER-mediated repression and an inhibitory function for S6KII in this process. Although our results indicate that S6KII may act through CK2 to regulate PER phosphorylation, it is also possible that the two kinases intersect on a common target (PER?) with CK2 phosphorylation of the target being required for S6KII biochemical action.RSK1, the mammalian S6KII homolog, is phosphorylated in a clock-dependent manner (Butcher et al., 2004). Although we have not been able to detect rhythmic phosphorylation of S6KII with available reagents, this remains a formal possibility as there are many known RSK1 sites of phosphorylation, including those for PDK1 and ERK/MAPK, conserved in the fly S6KII sequence. We lack reagents to determine whether the phosphorylation status and nuclear entry of fly S6KII is gated in a light-dependent manner, similar to its mammalian counterpart, but there is no evidence from an analysis of an  mutant for an alteration of light-dependent clock resetting behavior. Based on the results reported here, we think that the primary function of fly S6KII is to regulate the period of the circadian oscillator via interaction with CK2 and modulation of PER phosphorylation (Lin et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2008).It is known that mammalian RSK1 can be phosphorylated in a MAPK-dependent manner. Although we have not yet looked for interactions between the S6KII and MAPK pathways, it has recently been reported that  S6KII functions in the MAPK pathway to determine photoreceptor development (Kim et al., 2006). In addition, a previous study (Williams et al., 2001) concluded that MAPK signaling represents a component of the circadian output pathway regulating locomotor activity. Moreover, studies of the mammalian SCN have shown that MAPK activity is important for resetting and/or for robust cycling of the molecular oscillator (Obrietan et al., 1998; Akashi and Nishida, 2000; Coogan and Piggins, 2003; Akashi et al., 2008). Thus, it will be of interest to determine the connection between the MAPK pathway and S6KII in clock function.Figure 7 shows our working model for a S6KII\u2013CK2 feedback loop which we postulate modulates circadian period. As illustrated in this model, there is clock regulation of  mRNA levels. Given the  RNA cycle, we think it is likely that there is rhythmic S6KII protein production, and/or perhaps rhythmic activation of the kinase, in certain neurons although constitutive S6KII abundance is sufficient for normal behavior. Based on physical and genetic interactions, we hypothesize that S6KII negatively regulates CK2 action, and that this may result in oscillations of CK2 activity within clock neurons; at present, it is impossible to specify the phasing of such a rhythm without knowing more about the regulation of S6KII activity. Our results indicate that changes in S6KII amount might regulate PER phosphorylation via CK2. In support of an effect on PER, we have shown that peak PER protein level is abnormally high in the  mutant at certain times of day and that  RNA titer is decreased, in particular in DD conditions. Abnormally high levels of nuclear phospho-PER in the  mutant together with decreased  mRNA levels are consistent with the idea that a post-translational modification of PER results in enhanced -gene repression. Our results from the use of cell-based assays support the idea that decreased S6KII results in increased PER-based repression. As a consequence, the repression phase of the molecular cycle may be abbreviated resulting in a short-period molecular oscillator. Of note, results from another recent study indicate that increased  transcription, rather than increased repression, can also shorten the period of the fly molecular oscillator (Kadener et al., 2008), consistent with the idea that altering either the transcription or repression phases can shorten circadian period.Hypothetical model for an S6KII/CK2 feedback loop.  transcription and presumably S6KII protein abundance are regulated in a circadian manner. We hypothesize that binding of S6KII to CK2\u03b2 inhibits CK2 activity thus altering PER phosphorylation and molecular oscillator function. As S6KII is known to have other targets, it is also possible that the kinase regulates oscillator function through another pathway (indicated in the model by the arrows and question mark).It is of interest to compare our hypothesis for the action of S6KII, in the control of PER activity, to that recently elaborated for the fly Dbt kinase (Kivimae et al., 2008). The studies of Kivimae et al. show that Dbt phosphorylation of two distinct sites within PER inversely affect stability and repressor activity of the clock protein. For example, Dbt phosphorylation of PER in the \u201cper-short\u201d region stabilizes the protein while decreasing its potency as a repressor. In contrast, our results suggest that a deficit for S6KII, and presumably altered CK2 activity, produces a PER protein with increased stability and normal or enhanced repressor activity. Notably, Dbt and CK2 phosphorylation sites have been mapped to within short overlapping N-terminal regions of PER (Lin et al., 2005; Kivimae et al., 2008) and it is possible that there is interaction between the kinases in modifying the clock protein. The precise role of S6KII in regulating CK2 or another component of the molecular oscillator will only be revealed through detailed biochemical analysis of its function.This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) Grant R01 NS45817 to F.R.J., National Science Foundation Fellowship DGE 0238731 to M.M.T., a grant from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (SFB581/B14) to T.R., and a center grant to the Tufts Center for Neuroscience Research (NIH P30 NS047243; PI; F.R.J.).

Glucocorticoids suppress synaptic glutamate release via the retrograde release of endocannabinoids and facilitate synaptic GABA release via an unknown retrograde messenger. Here, we show that the glucocorticoid facilitation of GABA inputs is due to the retrograde release of neuronal nitric oxide and that glucocorticoid-induced endocannabinoid synthesis and nitric oxide synthesis are mediated by divergent G-protein signaling mechanisms. While the glucocorticoid-induced, endocannabinoid-mediated suppression of glutamate release is dependent on activation of the G\u03b1s G-protein subunit and cAMP\u2013cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation, the nitric oxide facilitation of GABA release is mediated by G\u03b2\u03b3 signaling that leads to activation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase. Our findings indicate, therefore, that glucocorticoids exert opposing rapid actions on glutamate and GABA release by activating divergent G-protein signaling pathways that trigger the synthesis of, and glutamate and GABA synapse-specific retrograde actions of, endocannabinoids and nitric oxide, respectively. The simultaneous rapid stimulation of nitric oxide and endocannabinoid synthesis by glucocorticoids has important implications for the impact of stress on the brain as well as on neural-immune interactions in the hypothalamus.Glucocorticoids are adrenocorticosteroid hormones that are secreted in response to activation of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis in a circadian pattern under baseline conditions and at high levels as part of the physiological response to stress. Glucocorticoids exert negative feedback effects on HPA axis activation via both rapid and delayed inhibitory actions at the level of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), the pituitary and the hippocampus (Sapolsky et al., 1990). In addition to these negative feedback effects, glucocorticoids also regulate other neuroendocrine systems, including the hypothalamic-neurohypophysial system responsible for the secretion of the neuropeptides vasopressin and oxytocin from magnocellular neurons of the PVN and hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON) (de Kloet, 2000).In addition to the classical actions of glucocorticoids responsible for the delayed transcriptional effects that are mediated by the known intracellular corticosteroid receptors and genomic regulation, there is increasing evidence for rapid glucocorticoid actions triggered by the activation of membrane-associated receptors and nongenomic signaling mechanisms (de Kloet, 2000; Haller et al., 2008; Tasker et al., 2006). Our recent studies suggest that glucocorticoids elicit a rapid suppression of glutamatergic excitatory synaptic inputs to neuroendocrine cells of the PVN and SON via the activation of a postsynaptic, membrane-associated receptor and the G-protein-dependent synthesis of retrograde endocannabinoid messengers (Di et al., 2003, 2005b). The glucocorticoid-induced endocannabinoid synthesis is dependent on the G\u03b1s G-protein subunit and the cAMP\u2013cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) signaling pathway (Malcher-Lopes et al., 2006). We also found that glucocorticoids elicit an opposite action on GABA synapses in hypothalamic magnocellular neurons, leading to a facilitation of GABA release via the postsynaptic, G-protein-dependent synthesis of an unknown retrograde messenger (Di et al., 2005b) (for review, see Di and Tasker, 2008).In the present study, we determined that the glucocorticoid facilitation of GABA release is not dependent on the G\u03b1s-cAMP\u2013PKA pathway, but is caused by the G\u03b2\u03b3-mediated activation of neuronal nitric oxide (NO) synthase and the synthesis of NO. We show, therefore, that glucocorticoids activate divergent G-protein signaling pathways, via the G\u03b1s and G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits, respectively, to produce different retrograde messengers, endocannabinoids and NO, which each act in a synapse-specific manner to suppress excitatory synaptic inputs and facilitate inhibitory synaptic inputs, respectively. This glucocorticoid-induced suppression of synaptic excitation and facilitation of synaptic inhibition in the same cells would be expected to cause a rapid functional inhibition of the magnocellular neuroendocrine systems during the stress response.Male Sprague Dawley rats (4\u20136 weeks old, Charles River) were used in these experiments according to a protocol approved by the Tulane University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Hypothalamic slices containing the SON were prepared as described previously (Di et al., 2003). Briefly, rats were decapitated under deep halothane anesthesia and the brain was quickly removed and submerged in a cooled (\u223c1\u00b0C), oxygenated modified artificial CSF (aCSF), in which NaCl was replaced by an equimolar concentration of sucrose, which was used to improve neuronal viability. The standard aCSF contained the following (in mm): 140 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.3 MgSO4, 1.4 NaH2PO4, 2.4 CaCl2, 11 glucose, and 5 HEPES, bubbled with 100% O2. The hypothalamus was then blocked and, in the same ice-cold, oxygenated, modified aCSF, two coronal hypothalamic slices (300 \u03bcm) containing the SON were sectioned and bisected along the midline (i.e., at the third ventricle). The hemi-slices were maintained submerged in a holding chamber in oxygenated standard aCSF at room temperature for \u22651.5 h before being transferred to a submersion recording chamber on a fixed-stage upright microscope (Olympus; BX50WI).Following a 15 min equilibration period in the recording chamber, the slices were visualized using infrared illumination and differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) optics, and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed at 32\u201334\u00b0C using electrodes with a tip resistance of 3\u20134 M\u03a9. The Pipette solution used to record EPSCs contained (in mm) 120 K-gluconate, 10 KCl, 1 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, and 10 HEPES. The internal solution used to record IPSCs contained either (in mm) 110 d-gluconic acid, 110 CsOH, 10 CsCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, and 10 HEPES; or 120 CsCl, 2 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 11 EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, and 30 HEPES. The latter solution was used for the majority of recordings of IPSCs to reverse the GABAA receptor-mediated currents and increase the Cl\u2212 driving force. All recordings were performed in voltage-clamp mode using a Multiclamp 700 amplifier and pCLAMP 9 software (Molecular Devices). Data were low-pass filtered at 2 kHz, digitized at 5\u201310 kHz and recorded for off-line analysis. To isolate miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs), tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 \u03bcm) was added to the aCSF to block spike-mediated transmitter release, and 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX; 20 \u03bcm) and d-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5; 50 \u03bcm) were included to block ionotropic glutamate receptor-mediated synaptic currents. To isolate miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs), TTX (1 \u03bcm) and the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline methiodide (10 \u03bcm) were added to the aCSF. Magnocellular neurons were voltage clamped at either 0 mV or \u221260 mV (with the high [Cl\u2212]-containing patch solution) to record IPSCs and at \u221260 mV to record EPSCs. To focus on the fast, nongenomic actions of glucocorticoids, 3-min epochs of mIPSCs and mEPSCs were recorded at 7\u201310 min of steroid treatment and were compared with 3-min control epochs acquired just before the treatment; mIPSCs and mEPSCs were analyzed for changes in mean frequency, peak amplitude and decay time (defined as the time from peak to 63% decay of the PSCs) using the Minianalysis 6.0 program (Synaptosoft).Evoked synaptic responses were elicited by stimulation (0.2\u20130.5 mA, 0.25 ms, 0.05 Hz) with a concentric bipolar electrode placed just dorsal-medial to the SON. Evoked IPSCs (eIPSCs) were recorded in the presence of DNQX (20 \u03bcm) and AP-5 (50 \u03bcm), and evoked EPSCs (eEPSCs) were recorded in the presence of picrotoxin (50 \u03bcm). Mean ePSC amplitudes recorded at 50\u201370% of maximal amplitude were compared under baseline conditions (3 min before drug treatment) and at 7\u201310 min of drug application. Evoked IPSCs were also confirmed as GABA-dependent by their blockade with the GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin (50 \u03bcm).Magnocellular neurons were identified visually by their relatively large somatic size and their position in the SON under IR-DIC visualization. In a few cells, intracellular labeling with biocytin and  immunohistochemical double labeling with antisera to oxytocin- and vasopressin-associated neurophysins were performed to identify oxytocinergic and vasopressinergic subpopulations of the SON. Since the few identified oxytocin neurons ( = 2) and vasopressin neurons ( = 2) showed similar responses, and the majority of unidentified cells, which were recorded randomly throughout the SON, i.e., with an equal probability of sampling from oxytocinergic and vasopressinergic subpopulations, also responded in a similar manner to dexamethasone (Dex), data from all magnocellular neurons were pooled for analysis.Magnocellular neurons were loaded individually with an NO-sensitive dye, 4-amino-5-methylamino-2\u2032,7\u2032-difluorofluorescein (DAF-FM; 21 \u03bcm; Invitrogen), via the patch pipette. The patch solution was the same as that used to quantify IPSCs, except that the EGTA was replaced by 0.1 mm bis-fura-2. The bath contained DNQX (20 \u03bcm) and AP-5 (50 \u03bcm) to block glutamate receptors, and dexamethasone (1 \u03bcm) and/or l-NAME (50 \u03bcm) was applied in the bath during the course of the experiment. Images were recorded at 1 s intervals with a QuantEM:512c camera (Photometrics) in EM gain mode using IP-lab 4.0 software. The magnocellular neuron soma was defined as the region of interest (ROI) with the software and was excited at 488 nm with a DG4 (Sutter) xenon light source for 100 ms of each 1 s cycle, and emitted light was filtered through a 510\u2013550 nm bandpass filter.Images were analyzed off line with Image J (NIH) using the Time Series Analyzer's recentering plugin to correct for slight translations in cell position during recording. Background fluorescence was subtracted from a similarly sized ROI adjacent to the cell. Mean somatic fluorescence intensity for each time point (F) was divided by the average intensity of a 3-min stable baseline period just before treatment with drugs (0), and multiplied by 100% to give the percentage change from baseline, \u0394/0 (%). For presentation, each minute of data was averaged for each cell, then averaged for all cells within a treatment group and plotted (\u00b1SEM).We used the water-soluble form of dexamethasone ((2-hydroxypropyl)-\u03b2-cyclodextrin-conjugated dexamethasone) (Sigma-Aldrich) for these experiments. We have characterized the effects of dexamethasone and corticosterone in previous studies and found them to have similar effects (Di et al., 2005b). The EC50 of dexamethasone is \u223c500 nm; here we used a saturating dose of dexamethasone, 1 \u03bcm. The following drugs were stored as stock solutions at \u221220\u00b0C and were dissolved to their final concentrations in aCSF before their application in the bath perfusion, including TTX (Sigma-Aldrich), the glutamate receptor antagonists DNQX and AP-5 (Tocris), leptin (Sigma), the CB1 receptor antagonists 2050 (Tocris) and SR141716 (kindly provided by the NIMH Chemical Synthesis and Drug Supply Program), the NO precursor l-arginine and the NO donor SNAP (-nitroso--acetylpenicillamine), the nonselective NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor l-NAME (N\u03c9-Nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride) and the selective neuronal NOS (nNOS) inhibitor propyl-l-arginine (NPLA) (Tocris), and the myristoylated G-protein \u03b2\u03b3-binding peptide, mSIRK (myr-SIRKALNILGYPDYD-OH) and its negative control mSIRK(L9A) (myr-SIRKALNIAGYPDYD-OH) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The nonhydrolyzable guanylyl nucleotide GDP-\u03b2-S (Sigma-Aldrich), the cAMP\u2013PKA antagonist ()-adenosine, cyclic 3\u2032, 5\u2032-(hydrogenphosphorothioate) triethylammonium (cAMPS-Rp) (Tocris), and the G\u03b1s and G\u03b2 polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were included in the patch solution for intracellular application.All data are expressed as means \u00b1 SEs. Statistical comparisons of electrophysiological data were performed using the Student's paired  test for within-group cell comparisons and the Student's unpaired  test for between-group comparisons. The one-way repeated measures ANOVA was used for multiple comparisons and followed by the Student-Newman\u2013Keuls test as needed. Probability values <0.05 were considered significant for all comparisons.Bath application of the synthetic glucocorticoid agonist Dex (1 \u03bcm) caused an increase in the amplitude of IPSCs evoked by electrical stimulation (eIPSCs) in 7 of 7 SON neurons tested (134.7 \u00b1 37.9% of baseline;  < 0.05;  = 7). In contrast, Dex (1 \u03bcm) caused a decrease in the amplitude of eEPSCs in 5 of 6 SON neurons tested (75.8 \u00b1 3.3% of baseline;  < 0.05;  = 5) (Fig. 1,). Dexamethasone (1 \u03bcm) also caused an increase in the frequency of mIPSCs (127.1 \u00b1 5.9% of baseline;  < 0.01;  = 6) within 3\u20135 min of introduction into the bath perfusion, without affecting mIPSC amplitude or decay time (Fig. 1,). Dex (1 \u03bcm) caused a significant decrease in the frequency of mEPSCs (65.6 \u00b1 11.4% of baseline;  < 0.05;  = 7) without affecting mEPSC amplitude or decay time (data not shown). This confirmed our previous findings of glucocorticoid facilitation of presynaptic GABA release and suppression of glutamate release (Di et al., 2005b).Opposing rapid actions of glucocorticoids on glutamate and GABA release onto magnocellular neurons. , Dex (1 \u03bcm) caused an increase in the amplitude of evoked IPSCs and a decrease in the amplitude of evoked EPSCs. Traces are averages of 7\u20139 consecutive evoked PSCs over 3 min before and after 7 min of Dex application. GABA currents are inward due to high intracellular [Cl\u2212] (see Materials and Methods). , Histogram of mean evoked IPSC and EPSC amplitudes (Amp) before and after 7 min of Dex (1 \u03bcm).

Lower inset traces are time expanded from designated segments of upper traces. GABA currents are outward. , Normalized running average (1 min bin width) of mIPSC frequency (Freq), amplitude, and decay time ( = 6). Dexamethasone induced a rapid increase in mIPSC frequency, but had no effect on mIPSC amplitude and decay time.We previously reported paradoxical findings that glucocorticoid facilitation of GABA release was blocked by the selective CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 (1 \u03bcm), but it was not mimicked by the CB1 receptor agonists WIN 55,212-2, anandamide or arachidonoylglycerol (Di et al., 2005b), indicating an AM251-sensitive, cannabinoid-insensitive mechanism. Here, we tested two other selective CB1 antagonists, SR141716 and 2050, on the glucocorticoid-induced facilitation of GABA release. Bath application of SR141716 (1 \u03bcm) increased the basal frequency of mIPSCs to 115.0 \u00b1 5.6% of baseline ( < 0.05;  = 6), but failed to block the glucocorticoid effect, since subsequent bath application of Dex (1 \u03bcm) in the presence of SR141716 further increased the mIPSC frequency to 131.3 \u00b1 6.3% compared with baseline ( < 0.01) and to 114.2 \u00b1 1.2% compared with the frequency in SR141716 ( < 0.01;  = 6) (Fig. 2). Bath application of 2050 (1 \u03bcm) showed a similar effect, increasing basal mIPSC frequency to 114.9 \u00b1 5.0% of baseline ( < 0.05;  = 5) and failing to block the Dex-induced increase in mIPSC frequency (128.0 \u00b1 7.4% vs baseline;  < 0.01; 112.6 \u00b1 3.9% vs 2050;  < 0.05;  = 5) (Fig. 2). These results indicate that the glucocorticoid-induced facilitation of GABA release is mediated by an endocannabinoid-independent mechanism, and suggest that AM251 has nonspecific actions on glucocorticoid-induced GABA release that do not depend on CB1 activation.Glucocorticoid effect on GABA synaptic inputs was not mediated by endocannabinoids. Summary histograms show the mIPSC frequency (Freq) response to Dex in the presence of cannabinoid receptor antagonists. The CB1 antagonists SR141716 (1 \u03bcm) and 2050 (1 \u03bcm) failed to inhibit the Dex-induced increase in mIPSC frequency. The CB1 antagonists increased the basal mIPSC frequency, suggesting an endocannabinoid inhibitory tone on GABA release.For the purpose of comparison, we repeated previous experiments to confirm the sensitivity of the glucocorticoid-induced suppression of synaptic excitation to blockade of CB1 receptors (Di et al., 2005b). Bath application of the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716 (1 \u03bcm) abolished the Dex-induced decrease in mEPSC frequency (data not shown). Our results show, therefore, that unlike the glucocorticoid-induced suppression of glutamate release, the glucocorticoid-induced facilitation of GABA release is not mediated by an endocannabinoid-dependent mechanism.We showed previously that both the rapid glucocorticoid-induced facilitation of synaptic inhibition and the rapid glucocorticoid-induced suppression of synaptic excitation in magnocellular neurons are mediated by the activation of one or more membrane-associated glucocorticoid receptors (Di et al., 2005b). Both effects are dependent on G-protein activation, since they are abolished by blocking postsynaptic G-protein activity. We also showed that the glucocorticoid-induced suppression of glutamate release is mediated by activation of a Gs-cAMP\u2013PKA signaling pathway (Malcher-Lopes et al., 2006). Here, we determined whether the opposing action of glucocorticoids on GABA release relies on the same downstream G-protein-dependent signaling pathway. We first tested for the G-protein subunit dependence of the rapid Dex facilitation of GABA release. Intracellular infusion through the patch pipette of an antiserum against the G\u03b1s protein subunit (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) failed to block the Dex (1 \u03bcm)-induced increase in mIPSC frequency (115.6 \u00b1 10.6% of control;  < 0.05;  = 7) (Fig. 3,). This suggested that the G\u03b1s subunit is not necessary for the glucocorticoid regulation of GABA release onto magnocellular neurons. We then tested whether the glucocorticoid facilitation of GABA release is coupled to the G-protein \u03b2\u03b3subunit. A G\u03b2 antiserum introduced through the recording pipette (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) blocked the Dex-induced increase in mIPSCs (100.6 \u00b1 2.4% of control;  = 0.63;  = 6) (Fig. 3,). Additionally, selective activation of the G\u03b2\u03b3 subunit by bath application of the G-protein \u03b2\u03b3-binding peptide mSIRK (0.5 \u03bcm) in the absence of glucocorticoid elicited an increase in mIPSC frequency (117.5 \u00b1 3.7%;  < 0.5;  = 8) similar to the Dex-induced increase in mIPSC frequency (Fig. 3). It also occluded the Dex-induced facilitation of GABA release, since subsequent Dex application (1 \u03bcm) in the continued presence of mSIRK failed to further increase mIPSC frequency (104.8 \u00b1 3.0% of mSIRK value,  = 0.15,  = 8) (Fig. 3). The specificity of the mSIRK effect was confirmed with application of the inactive isomer, mSIRK(L94), used as a negative control. mSIRK(L94) (0.5 \u03bcm) had no effect on the baseline mIPSC frequency by itself (101.6 \u00b1 3.7%;  = 5) and did not block the Dex-induced facilitation of mIPSC frequency (119.1 \u00b1 4.9% in the presence of mSIRK(L94);  < 0.05;  = 4) (Fig. 3). We further tested for a PKA dependence of the rapid glucocorticoid facilitation of inhibitory synaptic inputs. Intracellular application through the patch pipette of a PKA antagonist, cAMPS-Rp (50 \u03bcm), failed to block the Dex (1 \u03bcm)-induced increase in mIPSC frequency (113.1 \u00b1 3.2% of control;  < 0.05;  = 11) (Fig. 3). The Dex effect on mIPSC frequency appeared to be partially attenuated by the PKA inhibitor; however, the difference in the Dex effect with and without the internal PKA blocker was not significant. Therefore, the rapid glucocorticoid regulation of GABA release is not mediated by activation of a G\u03b1s-cAMP\u2013PKA signaling pathway.Distinct G-protein subunit dependence of glucocorticoid regulation of GABA synaptic inputs. , Normalized running average of mIPSC frequency (Freq). The increase in mIPSC frequency elicited by Dex (1 \u03bcm) using a control pipette solution ( = 6) was abolished when the intracellular pipette solution contained a G\u03b2 antibody ( = 6), but was unaffected by intracellular application of a G\u03b1s antibody (n = 7). , Summary histogram of the effect of Dex on mean mIPSC frequency in the presence of G-protein subunit antagonists, agonist and a PKA inhibitor. The Dex-induced increase in mIPSC frequency was not blocked by the G\u03b1s antibody, but was abolished by the G\u03b2 antibody. The selective G\u03b2-binding protein, mSIRK (0.5 \u03bcm), mimicked and occluded the Dex effect on mIPSC frequency, and the inactive mSIRK isomer, mSIRK(L94) (0.5 \u03bcm), had no effect on basal mIPSC frequency or on the Dex facilitation of mIPSC frequency. The PKA inhibitor cAMPS-Rp (50 \u03bcm) had no effect on the Dex-induced increase in mIPSC frequency. , Summary histogram of the effect of Dex on mean mEPSC frequency in the presence of G-protein subunit antibodies and a PKA inhibitor. The Dex-induced decrease in mEPSC frequency was not affected by intracellular application of the G\u03b2 antibody, but was abolished by the G\u03b1s antibody and PKA inhibitor cAMPS-Rp.In contrast, intracellular application of the G\u03b1s antiserum, as well as a PKA antagonist, cAMPS-Rp, blocked the Dex (1 \u03bcm)-induced decrease in mEPSC frequency (99.4 \u00b1 6.1% of control,  = 6; and 95.0 \u00b1 4.7% of control;  = 8, respectively) (Fig. 3), confirming our previous findings (Malcher-Lopes et al., 2006), whereas intracellular application of the G\u03b2 antiserum did not block the Dex effect on mEPSCs (74.1 \u00b1 6.0% of baseline;  < 0.05;  = 5) (Fig. 3). These results demonstrated, therefore, that the G\u03b1s-cAMP\u2013PKA signaling pathway is necessary for the glucocorticoid regulation of glutamate release on to magnocellular neurons. Together, our findings indicate that the rapid glucocorticoid suppression of glutamate release and facilitation of GABA release are dependent on different G-protein subunits and suggest a divergence in the G-protein signaling pathways responsible for the rapid, synapse-specific glucocorticoid regulation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to SON neurons.The glucocorticoid-induced suppression of glutamate release is blocked by leptin, which is mediated by phosphodiesterase 3B inhibition of cAMP activity (Malcher-Lopes et al., 2006). Here we tested the effects of leptin on the glucocorticoid-induced facilitation of inhibitory synaptic inputs. Bath application of leptin (10 nm) had no effect on basal mIPSCs (102.26 \u00b1 1.5% of baseline,  = 0.19;  = 6) and it failed to block the Dex-induced increase in mIPSC frequency (116.6 \u00b1 2.4% vs leptin, 118.6 \u00b1 5.4% vs baseline;  < 0.05;  = 6) (Fig. 4,). In contrast, leptin (10 nm) completely blocked the glucocorticoid-induced decrease in mEPSC frequency (99.6 \u00b1 8.0% of baseline;  = 0.18;  = 5) (Fig. 4), confirming our previous findings (Malcher-Lopes et al., 2006). Because leptin inhibition of the glucocorticoid-induced suppression of mEPSCs is mediated by inhibition of cAMP production, the lack of inhibitory effect of leptin on the glucocorticoid-induced facilitation of mIPSCs further indicates that the glucocorticoid-induced facilitation of GABA release works independently of the Gs/cAMP/PKA signaling mechanism.Distinct sensitivity to leptin of glucocorticoid modulation of glutamate release and GABA release. , Normalized running average (1 min bin width) of mPSC frequency (Freq). Leptin (10 nm) blocked the Dex (1 \u03bcm)-induced decrease in mEPSC frequency ( = 5), but failed to block the Dex-induced increase in mIPSC frequency (= 6). , Summary histogram of mean mIPSC frequency response to leptin and Dex. Leptin had no effect on either the basal mIPSC frequency or the Dex-induced increase in mIPSC frequency.Nitric oxide has been shown to act as a retrograde messenger in the regulation of GABA inputs to magnocellular neurons (Bains and Ferguson, 1997; Stern and Ludwig, 2001), and the PVN and SON express high levels of the NO synthetic enzyme, NOS (Nylen et al., 2001; Stern and Zhang, 2005). We tested, therefore, for a role of NO in the rapid glucocorticoid facilitation of GABA release. Bath application of l-NAME (50 \u03bcm), a subtype-nonselective NOS inhibitor, was without effect by itself on eIPSCs (102.7 \u00b1 4.3% of baseline,  = 5) but completely blocked the increase in the eIPSC amplitude by Dex (1 \u03bcm) (95.4 \u00b1 6.9% of baseline value; 92.9 \u00b1 5.5% of l-NAME value;  = 0.38;  = 5) (Fig. 5,). Similarly, l-NAME had no effect on basal mIPSC frequency, but it completely blocked the increase in mIPSC frequency induced by Dex (1 \u03bcm) (92.8 \u00b1 3 0.9% of baseline value; 102.1 \u00b1 3.5% of l-NAME value,  = 8) (Fig. 5,,). The NO production in response to Dex appeared to be of neuronal origin because the Dex effect on mIPSCs was also blocked by NPLA (1 \u03bcm), a selective neuronal NOS inhibitor (96.2 \u00b1 7.7% of baseline value; 97.6 \u00b1 1.7% of NPLA value,  = 4) (Fig. 5). The same application of l-NAME (50 \u03bcm), however, did not block the Dex-induced decrease in mEPSC frequency (72.9 \u00b1 4.9%;  < 0.5;  = 7) (data not shown) which corroborates our previous findings of the NO independence of the glucocorticoid suppression of glutamate release (Di et al., 2003).Glucocorticoid-induced facilitation of GABA release is mediated by nitric oxide. , The Dex (1 \u03bcm)-induced increase in amplitude (Amp) of eIPSCs was blocked by previous bath application of the NOS inhibitor l-NAME (50 \u03bcm). Traces are averages of 7\u20139 consecutive eIPSCs during the 3 min before l-NAME application (Control), during the last 3 min of a 10 min application of l-NAME, and during the last 3 min of a subsequent 10 min application of Dex and l-NAME. l-NAME had no effect by itself, but abolished the Dex-induced increase in eIPSC amplitude. , Summary histogram of mean evoked IPSC amplitudes in Dex, l-NAME, and Dex + l-NAME ( = 8). , Recording of mIPSCs 2 min before l-NAME application (Control) and following 10 min in l-NAME and 8 min in Dex (1 \u03bcm) + l-NAME. GABA currents are outward. , Normalized running average of mean mIPSC frequency (Freq) response to Dex and l-NAME. Dexamethasone (1 \u03bcm) had no effect on mIPSC frequency in the presence of l-NAME (50 \u03bcm). , Summary histogram of mean mIPSC frequency response to Dex in the presence of NOS antagonists. l-NAME and the nNOS-selective inhibitor NPLA (1 \u03bcm) were without effect on basal mIPSC frequency, but abolished the Dex-induced increase in mIPSC frequency. , Summary histogram of mean mIPSC frequency response to Dex in the absence and presence of NO precursor l-arginine (L-arg, 500 \u03bcm). l-Arginine and Dex had similar, nonadditive facilitatory effects on mIPSC frequency. The effects were not influenced by the order of application of the two compounds.In addition, the NO precursor l-arginine mimicked and occluded the facilitatory effect of Dex on GABA-mediated mIPSCs (Fig. 5). Thus, bath application of l-arginine (500 \u03bcm) caused an increase in mIPSC frequency (128.6 \u00b1 6.5% of baseline,  < 0.05,  = 7) that was similar to that elicited by Dex, without affecting mIPSC amplitude or decay time. Following 10 min of l-arginine application, the addition of Dex (1 \u03bcm) to the perfusion bath failed to elicit any additional increase in mIPSC frequency (96.9 \u00b1 2.7% of the l-arginine value,  = 7). Similarly, when the order of application of Dex and l-arginine was reversed, i.e., l-arginine was applied following a 10-min application of Dex, there was not an additive effect of the drugs on mIPSC frequency. These results together suggest that glucocorticoids and NO act on GABA release via a common mechanism.We showed previously that postsynaptic G-protein inactivation blocked the glucocorticoid-induced facilitation of GABA release (Di et al., 2005b). If NO synthesis is downstream from G-protein activation, stimulating NO production exogenously should mimic the glucocorticoid effect on GABA release despite blockade of G-protein activity. We tested this first by blocking G-protein activity with GDP-\u03b2-S (500 \u03bcm) applied intracellularly through the patch pipette, followed by bath application of the NO precursor l-arginine to stimulate NO synthesis. As shown above, blocking G-protein activity abolished the Dex-induced increase in mIPSC frequency, but the mIPSC frequency was subsequently increased following the addition of l-arginine (500 \u03bcm) to the perfusion bath (115.8 \u00b1 5.5% of the baseline,  < 0.05,  = 6) (Fig. 6). Similarly, intracellular infusion of an antibody to the G-protein \u03b2 subunit blocked the Dex-induced increase in mIPSC frequency, but subsequent bath application of the NO donor SNAP (100 \u03bcm) elicited an increase in mIPSC frequency (124.6 \u00b1 5.1%,  < 0.05,  = 6) (Fig. 6).Nitric oxide facilitation of GABA release is downstream of G-protein activation. Intracellular application of a G-protein blocker, GDP-\u03b2-S (500 \u03bcm), or the G\u03b2 antibody blocked the Dex-induced increase in mIPSC frequency. Subsequent addition of the NO precursor l-arginine (l-arg) (500 \u03bcm) or the NO donor SNAP (100 \u03bcm) reinstated the facilitation of GABA-mediated mIPSCs.We also measured the glucocorticoid-induced changes in NO levels in SON magnocellular neurons directly using fluorescence measurements in individual neurons loaded via the patch pipette with the NO indicator DAF-FM (21 \u03bcm) (Stern and Zhang, 2005; Sheng and Braun, 2007). Bath application of Dex (1 \u03bcm) caused a 12 \u00b1 4% increase in the intensity of DAF fluorescence in SON somata within 5\u201310 min (\u0394/0;  < 0.05;  = 8) (Fig. 7), suggesting a glucocorticoid-induced increase in NO production in magnocellular neurons. The NO donor SNAP (100 \u03bcm) was applied as a positive control for DAF sensitivity to NO. The Dex-induced increase in DAF fluorescence was abolished by bath application of l-NAME (50 \u03bcm) for 10 min before Dex application (\u0394/0 = 100 \u00b1 3% of baseline;  = 9) (Fig. 7).Glucocorticoid-induced increase in NO synthesis. , Top (left to right), Images of the relative fluorescence of the NO-sensitive dye DAF-FM (NODAF) in a magnocellular neuron recorded 3 min before Dex application (ACSF), 7 min after the onset of Dex application (1 \u03bcm), and 7 min following further exposure to an NO donor (SNAP, 100 \u03bcm) applied as a positive control. Bottom, Same experiment as in top, except that l-NAME was present throughout the experiment to prevent NO production via NOS. In the pseudocolor image scale (right), white corresponds to the highest fluorescence, blue the lowest. , Running average of DAF fluorescence normalized to control level measured during 3 min before Dex application. Dexamethasone (1 \u03bcm) elicited an increase in intracellular NO intensity within 3\u20135 min of bath application ( = 8). Ten minute preapplication of l-NAME (50 \u03bcm) abolished the Dex-induced increase in NO intensity ( = 9).Our previous findings demonstrated an opposing rapid glucocorticoid regulation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to magnocellular neurons of the SON and PVN via the activation of postsynaptic, membrane-associated glucocorticoid receptors and the release of one or more retrograde messengers (Di et al., 2005a,b; Di and Tasker, 2008). The rapid glucocorticoid action at excitatory synapses is dependent on a postsynaptic G\u03b1s-cAMP\u2013PKA signaling pathway (Malcher-Lopes et al., 2006) that leads to the synthesis and retrograde release of endocannabinoids and the presynaptic CB1 receptor-dependent suppression of glutamate release (Di et al., 2005b). Until now, the molecular mechanisms and the retrograde messenger responsible for the rapid glucocorticoid facilitation of GABA release, however, were not known. Here we show that the opposing glucocorticoid modulation of glutamate and GABA release is mediated by distinct G-protein signaling mechanisms, which stimulate the synthesis and release of different retrograde messengers, endocannabinoids and NO, at glutamate and GABA synapses. A model of the divergent signaling downstream from the putative membrane glucocorticoid receptors is presented in Figure 8. In this model, the steroid binds to a postsynaptic membrane G-protein-coupled receptor, or to a receptor associated with a G-protein-coupled receptor (Kelly and R\u00f8nnekleiv, 2008; Micevych and Mermelstein, 2008), which stimulates a G\u03b1s/cAMP/PKA-dependent synthesis of endocannabinoids and a G\u03b2\u03b3-dependent activation of nNOS and synthesis of NO. The endocannabinoids act as a retrograde messenger at excitatory synapses to suppress glutamate release and NO acts at inhibitory synapses to facilitate GABA release.Model of rapid glucocorticoid signaling in SON magnocellular neurons. According to this model, glucocorticoids (CORT) bind to a membrane-associated, G-protein-coupled receptor (mbGR) and activate divergent intracellular G-protein signaling pathways. Activation of G\u03b1s leads to cAMP/PKA-dependent endocannabinoid (eCB) synthesis; the activated G\u03b2\u03b3 dimer leads downstream to nNOS activation and NO synthesis. Endocannabinoids then act in a retrograde manner to suppress glutamate release from excitatory synaptic terminals via CB1 activation, and NO feeds back onto inhibitory synaptic terminals to facilitate GABA release onto SON magnocellular neurons. The combined suppression of synaptic excitation and facilitation of synaptic inhibition by glucocorticoids should cause a reduced excitability of the magnocellular neurons and a decrease in oxytocin (OXY) and vasopressin (AVP) release into the blood.Steroid hormones are capable of eliciting effects in target cells that do not rely on the transcriptional activity of classical intracellular steroid receptors, but rather are mediated by membrane-associated actions and signal transduction mechanisms. Several lines of evidence from our work suggest that the rapid glucocorticoid effects on hypothalamic neuroendocrine cells are mediated by a membrane-associated receptor and G-protein-dependent mechanism(s) (Di et al., 2003, 2005b; Malcher-Lopes et al., 2006). Specific G-protein subunits have been implicated in the nongenomic actions of other steroids. Blocking G\u03b1 and G\u03b2\u03b3 subunit activity, for example, prevents estrogen-induced nongenomic src/ERK and NO synthase activation in COS-7 and endothelial cells (Kumar et al., 2007), and the rapid action of androgen requires G\u03b2\u03b3 activation (Zagar et al., 2004). Here, we report the novel finding that the membrane glucocorticoid receptor activates both G-protein components to stimulate divergent signaling pathways to endocannabinoid and NO production. The G\u03b1s subunit was shown previously to mediate the glucocorticoid inhibition of glutamate release in both magnocellular and parvocellular neuroendocrine cells (Malcher-Lopes et al., 2006). We have confirmed those findings in magnocellular neurons in the current study, and we have provided new evidence showing that the G-protein G\u03b2\u03b3 subunit, but not the G\u03b1s subunit, is necessary for the glucocorticoid-induced increase in mIPSC frequency in magnocellular neurons, indicating a G\u03b2\u03b3-dependent mechanism of glucocorticoid-induced facilitation of GABA release.Leptin inhibits the glucocorticoid-induced endocannabinoid synthesis and endocannabinoid suppression of glutamate release from excitatory synapses by blocking postsynaptic cAMP production (Malcher-Lopes et al., 2006). The failure of leptin to block the glucocorticoid-induced facilitation of GABA release from inhibitory synapses described here suggests that the split in the membrane glucocorticoid receptor signaling pathway that leads to endocannabinoid and NO production occurs upstream from cAMP production. This further supports our thesis that glucocorticoids differentially regulate excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to magnocellular neurons through separate G\u03b1s and G\u03b2\u03b3 pathways.We reported previously that the glucocorticoid-induced facilitation of GABA release in magnocellular neurons was blocked by the CB1 antagonist AM251, but was not mimicked by any of the cannabinoid agonists tested, anandamide, 2-AG, and WIN 55,212-2 (Di et al., 2005b; Tasker et al., 2006). In contrast, here we found that the glucocorticoid facilitation of GABA release was not blocked by two other CB1 receptor antagonists, SR141716 (rimonobant) and 2050. The glucocorticoid-induced suppression of glutamate release, however, is blocked by both AM251 and SR141716 (Di et al., 2005b). These findings together indicate that the rapid glucocorticoid modulation of GABA release is not mediated by a retrograde endocannabinoid messenger, and that AM251 exerts a CB1-independent effect on glucocorticoid-induced GABA release.Our current findings suggest that NO is the retrograde messenger involved in the rapid glucocorticoid facilitation of GABA release in magnocellular neuroendocrine cells. Nitric oxide is an important activity-dependent modulator of the magnocellular neuroendocrine response to physiological stimuli such as stress, dehydration and lactation (Srisawat et al., 2000; Stern, 2004; Ryu et al., 2008). Neurons of the PVN and SON show robust NOS expression (Stern and Zhang, 2005; Yuan et al., 2006), and the application of NO precursors or NO donors preferentially facilitates synaptic GABA release (Stern and Ludwig, 2001; Li et al., 2002, 2003), consistent with a close functional and anatomical coupling of NO and GABA in the SON (Stern and Zhang, 2005). Although there is recent evidence for NO facilitation of glutamate release in the SON  (Gillard et al., 2007), NO regulation of synaptic activity in the hypothalamus is primarily implicated in the facilitation of GABA release to modulate neuronal excitability (Zhang and Patel, 1998; Krukoff, 1999; Yang et al., 2007). Our observation of a NO dependence selectively of the glucocorticoid modulation of GABA release in the SON is consistent with these findings.The glucocorticoid-induced facilitation of GABA release was blocked by both the nonspecific NOS inhibitor l-NAME and the nNOS-selective antagonist NPLA, suggesting that NO synthesis is mediated by nNOS, and that the source of the NO, therefore, is neuronal. In our experiments, both NMDA and AMPA glutamate receptors were pharmacologically blocked, indicating that the glucocorticoid-induced NO production was mediated by an NMDA receptor-independent mechanism (Amir, 1994; Bains and Ferguson, 1997; Kiss and Vizi, 2001). Determining the NO signaling pathway downstream from G\u03b2\u03b3 requires further study.Nitric oxide has been implicated in the mechanisms of other rapid, nongenomic steroid actions. Estrogen exerts rapid vasoprotective actions via enhanced NO release that is mediated by activation of both PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways (Wyckoff et al., 2001; Lu et al., 2004; Mantione, 2008). Aldosterone has also been reported to induce NO-dependent rapid nongenomic effects on the renal vasculature in humans (Chun and Pratt, 2006). Furthermore, glucocorticoids have been reported to activate NOS via a nongenomic PI3K/Akt pathway, leading to NO-dependent vasorelaxation  (Hafezi-Moghadam et al., 2002). Similarly, a nongenomic, NO-dependent neuro-protective effect of glucocorticoids was reported in a cerebral ischemia model (Limbourg et al., 2002).An interesting observation stemming from our findings is the strict spatial segregation of the glucocorticoid-induced endocannabinoid and NO actions at glutamate and GABA synapses, respectively. Several mechanisms may contribute to this synapse specificity. First, the presynaptic effector mechanisms responsive to cannabinoid and NO signaling may be selectively expressed at either glutamate or GABA terminals, respectively. Second, the postsynaptic synthesis and release of each of the messengers may be highly localized to either glutamate or GABA synapses. Third, extracellular diffusion barriers (e.g., astrocytes) may limit the actions of the messengers to one synapse type or the other. Although NO modulation of glutamate release has not been described in magnocellular neurons (although see Gillard et al., 2007), functional presynaptic CB1 receptors are expressed at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the SON (Di et al., 2005b), such that GABA terminals also possess cannabinoid signaling capability. Whereas it might be expected, and indeed it has been reported (Wilson and Nicoll, 2002), that endocannabinoids have a relatively limited spatial range of diffusion, the spatial restriction of NO diffusion is less likely, since as a gas its spread would be expected to be more promiscuous, reaching volumes with a radius of up to 100 \u03bcm (Philippides et al., 2000). It is likely, therefore, that the mechanism responsible for the synapse-specific actions of endocannabinoids and NO involves a combination of localized release and extracellular constraints on diffusion, such as barriers formed by astrocytic coverage of synapses (Piet et al., 2004).The glucocorticoid regulation of neurohypophysial neurons is characterized primarily by an inhibition of PVN and SON magnocellular neuron activation and of oxytocin and vasopressin secretion. Glucocorticoids rapidly modulate the overall responsiveness of vasopressin and oxytocin neurons, serving potentially to coordinate the activity of the HPA and hypothalamic neurohypophysial systems (Lauand et al., 2007; Ruginsk et al., 2007). Stress and stress levels of glucocorticoids inhibit oxytocin release and milk ejection in lactating animals, delay parturition in late pregnancy (Papanek et al., 1997; Douglas and Russell, 2001; Russell et al., 2001), and inhibit vasopressin release during hemorrhage (Darlington et al., 1989, 1990).The rapid glucocorticoid regulation of glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic inputs to magnocellular neurons shown in this study are likely to have robust functional consequences for the release of vasopressin and oxytocin. Decreasing glutamate release and facilitating GABA release would be expected to tip the excitation-inhibition balance significantly toward inhibition in these cells. This overall inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids is likely to underlie the negative feedback effect of stress-induced glucocorticoids on neurohypophysial hormone release. These rapid inhibitory feedback actions of glucocorticoids during the stress response may play an integrative role in the regulation of neuroendocrine function as well as a neuroprotective role in the hypothalamus, since both endocannabinoids and NO are known to have anti-inflammatory actions in the brain (Malcher-Lopes et al., 2008).This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants MH066958 and MH069879.

To define the parameters that specify the postsynaptic expression of KARs, we examined the contribution of KARs to EPSCs on hippocampal interneurons in area CA1. Interneurons in stratum radiatum/lacunosum-moleculare express KARs both with and without the GluR5 subunit, but KAR-mediated EPSCs are generated mainly, if not entirely, by GluR5-containing KARs. Extrasynaptic glutamate spillover profoundly recruits AMPA receptors (AMPARs) with little effect on KARs, indicating that KARs are targeted at the synapse more precisely than AMPARs. However, spontaneous EPSCs with a conventional AMPAR component did not have a resolvable contribution of KARs, suggesting that the KARs that contribute to the evoked EPSCs are at a distinct set of synapses. GluR5-containing KARs on interneurons in stratum oriens do not contribute substantially to the EPSC. We conclude that KARs are localized to synapses by cell type-, synapse-, and subunit-selective mechanisms.Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS. There are three main subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptors: NMDA receptors, AMPA receptors (AMPARs), and kainate receptors (KARs) (Bettler and Mulle, 1995; Lerma et al., 2001; Huettner, 2003). AMPARs and KARs are homologous and have similar biophysical properties in expression systems but play distinct roles in the CNS (Lerma, 2006; Pinheiro and Mulle, 2006). KAR-mediated EPSCs are found at several central synapses (Castillo et al., 1997; Vignes and Collingridge, 1997; Cossart et al., 1998; Frerking et al., 1998; DeVries and Schwartz, 1999; Kidd and Isaac, 1999, 2001; Li et al., 1999; Bureau et al., 2000; Eder et al., 2003), and extrasynaptic somatodendritic KARs regulate cellular excitability (Melyan et al., 2002; Fisahn et al., 2005).Within the hippocampus, KARs play a variety of roles and are expressed both on excitatory principal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. Interneurons limit circuit excitability, coordinate network oscillations, and mediate release of several neuropeptides (Freund and Buzsaki, 1996; McBain and Fisahn, 2001; Baraban and Tallent, 2004). It has been widely proposed that interneuronal KARs may be a key site at which interneurons can be regulated to affect circuit excitability (Frerking and Nicoll, 2000; Khalilov et al., 2002; Christensen et al., 2004), but the roles of KARs on interneurons remain unclear.KARs are composed of five subunits (GluR5\u2013GluR7, KA1, and KA2) (Huettner, 2003). GluR5 is thought to be of particular importance in interneurons, because these cells express most of the GluR5 in the hippocampus (Bureau et al., 1999; Paternain et al., 2000). KAR-mediated currents can be elicited by GluR5-selective agonists (Maingret et al., 2005) and are abolished in mice that lack both the GluR5 and GluR6 subunits (Mulle et al., 2000). These findings suggest that GluR5-containing KARs contribute to interneuronal excitation and activation. However, other studies report that KAR currents are abolished in mice lacking only GluR6 (Fisahn et al., 2004) and are resistant to GluR5 antagonists (Christensen et al., 2004); this suggests that GluR5-containing KARs are excluded from the somatodendritic compartment. One potential complication of using genetic knock-outs to address this issue is that compensation by the remaining receptor subunits may result in mislocalization of these receptors (Christensen et al., 2004).To better define the role of KARs in the interneuronal EPSC, we used whole-cell patch-clamp recording to directly examine and compare the properties of KARs in two distinct subtypes of interneurons during activation by exogenous agonists and by synaptically released glutamate. We found that most somatodendritic KARs on interneurons in stratum radiatum/lacunosum-moleculare (SR/SLM) lack the GluR5 subunit, but postsynaptic KARs on these cells contain GluR5. The localization of GluR5-containing KARs at the synapse is highly precise and is distinct from the distribution of AMPARs. These KARs contribute substantially to synaptic charge transfer in SR/SLM interneurons but not stratum oriens (SO) interneurons. These results demonstrate that the localization of KARs at the synapse is regulated by receptor subunit composition, varies across different excitatory synapses onto SR/SLM interneurons, and differs between interneurons in SR/SLM and those in SO.Recordings were performed as described by Frerking et al. (1998). Briefly, hippocampal slices (300\u2013400 \u03bcm thick) were prepared from 2- to 3-week-old Sprague Dawley rats. Rats were rapidly decapitated under deep anesthesia with the inhalant anesthetic halothane, the brain was removed, and hippocampi were bilaterally dissected out. Hippocampal slices were cut using a Vibratome and incubated for >1 h in artificial CSF solution containing the following (in mm): 119 NaCl, 26.2 NaHCO3, 11 glucose, 2.5 KCl, 4 CaCl2, 4 MgSO4, and 1.0 NaH2PO4 (bubbled with 95% O2\u20135% CO2). The slices were kept in a perfusion chamber until the experiment, at which time they were transferred to a recording chamber.All experiments were done in the presence of 100 \u03bcm d-APV and 100 \u03bcm picrotoxin to block NMDA and GABAA receptors, respectively, and 100 \u03bcm NBQX was applied at the end of experiments to ensure that the measured EPSCs were mediated by AMPAR/KARs. Rapid application of agonists was done with PV830 Pneumatic PicoPump attached to a patch pipette placed near the cell; agonist delivery was driven by brief (10\u201320 ms) application of pressure (5\u201325 psi) to the pipette. Both pressure and bath application of agonists were performed in the presence of 0.5 \u03bcm TTX. For pressure-evoked application of agonists, a high concentration of agonist in the pipette was used (100 \u03bcm), as is generally the case for this type of experiment; the concentration of agonist seen by receptors on the cell is unknown but presumably far smaller as a result of dilution as the agonist diffuses through the tissue. Patch pipettes were filled with internal solution containing the following (in mm): 100 CsOH, 100 gluconic acid, 2.5 CsCl, 10 tetraethylammonium Cl, 5 QX-314 Cl [2(triethylamino)--(2,6-dimethylphenyl) acetamine Cl], 8 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 10 CsBAPTA, 4 Mg ATP, 0.3 Na3GTP, and 0.1 spermine. A high concentration of CsBAPTA was used in the internal solution to block slow Ca+2-gated conductances during the EPSC that might contaminate the measured tail currents.Area CA3 was microdissected away from area CA1 to prevent recurrent excitation. Schaffer collateral/commissural fibers were stimulated with a bipolar stimulating electrode placed in stratum radiatum, at a rate of 0.1 Hz between stimuli. Stimuli were delivered either singly or in brief trains of two to five stimuli at 20\u2013100 Hz. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were obtained from CA1 interneurons identified using infrared differential interference microscopy and held at \u221270 mV. Displaced pyramidal cells outside of stratum pyramidale (SP) were excluded from the analysis by avoiding cells that had a prominent apical dendrite running parallel to that of pyramidal cells. The characteristics of the interneurons we studied here are described extensively in supplemental Note 1 (available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material); briefly, we selected interneurons in SR/SLM that are clustered around the border between these two layers, whereas we selected interneurons in SO by choosing cells that were clearly located outside SP, with dendrites running parallel to the alveus (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).Electrophysiological recordings were obtained using Axopatch amplifiers and IgorPro Software, filtered at 2 kHz, and digitized at 10 kHz. Series resistances (typically between 10 and 25 M\u03a9) and input resistances (typically between 200 and 500 M\u03a9) were monitored online to ensure stability of recordings. Recordings were excluded from analysis if these parameters changed by >25% over the course of the experiment, unless this change was an expected consequence of the experimental protocol (i.e., a change in the input resistance associated with agonist application). Cells were also excluded if the observed result could be explained by an associated change in either parameter, even if the magnitude of the change was <25%.Data analysis was performed using IgorPro and SigmaPlot software; spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) were detected and analyzed using MiniAnalysis and Neuromatica. Our threshold for resolution of sEPSCs was routinely \u223c3\u20135 pA. Spontaneous events were aligned by rise time for averaging. Data were compared using the Student's  test, and paired  tests were used as appropriate. Significance was assessed at  < 0.05. All data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM.To define the somatodendritic population of KARs, we examined agonist-induced currents on SR/SLM interneurons. These interneurons have been shown in previous studies to express the pore-forming subunits GluR5 and GluR6 and the accessory subunit KA2 (Bureau et al., 1999; Lein et al., 2007) (supplemental Note 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Changes in the holding current were measured in response to bath application of kainate receptor agonists and antagonists, with an extracellular solution containing d-APV (100 \u03bcm), picrotoxin (100 \u03bcm), and GYKI 53655 [1-(4-aminophenyl)-3-methylcarbamyl-4-methyl7,8-methylenedioxy-3,4-dihydro-5-2,3-benzodiazepine] (100 \u03bcm) to block NMDA, GABAA, and AMPA receptors, respectively. To activate interneuronal KARs without respect to their subunit composition, we used the nonselective agonists kainate and domoate (for a summary of relevant pharmacology, see supplemental Note 2 and Table 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Low doses of domoate (50 nm) and kainate (3 \u03bcm) elicited average inward currents of 103 \u00b1 26 pA ( = 5) and 81 \u00b1 14 pA ( = 7) (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), respectively, that were subsequently blocked with NBQX (100 \u03bcm), a nonselective AMPAR/KAR antagonist.To assess the contribution of GluR5-containing KARs to agonist-evoked currents, we used the GluR5-selective antago-nist UBP 302 [()-1-(2-amino-2-carboxyethyl)-3-(2-carboxybenzyl)pyrimidine-2,4-dione] (10 \u03bcm). We first established that this antagonist was selective for KARs, because it did not block currents induced by bath-applied AMPA (100 nm plus 100 \u03bcm cyclothiazide in the absence of GYKI 53655) (2 \u00b1 2% block;  = 6) (Fig. 1,); we then examined whether UBP 302 blocked the currents evoked by kainate and domoate. UBP 302 had a modest effect on the domoate (15 \u00b1 9% block;  = 5) and kainate (21 \u00b1 9%;  = 7) currents (Fig. 1,), which indicates that these currents are mediated mainly by kainate receptors that lack GluR5. However, this does not exclude the possibility that KARs containing GluR5 are present in small numbers that are overwhelmed by a larger population of KARs lacking GluR5. To address this possibility, we bath applied the KAR agonist ()-2-\u03b1-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-tert-butylisoxazol-4-yl) propanoic acid (ATPA) (3 \u03bcm), which selectively activates GluR5-containing KARs at concentrations <10 \u03bcm (Paternain et al., 2000; Alt et al., 2004). ATPA elicited KAR currents (126 \u00b1 42 pA;  = 5), and these currents were almost completely blocked by UBP 302 (91 \u00b1 4% block;  = 5) (Fig. 1,). Thus, KARs containing GluR5 are indeed present on these cells and can be recruited by exogenous agonists. Thus, although GluR5-containing KARs were present and could be selectively engaged by a low concentration of ATPA, the majority of the KAR current was mediated by GluR5-lacking KARs when this current was elicited by the nonselective KAR agonists domoate and kainate.GluR5 is present in a subset of interneuronal kainate receptors. Effects of UBP 302 on agonist-induced currents were examined. UBP 302 had no effect on AMPA-induced currents shown over the entire application of AMPA () and at higher temporal resolution around the antagonist application (). , The nonselective KAR agonist domoate induced an inward current that was primarily insensitive to the GluR5-selective antagonist UBP 302. , ATPA, an agonist that selectively activates GluR5-containing KARs, evoked an inward current that was completely blocked by UBP 302. , A summary of the effect of UBP 302 on various agonist-induced currents. , Effects of UBP 302 on agonist-induced currents were also examined using rapid application methods. A brief puff (10\u201320 ms) of 100 \u03bcm kainate was applied to the cell and induced an inward current in the absence (black) and presence (gray) of UBP 302. CTZ, Cyclothiazide; ctl, control.To ensure that our conclusions were not confounded by steady-state activation of the receptors during the prolonged bath application of agonists, we repeated a subset of these experiments with rapid pressure ejection of kainate (Fig. 1). Rapid application (10\u201320 ms) of kainate (100 \u03bcm) elicited average inward currents of 29 \u00b1 7 pA ( = 5) that was only modestly blocked (31 \u00b1 6%;  = 5) by UBP 302. There was no significant difference in effectiveness of UBP 302 whether the agonist was delivered by bath application or pressure ejection ( > 0.4), so the data have been pooled from the two conditions (Fig. 1).Agonist application activates all of the KARs on the cell, precluding differentiation between postsynaptic and extrasynaptic receptors. To determine whether the KARs activated through agonist application were representative of the receptor population activated during synaptic transmission, we examined the effects of UBP 302 on stimulus-evoked EPSCs (eEPSCs) recorded from SR/SLM interneurons. Dual KAR/AMPAR-mediated EPSCs recorded from these cells are biphasic, with a large peak amplitude that decays rapidly and a small tail component that decays slowly. We found previously that addition of GYKI 53655 blocked almost all of the fast peak of the biphasic EPSC; in contrast, the slow tail of the EPSC was primarily, although not entirely, resistant to GYKI 53655 (Frerking et al., 1998).To examine the effects of UBP 302 on these components of the EPSC, synaptic responses were elicited by extracellular stimulation in stratum radiatum, using either single stimuli or a brief train of five stimuli for better resolution of the small tail current. On average, UBP 302 blocked the peak of the eEPSC by 9 \u00b1 2% and the slowly decaying tail of the eEPSC by 40 \u00b1 5% ( = 9) (Fig. 2,).GluR5-containing KARs are selectively activated in response to synaptic glutamate. , EPSCs elicited by a brief train of five stimuli were recorded from an SR/SLM interneuron, as shown at a low () and a high () gain. Traces were averaged from 5 to 25 sweeps in control conditions and again after bath application of 10 \u03bcm UBP 302. Here and throughout the figures, averaged traces recorded in NBQX have been subtracted from the data, and the stimulus artifact has been removed for clarity. , The peak of the EPSC is primarily unaffected by UBP 302, and the late, slow component of the tail is significantly, but incompletely, blocked by UBP 302. , The averaged KAR-mediated EPSC recorded in the presence of GYKI 53655 is almost completely blocked by UBP 302. , A summary of the amount of inhibition elicited by UBP 302 in the absence and presence of GYKI 53655 is shown. , The UBP 302-insensitive component of the eEPSCs (recorded in the presence of 10 \u03bcm UBP 302) was partially blocked by 2 \u03bcm GYKI 53655. The kinetics of the partially blocked eEPSC were no different from that of the unblocked eEPSC, as shown by scaling the trace in 2 \u03bcm GYKI 53655 (gray trace) to the same peak amplitude as the EPSC in the absence of GYKI 53655. , The same finding was observed in six cells, as displayed by a comparison of the cumulative charge transfer of the averaged EPSCs in both conditions. Cumulative charge transfers under each condition were normalized to their own maximum value, to facilitate a direct comparison of the kinetics of the EPSCs in each condition.The observation that the tail current was only partially blocked by UBP 302 suggests that only a fraction of the receptors generating the tail current contain GluR5. We thought it likely that the UBP 302-insensitive tail current was mediated by KARs that lack GluR5, because these KARs generate the majority of the currents seen during domoate and kainate application. However, because AMPARs were not blocked in this experiment, it remained possible that this remaining tail current was mediated by AMPARs. To differentiate between these possibilities, we recorded pharmacologically isolated KAR eEPSCs in the presence of 50 \u03bcm GYKI 53655. Surprisingly, UBP 302 blocked the KAR eEPSC in the presence of GYKI 53655 almost entirely (peak, 79 \u00b1 7% block; tail, 79 \u00b1 10% block;  = 8) (Fig. 2,); in fact, the fractional inhibition of UBP 302 on the KAR EPSC was not significantly different from the fractional inhibition of UBP 302 on currents elicited by the GluR5-selective agonist ATPA.These results suggested that KARs at the synapse are composed mainly, if not entirely, of GluR5-containing KARs, with the concomitant conclusion that the UBP 302-insensitive tail current of the EPSC is in fact mediated by AMPARs. However, one potential concern with this interpretation is that a recent report has suggested that GluR7-containing KARs may be substantially blocked by GYKI 53655 at concentrations >10 \u03bcm (Perrais et al., 2008). In contrast to GluR5 and GluR6, GluR7 expression is minimal in SR/SLM interneurons (supplemental Note 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), so we think it unlikely that GluR7-containing KARs are a significant factor in these cells; however, to ensure that the UBP 302-insensitive component of the EPSC is not mediated by GluR7-containing KARs, we examined the effects of 2 \u03bcm GYKI 53655 on the EPSC in the presence of UBP 302. This dose of GYKI 53655 is similar to the published IC50 of GYKI 53655 for AMPARs (1\u20132 \u03bcm) but is well below the IC50 for GluR7-containing KARs (30\u201360 \u03bcm) (Perrais et al., 2008). We found that 2 \u03bcm GYKI 53655 blocked the UBP 302-insensitive EPSC by 67 \u00b1 5% ( = 6) (Fig. 2), consistent with the inhibition expected if AMPARs mediate the overwhelming majority of the UBP 302-insensitive EPSC. Importantly, this low dose of GYKI 53655 blocked the peak and tail of the UBP 302-insensitive EPSC equally and had no effect on the time course of the eEPSC (Fig. 2,) ( > 0.3); this rules out the idea that the slow component of the UBP 302-insensitive EPSC is selectively mediated by GluR7-containing KARs.Thus, GluR5-containing KARs are preferentially targeted to the synapse. In contrast, GluR5-lacking KARs are primarily if not entirely excluded from the synapse, although they are the major contributor to KAR currents elicited by domoate and kainate.The small amplitude and slow kinetics of the KAR EPSC seen here has also been reported at several other synapses (Castillo et al., 1997; Vignes and Collingridge, 1997; Bureau et al., 2000; Kidd and Isaac, 2001). However, KARs at other synapses (DeVries, 2000; Cossart et al., 2002; DeVries et al., 2006) and those that are heterologously expressed (Paternain et al., 1998; Swanson and Heinemann, 1998; Lerma et al., 2001) have large peak amplitudes and rapidly desensitize, similar to the kinetics of AMPARs. The mechanisms underlying these striking differences in the kinetics of the EPSC remain essentially unknown; one possibility with some experimental support is that the kinetics of KARs may be slowed by the expression of the KA1 and KA2 subunits (Contractor et al., 2003; Barberis et al., 2008). Our finding that SR/SLM interneurons express not only a slow KAR EPSC but also a similarly slow AMPAR-mediated tail current caused us to carefully consider the possibility that both of these slow EPSCs are attributable to the simultaneous detection of glutamate spillover by both receptor subtypes at extrasynaptic locations.As an initial test of this idea, we examined the effects of brief stimulus trains on the tail current relative to the peak current, being careful to examine both the KAR- and AMPAR-mediated tail currents. If glutamate accesses extrasynaptic KARs and AMPARs through spillover out of the cleft, then the successive release events during a brief stimulus train might be expected to more effectively overwhelm uptake and lead to extrasynaptic accumulation of spillover, thereby disproportionately enhancing the slow tail currents.We compared responses to single stimuli with those elicited by a high-frequency train of five stimuli (Fig. 3). Because of the slow decay kinetics of these EPSCs, each successive stimulus during the train occurs before the current returns to baseline, and there is summation of the tail current. To determine whether this summation can be explained by linear summation of the EPSC in response to individual stimuli, we scaled and summated the eEPSC in response to single stimuli and compared this with the eEPSC in response to the stimulus train. The tail current in response to high-frequency stimulation was not disproportionately larger than that expected based on the summation of EPSCs in response to individual stimuli (Fig. 3). UBP 302 blocked an identical proportion of the charge transfer of the single pulse and train of five eEPSCs (Fig. 3), indicating that the KAR to AMPAR ratio remains unchanged in response to high-frequency stimulation. Thus, KAR tail currents during the EPSC are not selectively affected by high-frequency activity.The contribution of KARs to the EPSC is unchanged in response to high-frequency stimulation. High-frequency stimulation were compared with single pulse stimulation in the same cell ( low gain,  high gain) to assess whether the tail component of the eEPSC was enhanced during bursts of activity. eEPSCs in response to single stimuli were scaled and summated (gray trace) and compared with eEPSCs recorded during high-frequency stimulation (black trace). , Increasing stimulus frequency did not affect the relative contribution of KARs and AMPARs to charge transfer during the evoked EPSC. , Application of UBP 302 had no effect on the ratio of the fifth EPSC relative to the first EPSC during the train of EPSCs, indicating that UBP 302 did not affect short-term plasticity during the train.One possible complication in interpreting the amount of block produced by UBP 302 on single versus high-frequency eEPSCs is that the high-frequency train might activate presynaptic KARs in addition to postsynaptic KARs, as has been shown to occur in a subset of somatostatin-containing interneurons (Sun and Dobrunz, 2006). A block of presynaptic KARs could conceivably affect r during the train, which would alter short-term plasticity and complicate a comparison of the train-evoked EPSCs with those evoked by single stimuli. However, application of UBP 302 had no effect on short-term plasticity during the train, as assessed by measuring the ratio of peak amplitudes during the fifth and first stimuli (the p5/p1 ratio) (Fig. 3). This argues against an effect of UBP 302 on r.The UBP 302-insensitive tail also showed no significant increase in response to a train of stimuli. This suggests that neither the AMPAR tail currents nor the KAR tail currents during these brief trains are attributable to spillover, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the increased glutamate release during a brief train is not sufficient to elicit a resolvable change in spillover relative to a single stimulus. We also note that this result is difficult to reconcile with preferential saturation of KARs. The frequency-dependent depression at these synapses implies a high initial release probability, so the train is likely to evoke repetitive activation of the same synapses. If KARs but not AMPARs were saturated by glutamate, then AMPARs would be able to respond during repetitive activation but KARs would not. This would lead to an increase in the AMPAR contribution to the charge transfer during trains relative to single stimuli, which we did not observe.To more robustly manipulate glutamate spillover, we evoked EPSCs in the presence of dl-threo-\u03b2-benzyloxyaspartic acid (TBOA) (100 \u03bcm), an inhibitor of glutamate transporters (Fig. 4). The dual KAR/AMPAR-mediated eEPSC showed a dramatic and selective potentiation of the slow tail component in the presence of the TBOA (Fig. 4,), indicating that the inhibition of glutamate uptake could lead to substantial recruitment of AMPARs/KARs attributable to glutamate spillover. The increase in synaptic charge transfer during TBOA application was profound (910 \u00b1 146% charge transfer in TBOA relative to baseline;  = 11) (Fig. 4,). However, UBP 302 had a very modest effect on this potentiated tail current, arguing that GluR5-containing KARs were not substantially recruited by TBOA (8 \u00b1 6% block;  = 10) (Fig. 4,). The tail current elicited by TBOA could be attributable to extrasynaptic AMPARs or GluR5-lacking KARs that are not accessed by synaptic glutamate release when uptake is intact. To block AMPARs and examine the effects of spillover on KARs in isolation, we repeated these experiments in 50 \u03bcm GYKI 53655. The KAR eEPSC recorded under these conditions showed no significant enhancement in response to TBOA application (104 \u00b1 21% charge transfer in TBOA relative to control;  = 6) (Fig. 4,). Individual cells sometimes showed a modest effect of TBOA on the KAR eEPSC as shown in Figure 4, but this was variable across cells, not apparent in the population average, and negligible compared with the effect on the combined AMPAR/KAR EPSC. The tail current elicited by TBOA was completely blocked by UBP 302 and GYKI 53655 in combination (100 \u00b1 2% inhibition;  = 4) (Fig. 4), and the effects of TBOA were not associated with a significant change in the holding current ( = 10) (Fig. 4). We note that the complete blockade of the TBOA-induced currents by UBP 302 and GYKI 53655 makes it highly unlikely that a substantial fraction of this current is mediated by GluR7-containing receptors, which would be expected to have residual currents of \u223c20\u201350% at the dose of GYKI 53655 that we have used (50 \u03bcm); given that the TBOA-induced increase in charge transfer was often on the order of 1000% of control values, we would have been able to easily detect residual currents of this magnitude.Interneuronal KARs are not accessed by glutamate spillover. , The averaged EPSCs evoked before and after TBOA application are shown for a representative experiment. The tail current is dramatically potentiated by TBOA. , UBP 302 had a minimal effect on the TBOA-potentiated tail current, indicating that it is not mediated by GluR5-containing KARs. , TBOA had no significant effect on EPSCs evoked in the presence of GYKI 53655, indicating that the large TBOA-induced tail current seen in  is not mediated by KARs but by AMPARs. , UBP 302 has little effect on the charge transfer in the presence of TBOA, but UBP 302 and GYKI 53655 together block the charge transfer entirely. , The TBOA-induced potentiation of charge transfer seen in the absence of GYKI 53655 (filled symbols) is not seen in the presence of GYKI 53655 (open symbols). , TBOA had no significant effect on the holding current.Thus, TBOA can lead to a large and slow tail current, indicating that it is effective in eliciting glutamate spillover. However, the tail current recruited by this spillover is overwhelmingly mediated by AMPARs and not KARs, indicating that KARs are localized at the synapse more precisely than AMPARs.Our results thus far show that KARs are not recruited by glutamate spillover, even when spillover is substantially enhanced by blocking glutamate uptake. Thus, KARs appear to be located directly at the synapse. However, it remains possible that KARs are not colocalized at the same synapses that express AMPARs, because evoked EPSCs are generated by the synchronous activation of multiple presynaptic fibers. We therefore examined sEPSCs, which are not subject to this limitation.Colocalization of AMPARs and KARs should lead to biphasic sEPSCs, with an AMPAR-mediated peak, and a tail mediated by KARs and AMPARs. We would not necessarily expect to resolve the tail currents of individual sEPSCs, which would be very small in the presence of substantial baseline noise, but the signal-to-noise resolution can be improved by several-fold by averaging together many sEPSCs (>50) and examining the kinetics of the averaged sEPSC (supplemental Fig. 3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). A slow tail current was not discernable in the average sEPSCs, nor was there a significant residual transfer of charge 100 ms after the peak of the sEPSC. There was also no effect of UBP 302 on the sEPSC during the region in which a tail might be expected 100 ms after the peak ( = 10) (Fig. 5,).Synapses that generate fast AMPAR sEPSCs cannot account for the tail current of the evoked EPSC. Spontaneous EPSCs were recorded in the presence of picrotoxin and d-APV. , Averaged sEPSCs were recorded in control conditions (black) and in the presence of UBP 302 (gray). , The cumulative charge transfer of sEPSCs reaches its maximum in <100 ms, in contrast to that of the evoked EPSC. , UBP 302 had no effect on the frequency (freq) or amplitude (ampl) of sEPSCs recorded in control conditions. The sEPSCs were completely blocked by GYKI 53655, indicating that these events were mediated solely by AMPARs. , GYKI 53655 blocked all resolvable sEPSCs, as shown in a representative cell.To ensure that the absence of a tail current in the sEPSC was not being artificially depressed by 4 mm Ca/4 mm Mg external solution used in these experiments, we repeated these experiments in another set of cells with 2.5 mm Ca/1.3 mm Mg ( = 9). We observed identical results in both cases (supplemental Fig. 3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) and therefore pooled the data together.To assess our limits of resolution for the kinetics of the averaged sEPSCs, we examined the cumulative charge transfer over the course of the averaged sEPSC and compared it with the cumulative charge transfer during the eEPSC. The charge transfer during averaged sEPSCs was obviously complete in a much shorter period of time than eEPSCs ( < 0.001) (Fig. 5). The residual charge transfer 100 ms after the eEPSC onset was 24 \u00b1 4% ( = 10), whereas the residual charge transfer 100 ms after the sEPSC onset was negligible (\u22121 \u00b1 2%;  = 19). Of course, not all of the tail of the eEPSC is mediated by KARs. Given the 40 \u00b1 5% inhibition of the tail by UBP 302, we calculate that the residual KAR-mediated charge transfer 100 ms after the onset of the eEPSC is 10 \u00b1 2%; this is still clearly much larger that the entire charge transfer during a comparable time window after the sEPSC ( < 0.002). Thus, the KARs activated during the eEPSC cannot be explained by KAR colocalization with AMPARs at the synapses that generate conventional AMPAR sEPSCs.This led us to the prediction that there should be a separate population of synapses with a commensurately smaller contribution of AMPARs but a commensurately larger contribution of KARs. However, we would not necessarily expect to be able to resolve sEPSCs from these synapses, because the peak amplitude of the KAR eEPSC relative to the AMPAR eEPSCs (Fig. 2) would predict an average KAR sEPSC with <1 pA peak amplitude and very slow kinetics. This is well below our limit of resolution for individual sEPSCs and contrasts markedly with previous reports (Cossart et al., 2002; Goldin et al., 2007), which have found that KARs on interneurons in SO generate sEPSCs and even miniature EPSCs that are large, rapid, and readily detectable (see below); the spontaneous KAR EPSCs observed in these previous reports are similar to AMPAR-mediated currents but persist when AMPARs are blocked. To see whether we could similarly resolve large and fast KAR sEPSCs in SR/SLM interneurons, we first examined whether UBP 302 had any effect on the frequency or peak amplitude of sEPSCs. We were unable to detect an effect of UBP 302 on either parameter (amplitude, 6 \u00b1 9% inhibition; frequency, 8 \u00b1 11% inhibition;  = 10) (Fig. 5). We next examined the effects of GYKI 53655 on sEPSCs recorded from SR/SLM interneurons to see whether we could resolve any events that were resistant to GYKI 53655. Addition of 50 \u03bcm GYKI 53655 blocked all detectable events ( = 7) (Fig. 5,), consistent with our initial expectations based on observations of the eEPSC. These results indicate that the KARs activated during the evoked EPSC in these cells cannot be accounted for by a colocalization of AMPARs and KARs at the synapses that generate rapid sEPSCs.Although we did not observe a KAR-mediated tail in sEPSCs, one final possibility regarding the colocalization of these receptors with AMPARs is that the KARs are located perisynaptically in an annulus surrounding a synapse containing AMPARs. In this scenario, the KARs would be located at a distance at which they can be engaged by multivesicular release but not univesicular release. This might lead to a selective activation of KARs during stimulus-evoked transmission but not spontaneous transmission because multivesicular release requires the high r that occurs during the calcium transient elicited by a presynaptic spike but not during spontaneous vesicle fusion (Tong and Jahr, 1994; Christie and Jahr, 2006).If this scenario is correct, then multivesicular release should occur at high r and lead to a higher concentration of glutamate in the synaptic cleft. Thus, we can test whether multivesicular release occurs at excitatory synapses onto interneurons by examining whether the concentration of glutamate in the synaptic cleft is sensitive to r, using low-affinity competitive antagonists to assess glutamate concentration. Briefly, low-affinity competitive antagonists are sensitive to the concentration of synaptically released glutamate because they unbind from the receptor so rapidly that glutamate has a chance to compete with the antagonist for the ligand binding site. If multivesicular release occurs, we would expect that a low-affinity competitive antagonist should be less effective during high r, at which multivesicular release is dominant, and more effective at low r, at which univesicular release is dominant.To test this hypothesis, we examined the inhibition of the eEPSC caused by the low-affinity AMPAR/KAR antagonist \u03b3-d-glutamylglycine (\u03b3-DGG) (500 \u03bcm). In control conditions, \u03b3-DGG blocked the peak amplitude of the eEPSC by 40 \u00b1 2% ( = 10) (Fig. 6). We then bath applied the GABABR agonist baclofen (5 \u03bcm) to engage presynaptic inhibition and lower r and reapplied \u03b3-DGG. Baclofen reduced the size of the EPSC by 57 \u00b1 6% ( = 10) (Fig. 6,); in the presence of baclofen, \u03b3-DGG was not significantly more effective than in control conditions (41 \u00b1 3%;  = 10) (Fig. 6). Thus, multivesicular release does not occur at these synapses, precluding a model in which perisynaptic KARs are selectively recruited during evoked transmission but not spontaneous transmission.Multivesicular release does not contribute to the interneuronal EPSC. AMPAR EPSCs were evoked in the presence of APV, picrotoxin, and UBP 302. , Left, Averaged traces of a representative cell in control conditions (black; ctl) and in the presence of \u03b3-DGG (gray). (Right) Averaged traces of EPSCs evoked in the presence of 5 \u03bcm baclofen (black; bac) and in the presence of both baclofen and \u03b3-DGG (gray). , The same traces in  scaled so that the control trace and the trace in baclofen, both before the addition of \u03b3-DGG, are amplitude matched. , EPSC amplitudes (percentage control) were recorded from a representative cell. \u03b3-DGG caused a reversible partial block of the AMPAR EPSCs that was similar in control conditions and in baclofen. , A summary is shown of the block elicited by \u03b3-DGG in the presence (black) and absence (white) of baclofen, averaged across all experiments.Our observations of SR/SLM interneurons contrast markedly with previous studies of SO interneurons, which found that KARs produce clearly resolvable spontaneous synaptic currents in these cells. In these previous studies, even miniature KARs in SO interneurons were found to be large (averaging \u223c10 pA), fast (decay time constant \u223c10 ms), and frequent (\u223c2 Hz); these KAR-mediated events were a sizeable fraction of the total population of spontaneous synaptic currents observed (>30% under a wide range of conditions and across all identified subsets of SO interneurons) (Cossart et al., 2002; Goldin et al., 2007). Interneurons are heterogeneous, so one possible resolution to these conflicting results is that the properties of KARs in SR/SLM interneurons and SO interneurons differ so that the KAR EPSC in SR/SLM interneurons is small and slow, whereas the KAR EPSC in SO interneurons is large and fast.To test this idea, we recorded eEPSCs from SO interneurons. The slowly decaying tail current was much less robust in SO interneurons than in SR/SLM interneurons (Fig. 7,); in most SO interneurons, there was no detectable tail current at all. The difference in the average magnitude of the tail current between interneurons in SO and those in SR/SLM was clearly evident in averaged charge transfer traces in response to brief stimulus trains (SO,  = 11; SR/SLM,  = 9) (Fig. 7). SO interneurons can be divided into subpopulations with distinct physiological characteristics (Freund and Buzsaki, 1996; Pouille and Scanziani, 2004); cells with physiological features typical of a common subtype, the O-LM interneuron, were readily identified and accounted for more than half of the SO interneurons recorded (7 of 11) (supplemental Fig. 4, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). None of these putative O-LM interneurons expressed a detectable tail current.GluR5 KARs are excluded from the synapse at stratum oriens interneurons. , Averaged eEPSCs recorded from an SR/SLM interneuron have a distinct, slowly decaying tail current. , Averaged eEPSCs recorded in SO have notably smaller tail currents, when detected at all. , The slow tail current contributes significantly to the charge transfer of the EPSCs recorded from SR/SLM cells but not for EPSCs recorded from SO interneurons. , In SR/SLM cells, the late, slow component of the tail is significantly blocked by UBP 302. Here and in , the total charge transfer during the EPSCs are normalized with respect to the total charge transfer in control conditions (ctl); thus, the fact that the charge transfer in the presence of UBP 302 reaches an asymptote at significantly <100% in SR/SLM interneurons indicates that the total charge transfer is significantly reduced by UBP 302 in these cells. , UBP 302 has no significant effect on the cumulative charge transfer of eEPSCs in SO interneurons. UBP 302 substantially blocked currents induced by nonselective KAR agonists, as shown by the effect of UBP 302 on currents elicited by 50 nm domoate () or by the GluR5-selective agonist ATPA (). , All resolvable sEPSCs were blocked by 50 \u03bcm GYKI 53655 in SO interneurons.We next examined whether GluR5-containing KARs contribute substantially to the evoked EPSCs on SO interneurons. We were unable to detect any significant effect of UBP 302 on the cumulative charge transfer for eEPSCs on SO interneurons, again in marked contrast to what we found on SR/SLM interneurons (SR/SLM,  = 9; SO,  = 11) (Fig. 7,). Subdivision of SO interneurons into putative O-LM and non-O-LM also did not reveal a significant effect of UBP 302 in either set of cells (1 \u00b1 1% in non-OLM cells,  = 4; 6 \u00b1 10% in O-LM cells,  = 7;  > 0.3). These results indicate that GluR5 is absent from synapses onto SO interneurons.One possible explanation for this finding is that SO interneurons might not express GluR5. To assess the contribution of GluR5 to KARs on SO interneurons, we examined the effect of UBP 302 on currents elicited by domoate (120 \u00b1 34 pA;  = 3) and kainate (105 \u00b1 52 pA;  = 4) (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). On average, UBP 302 was substantially more effective on currents elicited by these nonselective agonists in SO interneurons than in SR/SLM interneurons (SO, 57 \u00b1 14% inhibition; SR/SLM, 18 \u00b1 6% inhibition) (Fig. 7) (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Rapid application of ATPA also elicited a current that was almost entirely blocked by UBP 302 (ATPA, 19 \u00b1 3 pA; block by UBP 302, 80 \u00b1 7%;  = 4) (Fig. 7). Thus, GluR5-containing KARs are present on SO interneurons.These results suggest that GluR5 is selectively localized to synapses onto SR/SLM interneurons but not SO interneurons, confirming that the properties of KARs differ across different classes of interneuron. We reasoned that the large and rapid spontaneous KAR EPSCs found in previous studies of SO interneurons were likely attributable to KARs that lack the GluR5 subunit, which would not be sensitive to UBP 302. To address this possibility, we examined whether a population of sEPSCs could be isolated in the presence of 50 \u03bcm GYKI 53655. Surprisingly, however, we were unable to detect any GYKI 53655-resistant sEPSCs under these conditions ( = 13) (Fig. 7).To address the possibility that GluR7 might confer a higher GYKI 53655 sensitivity to KARs on SO interneurons, we repeated these experiments using 10 \u03bcm GYKI 53655. This dose should strongly block AMPARs (\u223c90% inhibition) with only modest effects on GluR7-containing KARs (\u223c25% inhibition) (Perrais et al., 2008). Even under these conditions, GYKI 53655 led to an almost complete inhibition of sEPSCs (97 \u00b1 3% reduction in frequency;  = 3) (supplemental Fig. 5, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). The rare remaining events in 10 \u03bcm GYKI 53655 may be attributable to GluR7-containing KARs. However, we caution that we cannot exclude the alternative that they could be AMPAR-mediated EPSCs that were still within our limits of resolution during the strong, but incomplete, blockade by this concentration of GYKI 53655. In either case, we conclude that the contribution of postsynaptic KARs to the EPSC is minimal in SO interneurons and clearly distinct from the role of KARs in generating the slow EPSC in SR/SLM interneurons.Thus, our findings do support the idea that the synaptic expression of KARs is different for SR/SLM interneurons and SO interneurons; however, this does not completely explain the discrepancy between the properties of synaptic KARs in SR/SLM interneurons that we have reported here and the properties of synaptic KARs in SO interneurons that have been presented in previous reports (Cossart et al., 2002; Goldin et al., 2007), because we did not observe the sEPSCs described in those reports.The reason for the difference between our own findings and those of Cossart and colleagues is unclear. Even miniature KAR EPSCs reported by Cossart and colleagues were frequent (\u223c2 Hz on average) and large (\u223c10 pA on average), so we should have been able to easily detect these events if they were present in our recordings. Similarly, we would not expect the size or frequency of miniature EPSCs to drop below our limit of resolution attributable to any of the minor experimental variables that often vary between laboratories. It may still be the case that we inadvertently recorded from a distinct subset of SO interneurons from those examined by Cossart and colleagues; however, we think this is unlikely, because a significant fraction of the cells in their studies were O-LM interneurons. These interneurons express unusual physiological characteristics, most notably a pronounced short-term facilitation (Losonczy et al., 2002; Wierenga and Wadman, 2003; Pouille and Scanziani, 2004), and this was readily observed in many of our recordings of SO interneurons.In this study, we identified several parameters that specify the functions of KARs on hippocampal interneurons in area CA1. These interneurons express two distinct KAR subtypes: those that contain the GluR5 subunit and those that lack it. Although GluR5-lacking KARs generate most of the current in response to the exogenous agonists kainate and domoate, GluR5-containing KARs are the major KAR subtype activated during synaptic transmission onto SR/SLM interneurons. The KAR EPSC on these cells is small and slow, and to our surprise we found a component of the AMPAR EPSC that was similarly small and slow. However, several lines of evidence suggest that the slow kinetics of the KAR EPSC do not reflect glutamate spillover onto extrasynaptic KARs. Moreover, KARs do not contribute a resolvable tail component to sEPSCs identified by the presence of a conventional rapid AMPAR component, indicating that the synapses that generate these large, rapid sEPSCs cannot account for the KAR currents in the evoked EPSC. In contrast to these findings in SR/SLM interneurons, we were unable to demonstrate any substantial contribution of postsynaptic KARs to the EPSC in SO interneurons.Our results demonstrate the existence of two distinct subtypes of KARs on hippocampal SR/SLM interneurons that differ in their subunit composition. GluR5-containing KARs are targeted to synapses and generate a small, slow EPSC. GluR5-lacking KARs are excluded from the area surrounding the synapse, and their function remains unclear. One possibility is that they regulate excitability at the soma via metabotropic effects on the afterhyperpolarization (Melyan et al., 2002; Fisahn et al., 2005).UBP 302 was far more effective at inhibiting synaptic currents than it was on currents evoked by kainate or domoate, so the current evoked by nonselective agonists is dominated by GluR5-lacking KARs that are distinct from the GluR5-containing KARs at the synapse. This dominance of GluR5-lacking KARs in response to exogenous agonists compared with synaptic glutamate is unlikely to be attributable to different subunit preferences for the different agonists, because none of them have a substantial preference for GluR6 over GluR5 (supplemental Table 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). It is also unlikely that the difference stems from activation of distinct subunits within heteromeric receptors, because UBP 302 can fully antagonize currents elicited in GluR5-containing heteromers (Alt et al., 2004; More et al., 2004).To our knowledge, these results are the first demonstration that native KARs are differentially incorporated into the postsynaptic site or excluded from it based on their subunit composition. Subunit-dependent synaptic targeting of AMPARs is thought to underlie long-term plasticity (L\u00fcscher et al., 2000; Bredt and Nicoll, 2003) and occurs in interneurons (T\u00f3th and McBain, 1998). It seems likely that similar mechanisms are involved in targeting of KARs. Consistent with this, the C-terminal sequences of both GluR6 and splice variants of GluR5 contain PDZ (postsynaptic density-95/Discs large/zona occludens-1)-binding motifs and can interact with scaffolding proteins (Garcia et al., 1998; Hirbec et al., 2003). However, it remains unclear whether glutamate receptor trafficking is similar in interneurons and pyramidal cells, because these cell types also express different AMPAR subunits (Geiger et al., 1995).Both AMPARs and KARs can support a slow tail current that lasts for hundreds of milliseconds after the peak of the EPSC. This led us to carefully evaluate the possibility that the slow EPSC is generated by the extrasynaptic spillover of glutamate, sensed by both receptor subtypes. Attempts to elicit spillover by brief trains did not facilitate either the KAR EPSC or the AMPAR EPSC; blocking glutamate uptake did not resolvably enhance the KAR EPSC but recruited a substantial spillover-mediated AMPAR EPSC. The finding that glutamate transporters so profoundly limit the activation of AMPARs but not KARs during synaptic glutamate release is surprising, because it suggests that KARs are located opposite the glutamate release site more precisely than AMPARs. Thus, the slow kinetics of the KAR EPSC likely reflect intrinsic properties of native receptors that are determined by KAR subunit composition (Contractor et al., 2000), interactions with accessory proteins (Garcia et al., 1998), or cytosolic messengers (Swanson and Heinemann, 1998).The results with TBOA demonstrate that a slow spillover-mediated AMPAR EPSC can be recruited by blocking glutamate uptake. This effect is useful in the current context as a control, indicating that TBOA can elicit spillover although it has no effect on the KAR EPSC. More generally, the effect of TBOA on AMPARs at this synapse is massive compared with other effects of spillover onto AMPARs (Arnth-Jensen et al., 2002; Chen and Diamond, 2002; Diamond, 2002; DiGregorio et al., 2002; Takayasu et al., 2004; DeVries et al., 2006). The recruitment of a slow AMPAR EPSC by TBOA lends some credence to the idea that the slow AMPAR component during the evoked EPSC might be mediated by spillover even during single stimuli under normal conditions.However, our data are not immediately compatible with this idea: if single stimuli were sufficient to overwhelm uptake and elicit spillover lasting for hundreds of milliseconds, it would also surely be the case that this spillover could be facilitated during brief high-frequency trains, which should more effectively overwhelm uptake than single stimuli. We did not observe a facilitation of the tail current during trains, nor was there an activity-dependent change in the relative contribution of AMPARs to the EPSC. Thus, the mechanisms underlying the slow AMPAR tail current remain unclear. One possibility is that the slow AMPAR component of the EPSC when uptake is intact reflects activation of a distinct subset of synaptic AMPARs with unusual properties, possibly conferred by accessory proteins (Cho et al., 2007; Milstein et al., 2007).The absence of a resolvable tail current in averaged sEPSCs from SR/SLM interneurons indicates that at least some of the synapses that mediate the fast component of the evoked EPSC have AMPARs without a substantial complement of KARs. For the same reason, the AMPARs that contribute to the tail current of the evoked EPSC are also unlikely to be present at these synapses. Because the KAR component of the evoked EPSC is not a result of spillover, we infer that a separate population of synapses must have KARs without a substantial complement of AMPARs. We were unable to directly resolve sEPSCs with these properties; however, given the small size of the KAR EPSC even when evoked by extracellular stimulation, we would expect that these events are too small for us to detect. An alternate explanation is that the KAR-enriched synapses might have an exceptionally low spontaneous release rate, so that they simply do not generate sEPSCs. In either case, our results suggest that different synapses onto SR/SLM interneurons activate different receptors with distinct kinetics and may mediate distinct functions; inputs generating the fast AMPAR EPSC would transmit afferent spike timing, whereas inputs generating the slow AMPAR and/or KAR EPSCs would transmit afferent spike rates (K\u00f6nig et al., 1996; Frerking and Ohliger-Frerking, 2002). One possible explanation for these kinetically distinct synapses is that they may correlate with distinct afferent populations, because SR/SLM interneurons receive inputs from the entorhinal cortex in addition to CA3 pyramidal cells (Somogyi and Klausberger, 2005).In contrast to our results in SR/SLM interneurons, most SO interneurons had little or no tail current in the evoked EPSC, and we were unable to detect any effect of UBP 302 on the eEPSCs in these cells. Thus, the slow KAR EPSC mediated by GluR5-containing KARs in SR/SLM interneurons is differentially expressed across distinct subsets of interneurons. GluR5-containing KARs on SO interneurons were activated by exogenous agonists, consistent with previous reports (Yang et al., 2006, 2007), so the absence of synaptic GluR5-containing KARs in SO interneurons is not attributable to a lack of GluR5.Is there a functional significance to the selective expression of the slow KAR EPSC on SR/SLM interneurons but not SO interneurons? There are a number of differences between SR/SLM interneurons and SO interneurons (supplemental Note 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material); a notable distinction is that SO interneurons are the major source of feedback inhibition, whereas SR/SLM interneurons are major contributors to feedforward inhibition (Freund and Buzsaki, 1996; McBain, 2000; McBain and Fisahn, 2001). Research on feedforward inhibition has focused on temporal precision and synchrony (Pouille and Scanziani, 2001; Assisi et al., 2007; Bartos et al., 2007; Mann and Paulsen, 2007), which is likely mediated by fast AMPAR inputs on SR/SLM interneurons. Synapses that express KARs would more likely be an activity-dependent mechanism for slow, reliable changes in the background membrane potential.In summary, the synaptic expression of KARs in hippocampal interneurons is finely tuned, through subunit-dependent localization of KARs to a subset of synapses on SR/SLM interneurons but not SO interneurons. The precision of KAR targeting and the unusual kinetics of the KAR EPSC suggest that these receptors play a specific and distinct role in signal processing during the transfer of information through the hippocampal circuit.We acknowledge Craig Jahr and Rowland Taylor for insightful discussion, Sean Wolfson and Rachel Dresbeck for assistance with manuscript preparation, and Dara Partovi for technical assistance.

We characterized secretion of guidance cues, neuropeptides, neurotrophins, and proteases from single secretory vesicles using pHluorin-tagged cargo in cortical neurons. Stimulation triggered transient and persistent fusion events. Transient events represented full release followed by cargo diffusion or incomplete release followed by vesicle retrieval, as previously observed in neuroendocrine cells. Unexpectedly, we also observed that certain cargo, such as Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A), was delivered at the cell surface as stable deposits. Stable deposits and transient events were observed for single cargo and both were SNARE (soluble -ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) and calcium dependent. The ratio between stable and transient events did not depend on cargo size, subcellular localization (synaptic vs extrasynaptic secretion), or the presence of the extracellular matrix. Instead, the ratio is cargo specific and depends on an interaction with the vesicle matrix through a basic domain in the cargo protein. Inhibition of this interaction through deletion of the basic domain in Sema3A abolished stable deposits and rendered all events transient. Strikingly, cargo favoring transient release was stably deposited after corelease with cargo favoring stable deposit. These data argue against cargo diffusion after exocytosis as a general principle. Instead, the vesicle matrix retains secreted signals, probably for focal signaling at the cell surface.Communication between neurons is mediated by the regulated secretion of molecules from two main classes of secretory vesicles: small synaptic vesicles and larger secretory (dense-core) granules. Synaptic vesicles release neurotransmitters at the presynaptic terminal, whereas the less precisely defined class of secretory granules mediates secretion of a diverse array of proteins with important roles in neuronal development and plasticity, such as neuropeptides, neurotrophic factors, guidance cues, and proteases (Parmer et al., 1997; Haubensak et al., 1998; McAllister et al., 1999; Pang and Lu, 2004; Sahay et al., 2005; Bouzioukh et al., 2006; de Wit et al., 2006; Morita et al., 2006). Despite its importance for neuronal function, secretory granule exocytosis in neurons remains poorly understood.It has been suggested that secretory granule exocytosis in neurons is similar to peptide/hormone secretion in neuroendocrine cells, which has been intensely studied. The release characteristics of secretory granules in these cells are complex: in addition to classical full fusion, secretory granules sometimes release only a fraction of their content. This appears to be attributable to two main factors. First, fusion pores can open only transiently and the fusion machinery restricts cargo diffusion out of the vesicle (Lindau and Almers, 1995; Artalejo et al., 1998; Al\u00e9s et al., 1999). Second, electrostatic interactions between the luminal matrix consisting of charged (glyco)proteins and basic residues in condensed cargo restrict cargo diffusion (Kelly, 1985; Arvan and Castle, 1998). The strength of these interactions is modulated by intravesicular pH and cellular cAMP levels (Aspinwall et al., 1997; Angleson et al., 1999). As a result of these interactions and transient fusion pore opening, secretory vesicles can reseal directly after exocytosis (Holroyd et al., 2002; Taraska et al., 2003), retaining part of their cargo. This may facilitate cargo reuse and regulate the extent of cargo release (Taraska et al., 2003; An and Zenisek, 2004; Perrais et al., 2004; Scalettar, 2006). Hence, secretory granules in neuroendocrine cells undergo exocytosis through at least two distinct mechanisms: full fusion and incomplete exocytosis followed by reinternalization of the partially emptied vesicle. Whether these mechanisms also exist in neurons is unclear. Neuronal exocytosis may differ from neuroendocrine cells (Silverman et al., 2005).Here we investigated neuronal secretory granule release using live imaging of vesicles transporting cargo tagged with superecliptic pHluorin, a pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein (Miesenb\u00f6ck et al., 1998; Sankaranarayanan et al., 2000), to detect individual fusion events. In addition to the release events previously observed in neuroendocrine cells, we found that certain cargo types are delivered as stable deposits at the cell surface, especially the guidance cue Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A), the protease tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). These stable deposits, like transient fusion events, were Ca2+ and soluble -ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) dependent and occurred at both synaptic and extrasynaptic locations and at locations with and without extracellular matrix. Coexpression of two cargo types in single vesicles shifted the ratio between transient and persistent events. Moreover, inhibiting the interaction between the vesicle matrix and the basic residues of Sema3A abolished the stable deposits and rendered all fusion events transient.Cerebral cortices from C57BL/6 mouse E18 embryos were dissected free of meninges in HBSS (Invitrogen) supplemented with 7 mm HEPES and digested with 0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen) in HBSS/HEPES for 20 min at 37\u00b0C. Tissue was washed three times in HBSS/HEPES and triturated with a fire-polished glass pipette. Dissociated neurons were plated at a density of 25,000 cells/well on top of a layer of rat glial cells grown at a density of 37,500 cells/well on 18 mm glass coverslips (Menzel Glaser) in 12-well plates. Cells were grown in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), 18 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm Glutamax (Invitrogen), 25 \u03bcm \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Half the medium was replaced once a week. Calcium phosphate transfections were performed as described previously (K\u00f6hrmann et al., 1999). Cells were routinely transfected at 6\u20138 d  (DIV) and imaged between 14 and 22 DIV. For tetanus neurotoxin experiments, cells were transfected at 11 DIV with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and imaged at DIV 14. The transfection procedure used mainly transfects neurons but occasionally results in a transduced glial cell. However, these are easily distinguished from neurons by their distinct morphology and were not included in this study. In addition, the neuronal identity of the cells imaged in this study was verified by retrospective immunocytochemistry for the dendritic marker MAP2 in a number of the experiments.SemapHluorin was generated by replacing EGFP in Sema3A-EGFP (De Wit et al., 2005) with the superecliptic pHluorin (SpH) coding sequence. tPA-SpH and neuropeptide Y (NPY)-SpH were generated by replacing EGFP or Venus with SpH. BDNF-SpH was generated by PCR amplifying prepro-BDNF cDNA from an adult rat cDNA library and subcloning it into the EGFP-N1 vector (Clontech) in which EGFP had been replaced with SpH. Sema\u0394BD was generated by amplifying SemapHluorin minus the basic domain (amino acids 728\u2013770 in rat Sema3A) using the following primers: cgggatccgcaaacggaaagaacaatg and gccgcggccgctcagacactccacacttgttcacagaactcatc. The resulting fragment was ligated into the SemapHluorin expression plasmid. Tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT)-IRES-mRFP was generated by subcloning the TeNT light chain and poliovirus IRES sequence into an mRFP-N1 backbone (Clontech). SpH and synaptopHluorin were kindly provided by Dr. G. Miesenb\u00f6ck (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT); synaptophysin-mCherry by Dr. A. Jeromin (Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, WA); tetanus toxin light chain by Dr. T. Galli (INSERM, Paris, France); NPY-Venus by Dr. A. Miyawaki (Brain Science Institute, RIKEN, Saitama, Japan); and tPA-GFP by Dr. B. Scalettar (Lewis and Clark College, Portland, OR). Red variants of Sema3A, tPA, and BDNF were obtained by replacing SpH with mRFP.Coverslips were placed in a chamber containing Tyrode's solution (2 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm KCl, 119 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 30 mm glucose, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and imaged on an Axiovert II microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a heated stage (\u223c32\u00b0C), a Coolsnap HQ camera (Photometrics), and a Polychrome IV illumination unit (TILL Photonics). Cells were continuously perfused with Tyrode's. Images were acquired in MetaMorph 6.2 software (Universal Imaging) using a 40\u00d7 objective. Cells were stimulated with a triple-barreled pipette positioned near the imaged cell, which allowed for quick changes in the composition of stimulating solutions. Depolarizing Tyrode's solution contained 60 mm KCl (2 mm CaCl2, 60 mm KCl, 61.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 30 mm glucose, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Intracellular pH was neutralized with normal Tyrode's solution containing 50 mm NH4Cl, which replaced NaCl on an equimolar basis in the solution. Low-pH (pH 5.5) Tyrode's used for acid wash experiments was identical to normal Tyrode's except that HEPES was replaced with the membrane-impermeant buffer 2-(-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. Tyrode's containing 0 mm Ca2+ and 5 mm EGTA was used as a control (0 mm CaCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 60 mm KCl, 61.5 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 30 mm glucose, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Field stimulation was applied through parallel platinum electrodes immersed into the perfusion chamber, delivering 30 mA, 1 ms pulses, using a Master8 stimulator (AMPI) and a Stimulus Isolator A385 (World Precision Instruments). The effectiveness of depolarizing solution and field stimulation was verified by the ability to induce synaptic secretion from synaptopHluorin-expressing neurons.For FM4-64 labeling experiments, terminals were loaded with a train of 600 pulses at 20 Hz in the presence of 10 \u03bcm FM4-64 (Invitrogen). After 1 min, cells were washed by perfusion with dye-free Tyrode's for 10 min. Cells were destained by the application of 60 mm KCl Tyrode's for 1 min. Images were taken of the FM4-64 signal before and after depolarization and subtracted to exclude background labeling. For tetanus neurotoxin experiments, cells were cotransfected with synaptopHluorin or SemapHluorin, TeNT-IRES-mRFP, and pECFP-C1 (Clontech) to visualize distant neurites, because mRFP expression from the second cistron only labeled the cell body. Imaged neurites were traced back to the soma to verify expression of all three plasmids in imaged cells. For the quantification of secretion in the presence of bafilomycin, synaptopHluorin- or SemapHluorin-expressing cells were first stimulated in the absence of bafilomycin. After a 10 min wash with Tyrode's, 1 \u03bcm bafilomycin A1 (Sigma) was applied to the cells for 30 s and washed out again by perfusion with Tyrode's. Imaging was started within 1 min after application of bafilomycin. Analysis of SemapHluorin release in the absence or presence of bafilomycin was done blind to the treatment condition. DNQX was from Sigma, and APV was from Tocris.For analysis of interaction with the extracellular matrix, medium was supplemented with heparin (0.1 mg/ml, Sigma) 24 h before image acquisition or with chondroitinase ABC (chonABC, 0.1 U/ml for 2 h, Sigma) or hyaluronidase (500 \u03bcU/ml for 18 h, Calbiochem). Treatment with these substances resulted in a loss of Sema3A deposits (or \u201chalo\u201d) on the supporting glial cells. The efficiency of chondroitinase treatment was further evaluated using antibody 2B6, which detects chondroitin sulfate stubs generated after chonABC treatment (De Wit et al., 2005). Hyaluronidase efficiency was examined by incubating live neurons with biotinylated hyaluronic acid-binding protein (HABP, 5 \u03bcg/ml, USBiological) for 18 h at 37\u00b0C, after which cells were fixed and incubated with Alexa564 streptavidin. HABP labeling resulted in a punctate expression pattern, which was absent in hyaluronidase-treated cultures.Stacks from time-lapse recordings acquired with 1 s intervals were used to analyze the dynamics of SemapHluorin release. SemapHluorin release events were detected by eye while playing movie stacks. A 4 \u00d7 4 pixel region of interest was centered on the event, and average intensity of fluorescence therein was measured. Fluorescent traces were graphed as the change in fluorescence (\u0394) normalized to the initial fluorescence (\n0), obtained by averaging the last five frames before onset of stimulus, as a function of time. Onset of exocytosis was defined as the first frame in which the average fluorescence increased above a threshold of \u0394/\n0 = 0.1. Transient events were defined as an abrupt increase in fluorescence, followed by a rapid decrease back to baseline levels (typically <30 s in 90% of events); persistent events were characterized by an abrupt increase in fluorescence that remained elevated above baseline (typically >30 s in 80% of events). Events were defined as transient if an event lost >50% of the peak \u0394/\n0 fluorescence at 50% of the time that the fluorescence was above baseline. Duration of events was defined as the time that the average fluorescence remained above the threshold of \u0394/\n0 = 0.1. For experiments in which cells were sequentially stimulated with K+ and NH4Cl or low-pH Tyrode's, the local background was determined by measuring the average fluorescence in a 10 \u00d7 10 pixel region next to the release event and subtracting this value from the event. Background subtraction was mainly required after acid wash experiments, because of the presence of secreted SemapHluorin adhering to the substrate around imaged neurites, which strongly reacted to perfusion with low-pH Tyrode's. Movement of fluorescent spots was analyzed by manually tracking the center of spots using the \u201ctrack points\u201d function in MetaMorph. Spots were tracked for 30 s after their appearance, and the total distance moved during this period was calculated.For representation in figures, original MetaMorph images were duplicated at 200% zoom to reduce pixelation, using the interpolation function in MetaMorph to compute the values for each new pixel based on the original values surrounding it. Data analysis was always performed on the original images.Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, for 20 min at room temperature (RT). Cells were washed in PBS and blocked in PBS-FBS [PBS containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen) and 0.2% Triton X-100] for 1 h at RT. Incubations with primary antibodies were done overnight at 4\u00b0C in PBS-FBS. Primary antibodies used were MAP2 mAb (Millipore) and synapsin I/II pAb (E028). Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Invitrogen. After several washes, coverslips were mounted in ProLong antifade reagent (Invitrogen) and examined on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser-scanning microscope. Specificity of staining was confirmed by omission of the primary antibody. For live-cell labeling of imaged neurons, cells were removed from the stage, briefly washed with PBS, and incubated with GFP pAb (Abcam) in PBS for 5 min at RT. Cells were quickly washed in PBS and fixed. After three washes in PBS, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. Cells were washed, permeabilized in PBS-FBS, and subsequently processed for MAP2 immunocytochemistry.To visualize secretory granule exocytosis in neurons, we generated a series of constructs expressing secretory granule cargo tagged with SpH (Miesenb\u00f6ck et al., 1998; Sankaranarayanan et al., 2000): NPY-SpH, the neurotrophin BDNF-SpH, the protease tPA-SpH, and the guidance cue Sema3A-SpH. These cargo types were expressed in dissociated cortical neurons and analyzed using live-cell imaging.We first analyzed whether different release events (complete vs incomplete release), as previously characterized in neuroendocrine cells (Holroyd et al., 2002; Taraska et al., 2003; Perrais et al., 2004), also occur in neurons using Sema3A-SpH (SemapHluorin) as a marker. Expression of SemapHluorin in dissociated neurons resulted in a characteristic punctate distribution (Fig. 1\n), in accordance with the vesicular localization of endogenous Sema3A and Sema3A-EGFP (de Wit et al., 2006). Application of NH4Cl strongly increased the fluorescence of these puncta (Miesenb\u00f6ck et al., 1998) and revealed many new fluorescent puncta (Fig. 1\n), indicating that SemapHluorin is correctly sorted to acidic secretory vesicles and can be used to assess secretory vesicle exocytosis in neurons at single vesicle resolution. Correct sorting was also confirmed for SpH-fusions of NPY, tPA, and BDNF (data not shown). All four cargo proteins are normally expressed in cortical neurons (Higuchi et al., 1988; Hofer et al., 1990; Giger et al., 1996; Basham and Seeds, 2001).Characterization of SemapHluorin in cortical neurons. \n\n, Punctate SemapHluorin distribution in fixed and permeabilized cell (DIV 16). \n\n, MAP2-positive dendrites of neuron in \n\n. \n\n, Merged image shows SemapHluorin puncta in dendrites (arrowheads) and axon (arrow). \n\n, Live image of SemapHluorin-expressing cortical neuron (DIV 22). \n\n, NH4Cl application results in the appearance of many bright fluorescent puncta in neurites (arrowheads). The brightness of the soma also increases after application of NH4Cl, presumably because of an increase in SemapHluorin fluorescence in the Golgi apparatus, which is slightly acidic (pH \u223c6.2) (Ashby et al., 2004). \n\n, SemapHluorin fluorescence returns to baseline levels after washout of NH4Cl. \n\n, Blow-up of boxed region in \n\n.

Stable puncta were selected for quantification. Black bar indicates duration of NH4Cl application. Scale bars: \n\n (for \n\n), \n\n (for \n\n), 20 \u03bcm; \n\n, 5 \u03bcm.Depolarization of SemapHluorin-expressing neurons with 60 mm K+ resulted in the abrupt appearance of many bright fluorescent puncta (Fig. 2\n; supplemental Movie 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Some of these puncta dimmed rapidly (Fig. 2, vesicle 2), whereas others dimmed slowly (vesicle 3). Strikingly, a number of puncta remained bright (vesicles 4 and 5) without appreciable decline in fluorescence. All these events occurred with varying delays after onset of stimulus and at multiple locations along the axon. Interestingly, after vesicle 2 had dimmed completely, a bright spot reappeared at the same location. Hence, different types of release events were apparent in cultured neurons. Rapidly or slowly dimming fluorescent signals may reflect complete release followed by cargo diffusion and/or incomplete release followed by reacidification, as previously observed in non-neuronal cells (Holroyd et al., 2002; Taraska et al., 2003; Perrais et al., 2004). However, the persistent events appear to be a novel type of release event, which may be specific for neurons and/or Sema3A cargo (see below).Visualization of SemapHluorin secretion in neurons. \n\n, Movie frames (supplemental Movie 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) showing an axonal segment of a cortical neuron (DIV 22).

Black bar indicates duration of stimulus. Scale bar, 5 \u03bcm.Of the fusion events induced by K+ depolarization in each cell, 63 \u00b1 6% were transient (mean \u00b1 SEM;  = 172 events, 8 cells) (Fig. 3\n,; supplemental Movie 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) (see Materials and Methods for a definition of transient and persistent events). Similar results were obtained for electrical stimulation: 62 \u00b1 7% of the events were transient ( = 141 events, 9 cells) (Fig. 3\n). Transient events had an average decay time constant of 8.7 \u00b1 0.3 s for chemical (Fig. 3\n) and 4.7 \u00b1 0.3 s for electrical (Fig. 3\n) stimulation. Persistent events on the other hand remained visible as discrete spots for as long as 2 min after the stimulus had ended (Fig. 3\n,,; supplemental Movie 3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) and accounted for 36 \u00b1 6% of total events for chemical and 38.2 \u00b1 6.8% for electrical depolarization. Both types of events occurred at variable delays after onset of stimulus, but were rarely observed before depolarization (Fig. 3\n). A cumulative plot of the event duration (defined as the time \u0394/\n0 was above a threshold of 0.1) confirms the existence of at least two distinct classes of events (Fig. 3\n, inset). According to this criterion, transient events had an average duration of 12 \u00b1 2 s (109 events), whereas persistent events had an average duration of 84.2 \u00b1 6 s (62 events). Release after electrical stimulation was more protracted than the sharp peak observed after K+-induced release (Fig. 3\n), possibly because of a slower buildup of internal Ca2+ levels compared with K+-induced depolarization.Transient and persistent fusion events after secretion of SemapHluorin. \n\n, Movie frames illustrating representative transient (top; supplemental Movie 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) and persistent (bottom; supplemental Movie 3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) events after application of K+.

Solid bars and dashed bars indicate duration of K+ and 50 Hz stimulus, respectively. Scale bar, 2 \u03bcm.The increase in fluorescence after depolarization varied per event (Figs. 2\n, 3\n,). To determine whether this difference in fluorescence increase is caused by a difference in the amount of SemapHluorin cargo per vesicle, cells were sequentially stimulated with K+ and NH4Cl to reveal the total amount of SemapHluorin per vesicle (supplemental Fig. S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) (and see below). We quantified the ratio between the peak response in fluorescence after K+ and the peak response in fluorescence after NH4Cl for transient events that responded to both stimuli. The ratio between these two responses is 0.90 \u00b1 0.06 (mean \u00b1 SEM;  = 41 events, 15 cells), and the correlation coefficient \n2 of these two responses is 0.987 (supplemental Fig. S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), suggesting that the extent of fluorescence increase after K+ stimulation reflects the total amount of SemapHluorin cargo in the vesicle. The fluorescent events that appeared after depolarization displayed very little movement. Manual tracking of the center of persistent events for the first 30 s after their appearance showed that the spots moved on average 0.076 \u00b1 0.02 \u03bcm during this period (mean \u00b1 SEM;  = 42 events tracked, 3 cells), which is less than one pixel.To determine whether fusion of SemapHluorin vesicles depends on SNARE proteins, neurons were cotransfected with TeNT light chain-IRES-mRFP, which cleaves the vesicular SNARE protein synaptobrevin. As expected, expression of TeNT-IRES-mRFP abolished synaptic vesicle secretion in synaptopHluorin-expressing cells (Fig. 3\n). Similarly, SemapHluorin transient and persistent events were almost completely absent in neurons expressing TeNT ( = 5 events, 9 cells) (Fig. 3\n). In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, SemapHluorin events were also very rare ( = 3 events, 9 cells) (Fig. 3\n), again similar to the reduction in synaptic vesicle secretion (Fig. 3\n). Finally, SemapHluorin events did not require additional synaptic activation after K+-induced depolarization. The presence of AMPA and NMDA receptor antagonists (DNQX, 10 \u03bcm and AP5, 50 \u03bcm) did not alter the characteristics of SemapHluorin events ( = 108 events, 7 cells) (Fig. 3\n).To discriminate between complete release followed by cargo diffusion and incomplete release followed by resealing and reacidification, we performed three experiments. First, if SemapHluorin-containing vesicles reseal/reacidify after incomplete release, a subsequent instant application of NH4Cl should cause reappearance of dimming vesicles. Figure 4\n shows a typical transient event during depolarization. Instant application of NH4Cl caused the dimming vesicle to reappear and revealed at least two additional vesicles that had not responded to the K+ stimulus (Fig. 4\n,). Of 56 transient events analyzed, 63% reappeared after NH4Cl ( = 10 cells), suggesting that these events represent retrieval of secretory vesicles after incomplete release. The remaining 37% of transient events did not reappear after NH4Cl and probably reflect complete release. However, alternatives such as rapid movement of reacidifying vesicles out of the field of view during NH4Cl application cannot be completely excluded. To test this, we performed a second experiment introducing a brief \u201cacid wash,\u201d pH 5.5, directly after stimulation. If a transient event is caused by diffusion of SemapHluorin out of an open vesicle, acidification of the exterior should cause an instant decrease in fluorescence. Figure 4\n shows a representative transient event that appeared during stimulation and had started to dim. This vesicle continued to dim undisturbed without instant decrease in fluorescence during the subsequent acid wash (Fig. 4\n,). Hence, such events originate from endocytosed and reacidifying vesicles. Sixty-one percent of the transient events did not respond to acidification of the exterior ( = 33 events, 10 cells), whereas 39% did respond (Fig. 4\n, vesicle 2). The gradually decreasing fluorescence of vesicle 2, as well as the fluorescence of a neighboring bright vesicle (vesicle 1), was abruptly quenched after onset of the acid wash (Fig. 4\n,). The percentage of vesicles that did not respond to acidification (61%) is in good agreement with the percentage of vesicles that reappeared after NH4Cl application (63%).Retrieval of SemapHluorin vesicles after secretion during transient fusion events. \n\n, Movie frames show transient event (vesicle 2) during depolarization (KCl, 15 s).

The red trace (vesicle 1) has been aligned to the trace of vesicle 2 to reflect the loss of fluorescence after acid wash, causing an upward shift. \n\n, Bafilomycin blocks reacidification of synaptic vesicles. The same boutons were imaged before (gray trace) and after (black trace) application of 1 \u03bcm bafilomycin and stimulated with K+ ( = 56 boutons, 4 cells). SynaptopHluorin fluorescence is normalized to peak response. Bafilomycin caused a spontaneous alkalinization of synaptic vesicles (Sankaranarayanan and Ryan, 2001), causing the black trace to start at a negative value (traces normalized to the first 5 frames before stimulus). \n\n, Percentage transient and persistent SemapHluorin events in the same cells before (gray bars) and after (black bars) application of 1 \u03bcm bafilomycin ( = 287 events, 9 cells).

Scale bars: \n\n, 2.5 \u03bcm; (in \n\n) \n\n, \n\n, 2 \u03bcm.Third, we blocked vesicle reacidification by bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of the V-ATPase on secretory vesicles (Dr\u00f6se and Altendorf, 1997). This should abolish transient events caused by reacidification, but not those that reflect complete release and cargo diffusion. The effectiveness of bafilomycin was confirmed in synaptopHluorin-expressing neurons (Fig. 4\n) (Sankaranarayanan and Ryan, 2001). In the presence of bafilomycin, the percentage of transient SemapHluorin events was significantly reduced (65 \u00b1 7% transient events before vs 41 \u00b1 8% after bafilomycin treatment;  = 287 events, 9 cells;  < 0.01) (Fig. 4\n). This suggests that \u223c37% of all transient events, and 24% of all events, represent retrieval of vesicles after incomplete release. The remaining transient events in the presence of bafilomycin had a decay time \u03c4 = 4.9 \u00b1 0.3 s, which should represent the true diffusion kinetics of Sema3A out of the vesicle.Together these three experiments indicate that approximately one-third of all SemapHluorin fusion events (37\u201363% of the transient events; 24\u201340% of all events) (Fig. 4\n) represent incomplete release followed by resealing/reacidification. These values are in good agreement with previous data obtained in chromaffin and PC12 cells (Holroyd et al., 2002; Perrais et al., 2004). Another third of all events (23\u201340%) represents complete release followed by cargo diffusion out of the vesicle. The final third (37%) are persistent events (Fig. 4\n) (see below).The fact that the evoked fluorescence does not decay in one-third of SemapHluorin events suggests that this cargo remains continuous with the extracellular space after fusion. However, resealing vesicles may not always reacidify rapidly. To test this, a brief acid wash was applied directly after stimulation. Figure 5\n shows three persistent events during depolarization (vesicles 2, 3, and 4). These persistent events were instantly quenched after acid wash (Fig. 5\n,), indicating that the cargo remained accessible from the exterior. The majority of all persistent events responded to acid wash (81%;  = 48 events, 10 cells). The remaining persistent events probably represent resealed but slowly acidifying vesicles. Some bright fluorescent puncta (<5%) may not be functional secretory vesicles, but cargo in other (neutral) cellular compartments (Fig. 5\n, vesicle 1).Persistent events reflect stable deposits of SemapHluorin at the cell surface. \n\n, Movie frames of an axonal segment of SemapHluorin-expressing neuron. Vesicle 2 brightens and two new persistent events (vesicles 3 and 4) appear during depolarization (KCl, 15 s). These events abruptly disappear after acid wash (pH 5.5, 15 s), indicating that cargo is accessible from the exterior. \n\n, Fluorescence (\u0394/\n0) of the events indicated with colored arrowheads in \n\n.

Scale bars: \n\n, 5 \u03bcm; \n\n (for \n\n, \n\n), \n\n (for \n\n, \n\n), 2.5 \u03bcm.The depolarization-evoked persistent events may either represent vesicles that became fully integrated with the plasma membrane (stable deposits) or vesicles with a permanently open fusion pore. In neuroendocrine cells, larger proteins, such as tPA or phogrin, remain inside fusing vesicles for >1 min, whereas peptides, such as NPY, or lipophilic dyes, such as FM4-64, are rapidly lost (Taraska et al., 2003; Taraska and Almers, 2004). To test this possibility, we performed live labeling with a GFP antibody, which is comparable in size to tPA or phogrin and should therefore be too large to pass through such fusion pores. SemapHluorin-expressing neurons were imaged, depolarized, live labeled, and subsequently permeabilized and processed for MAP2 immunocytochemistry. Figure 5\n shows a persistent event that appeared during depolarization (vesicle 2) (Fig. 5\n,). The SemapHluorin cargo in the newly appeared persistent event was live labeled with the GFP antibody (Fig. 5\n). In addition, several bright vesicles that were visible before stimulation were also labeled (Fig. 5\n). MAP2 staining showed that the imaged neurite was an axon (Fig. 5\n). Dendritic persistent events were also live labeled (Fig. 5\n). Note that in this case vesicle 1, which was visible before stimulation, was not labeled (Fig. 5\n). Bright vesicles visible before stimulation may (see vesicle 1 in Fig. 5\n,) or may not (see vesicle 1 in Fig. 5\n, vesicle 1 in Fig. 5\n,) be accessible from the exterior of the cell, confirming that differences exist in acidification of secretory vesicles. Together, these data indicate that persistent release events represent stable deposits of cargo at the neuronal surface.Stable deposits may last for minutes (e.g., Fig. 3\n), but may eventually be followed by endocytosis. Occasionally, persistent events were observed that eventually started to dim and move out of the imaging region, suggesting that the vesicle underwent endocytosis and reacidification (supplemental Fig. S2 and supplemental Movie 4, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).Transient and persistent events occur alongside each other in one segment of a neuron (Figs. 2, 3). To test potential preferences of different types of events for specific neuronal compartments, we combined SemapHluorin imaging with dendritic and synaptic markers. First, SemapHluorin vesicles and release events localize to both axons and dendrites (Figs. 1, 5). In addition to release from neurites we also occasionally observed somatic release (data not shown). Second, SemapHluorin was coexpressed with synaptophysin-mCherry (syp-mCherry), a presynaptic marker (supplemental Fig. S3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), and SemapHluorin events and syp-mCherry distribution were imaged simultaneously. Figure 6\n shows a persistent axonal SemapHluorin event that overlapped with syp-mCherry fluorescence (Fig. 6\n), indicating that it occurred at a presynaptic bouton (Fig. 6\n). Figure 6\n shows a transient event (arrowheads) that did not colocalize with a syp-mCherry-labeled bouton (Fig. 6\n,), suggesting an extrasynaptic release site. Of all axonal events, 56 \u00b1 5% (mean \u00b1 SEM) occurred at synaptic terminals ( = 64 events, 6 cells). Neither transient nor persistent events showed preference for synaptic or extrasynaptic sites on axons ( > 0.05; Student's  test).Synaptic and extrasynaptic SemapHluorin fusion events. \n\n, Axonal SemapHluorin release. \n\n, Movie frames show a persistent SemapHluorin event (arrowheads). \n\n, Corresponding syp-mCherry signal. \n\n, Overlay of SemapHluorin at  = 0 s and syp-mCherry shows synaptic localization of the SemapHluorin event.

Note that two synaptically located SemapHluorin vesicles (asterisks) did not respond to depolarization. Scale bars: \n\n (for \n\n), \n\n (for \n\n), 2.5 \u03bcm.Third, as a complementary approach to specify the location of SemapHluorin release, neurons were loaded with the vital dye FM4-64 to label active presynaptic terminals and unloaded with a 60 s depolarizing stimulus. Imaged neurons were retrospectively immunostained with the dendritic marker MAP2 and carefully examined to rule out the presence of axonal SemapHluorin puncta in the imaged region. Figure 6\n shows a persistent SemapHluorin event from a MAP2-positive neurite that was closely apposed to an FM4-64-labeled bouton, suggesting that the release event occurred from a postsynaptic location. Like axonal release events, dendritic events were also observed at extrasynaptic locations (Fig. 6\n, arrowheads). Interestingly, two synaptically located SemapHluorin puncta in the same field of view did not respond to the depolarizing stimulus (Fig. 6\n, asterisks). In line with axonal release, 52 \u00b1 9% of all dendritic events occurred at synaptic locations ( = 58 events, 4 cells). There was no significant preference for transient or persistent events at either location ( > 0.05; Student's  test). The average synapse density on a dendritic arbor in our culture system is 0.15 synapse/\u03bcm dendrite, with an average synapse size of 1 \u03bcm (data not shown). Without taking dendritic volume in consideration, a random overlap of SemapHluorin events with synaptic sites would then be 15%. The 52% synaptic release that we observe suggests that secretory granules are actively recruited to synaptic sites, in line with reports from  (Shakiryanova et al., 2006). Thus, transient and persistent SemapHluorin events occur at synaptic as well as extrasynaptic sites, indicating that fusogenic SNARE complexes exist extrasynaptically.Secreted Sema3A binds to the extracellular matrix (ECM) (De Wit et al., 2005), which could function to attract or trap secreted SemapHluorin and explain the occurrence of stable deposits. To test this, we first tested whether excess glycosaminoglycans could interfere with Sema3A binding to the ECM. Application of heparin (0.1 mg/ml) to neuronal cultures 24 h before imaging efficiently competed with Sema3A for binding to the ECM, removing the characteristic Sema3A halo surrounding transfected neurons (data not shown). However, heparin treatment did not affect the ratio between transient and persistent events (Fig. 7). Next, we degraded essential components of the ECM using hyaluronidase (500 \u03bcU/ml) and chondroitinase ABC (0.1 U/ml) treatment for 24 and 2 h before imaging, respectively. Both enzymes efficiently removed secreted Sema3A bound to glial cells but did not affect the release mode (Fig. 7). Thus, secreted Sema3A binds to ECM components in cortical neurons, but this interaction does not affect the release characteristics of Sema3A.Ratio between transient and persistent events does not depend on the extracellular matrix. Heparin treatment (0.1 mg/ml for 24 h,  = 58 events, 6 cells) or enzymatic reduction of the ECM by chondroitinase ABC (0.1 U/ml for 2 h,  = 65 events, 7 cells) or hyaluronidase (500 \u03bcU/ml for 18 h,  = 53 events, 10 cells) does not affect the ratio between transient and persistent events (transient vs persistent events \u00b1 SEM for no treatment: 63.6 \u00b1 5.1% vs 38.2 \u00b1 4.2%; heparin: 60.3 \u00b1 10.2% vs 39.7 \u00b1 8.1%; chonABC: 65.8 \u00b1 9.3% vs 35.1 \u00b1 7.3%; hyaluronidase: 59.8 \u00b1 8.7% vs 39.8 \u00b1 6.8%).To determine whether the observed transient and persistent SemapHluorin fusion modes are a general feature of secretory granule release in neurons, we analyzed secretion of NPY, tPA, and BDNF. When coexpressed, Sema3A localizes to the same vesicles as NPY or tPA (de Wit et al., 2006) and BDNF (data not shown). SpH-tagged NPY, BDNF, and tPA showed a punctate localization in dendrites (Fig. 8\n) and axons (data not shown). NPY-SpH is a relatively small protein (\u223c34\u201342 kDa including SpH tag and depending on the degree of processing) compared with SemapHluorin (\u223c90\u2013130 kDa depending on processing). Imaging of NPY-SpH release revealed marked differences with SemapHluorin release. Figure 8\n shows a representative NPY-SpH vesicle that transiently brightened before rapidly disappearing, suggesting that the vesicle had emptied. The majority of NPY-SpH vesicles abruptly disappeared after depolarization (93 \u00b1 3%; mean \u00b1 SEM;  = 69 events, 7 cells) (Fig. 8\n). In rare cases, NPY-SpH vesicles remained bright for a prolonged period of time before suddenly disappearing (vesicle 1) (Fig. 8\n). The sparse occurrence of NPY-SpH persistent events (7 \u00b1 3% of total events) was in marked contrast to the incidence of SemapHluorin persistent events (36 \u00b1 6% of total events) (Fig. 8\n).The balance between transient and persistent fusion events depends on cargo type. \n\n, Punctate distribution of NPY-SpH, tPA-SpH, and BDNF-SpH (green) in MAP2-labeled dendrites (blue) of cortical neurons. \n\n, Movie frames and corresponding fluorescence (\u0394/\n0) of a representative transient NPY-SpH event.

Black bars indicate duration of K+ stimulus. \n\n, Graph showing percentage of transient (black bars) and persistent (gray bars) events for NPY-SpH, tPA-SpH, BDNF-SpH, and SemapHluorin vesicles. Scale bars: \n\n, 10 \u03bcm; (in \n\n) \n\n, 1 \u03bcm.We compared release of NPY and Sema3A with tPA-SpH (97 kDa), which leaves secretory granules more slowly than NPY in chromaffin cells (Perrais et al., 2004). Interestingly, tPA-SpH fusion events showed characteristics of both NPY and Sema3A release and were similar to the events observed in chromaffin cells (Perrais et al., 2004). Transiently brightening and abruptly disappearing vesicles, as observed for NPY, were also observed for tPA (Fig. 8\n). In addition, transient events occurred that were characterized by an abrupt increase in fluorescence and a rapid decay of fluorescence back to baseline levels, reminiscent of SemapHluorin transient events (Fig. 8\n). Figure 8\n shows an example of a persistent tPA-SpH event, followed by gradual reacidification of the vesicle. Persistent events accounted for 22 \u00b1 5% of total tPA-SpH fusion events ( = 93 events, 8 cells) (Fig. 8\n).The difference in ratio between transient and persistent events for NPY and tPA suggests that the molecular weight of the vesicle cargo determines the nature of fusion events after stimulus. Interestingly however, the fusion characteristics of BDNF-SpH (a protein similar in size to NPY-SpH with an estimated molecular weight of 58\u201343 kDa depending on the degree of processing) more closely resembled those of Sema3A than those of NPY (Fig. 8\n,). Persistent events constituted 26.5 \u00b1 7.2% of the total number of BDNF-SpH events ( = 102 events, 7 cells) (Fig. 8\n). Thus, although BDNF-SpH is similar in size to NPY, the fusion characteristics of BDNF are comparable to those of larger cargo proteins, suggesting that cargo protein-specific properties affect the balance between transient and persistent fusion events.Condensed vesicle cargo is packed inside secretory vesicles and interacts with charged luminal (glyco)proteins via polybasic domains (Kelly, 1985; Arvan and Castle, 1998). Sema3A contains such a basic domain at its C terminus (Luo et al., 1993). To test the importance of the interaction between cargo and vesicle matrix, we expressed a SemapHluorin construct lacking the basic domain (Sema\u0394BD) in cortical neurons. Sema\u0394BD was sorted to secretory vesicles, and NH4Cl application resulted in a marked increase in the fluorescence per vesicle and the number of visible vesicles (Fig. 9\n). Electrical stimulation resulted in secretory vesicle release similar to full-length SemapHluorin. However, the mode of release was now strongly shifted toward transient release (transient events: 84.2 \u00b1 7.9%, persistent events: 5.8 \u00b1 5.2%; mean \u00b1 SEM,  = 69 events, 12 cells). Hence, the interaction of Sema3A with luminal (glyco)proteins via its basic domain is an important determinant of the release mode and explains the occurrence of stable Sema3A deposits at the plasma membrane.Stable deposits depend on the interaction between Sema3A and the vesicle lumen. \n\n, \n\n, Cortical neuron expressing SemapHluorin without the C-terminal basic domain (Sema\u0394BD) before (\n\n) and after (\n\n) NH4Cl application. Like full-length SemapHluorin, Sema\u0394BD is targeted to acidic secretory vesicles, and NH4Cl application reveals numerous bright secretory vesicles. Note the complete absence of Sema\u0394BD binding to supporting glial cells. \n\n, The fourfold average vesicular fluorescence increase after NH4Cl application is similar to full-length SemapHluorin. Scale bars, 5 \u03bcm.Because the interaction of Sema3A with the luminal matrix can explain the occurrence of stable deposits, this interaction may also be able to trap other secreted molecules as stable deposits at the plasma membrane. To test whether Sema3A is capable of confining cosecreted molecules at the fusion site, we coexpressed Sema3A-mRFP with NPY-SpH. In neurons coexpressing Sema3A-mRFP and NPY-SpH, the majority of secretory vesicles contained both proteins (Fig. 10\n). If Sema3A is able to trap cosecreted NPY, the characteristic transient fusion mode of NPY should change to a more persistent mode. Indeed, coexpression of Sema3A-mRFP and NPY-SpH resulted in a dramatic, significant increase in the percentage of persistent NPY-SpH events (Fig. 10\n) as well as the duration of NPY-SpH release events (Fig. 10\n), whereas the number of events per cell was unaffected (Fig. 10\n). This suggests that corelease of Sema3A confines diffusible NPY molecules in stable deposits at the cell surface. To test whether this phenotype is specific for Sema3A, we coexpressed NPY-SpH with BDNF-mRFP or tPA-mRFP. Coexpression of these molecules did not affect the release characteristics of NPY-SpH (Fig. 10\n,). Thus, Sema3A released from secretory vesicles could function as crystallization point for the formation of signaling microdomains at the cell membrane.Sema3A changes the release characteristics of coexpressed NPY. \n\n, Graph showing percentage of transient (black bars) and persistent (gray bars) events after 50 Hz stimulation for NPY-SpH vesicles. Coexpression of Sema3A-mRFP but not tPA-mRFP or BDNF-mRFP changes NPY-SpH fusion mode from predominantly transient (96.6 \u00b1 2.4% transient, 3.4 \u00b1 2.4% persistent, mean \u00b1 SEM,  = 109 events, 16 cells) to almost evenly transient and persistent (52.4 \u00b1 8% transient, 46.3 \u00b1 8% persistent,  = 75 events, 10 cells, *** < 0.001) events. Coexpression of tPA-mRFP or BDNF-mRFP did not change this ratio (91 \u00b1 7.7% transient,  = 36 events, 7 cells and 87 \u00b1 6.7% transient,  = 61 events, 11 cells, respectively). \n\n, Sema3A-mRFP (red) and NPY-SpH (green) colocalize in secretory vesicles after coexpression in cortical neurons. Green and red channels were imaged with a 1 s interval, causing a small shift in alignment as a result of vesicle movement. \n\n, Graph showing average duration of all release events in neurons expressing NPY-SpH alone or together with Sema3A-mRFP, tPA-mRFP, or BDNF-mRFP. Coexpression of Sema3A-mRFP increases the average duration of all events from 23.1 \u00b1 2.4 s to 46.0 \u00b1 4.2 s (** < 0.01). Coexpression of tPA-mRFP or BDNF-mRFP did not change the average duration (18.8 \u00b1 3.3 s and 23.4 \u00b1 7.6 s, respectively). \n\n, Graph showing average number of release events per cell. Coexpression of Sema3A-mRFP, tPA-mRFP, or BDNF-mRFP did not change the number of NPY-SpH events per cell. Scale bar, 5 \u03bcm.In neurons, secretory granules mediate the regulated secretion of a diverse array of proteins with important roles in neuronal development and plasticity. Here, we characterized the different ways in which such cargo is secreted. In addition to transient events, which were previously observed in endocrine cells and represent either full release followed by cargo diffusion or incomplete release followed by vesicle retrieval, we also observed that certain cargo was delivered at the cell surface as stable deposits, depending on cargo type and interactions with the luminal matrix.Secretory granule exocytosis in neurons often appeared as bright fluorescent flashes along axons and dendrites, as the efflux of protons relieved quenching of SpH-tagged cargo. The subsequent gradual loss of fluorescence was attributable to two distinct phenomena: (1) diffusion of cargo protein out of the vesicle and (2) retrieval of vesicles after incomplete release, followed by reacidification. Similar release characteristics were previously observed in chromaffin, insulin-secreting, and PC12 cells (Tsuboi et al., 2000; Holroyd et al., 2002; Taraska et al., 2003; Perrais et al., 2004). Perrais et al. (2004) used the terms \u201cdischarge\u201d and \u201cdisplay\u201d to discriminate between full fusion and incomplete release during transient fusion pore opening. It is important to note that the stable deposits reported here differ from these \u201cdisplay\u201d events. For cargo favoring stable deposits, such as Sema3A and BDNF, we also observed both \u201cdisplay\u201d (transient opening) and \u201cdischarge\u201d (classical release) events, in addition to stable deposits. Stable deposits also occurred at locations of previous incomplete release events (e.g., vesicle 2 in Fig. 2), suggesting that a transient opening preceded the subsequent full fusion of single vesicles.In chromaffin cells, release of catecholamines and small neuropeptides such as NPY is very fast (Wightman et al., 1991; Perrais et al., 2004). In neurons, we observed similar fast NPY release. For tPA, slower release kinetics were more frequently observed (Fig. 8). These findings are consistent with the idea that cargo size influences the ratio between complete and incomplete release events (Perrais et al., 2004). However, cargo size is not a likely explanation for differences between transient events (both complete and incomplete release) and stable deposits (see below). Compared with the fast kinetics of NPY and tPA, release of BDNF and Sema3A was slow. Transient Sema3A events, as well as BDNF transient events (data not shown), were slow enough to be quenched by acid wash. Probably, interactions between such cargo and the luminal matrix prevent faster kinetics (see below), as previously suggested for the slow release of BDNF in synapses (Brigadski et al., 2005).Transient release events evoked by electrical stimulation had a lower time constant than those evoked by K+ stimulation, and approached the time constant in bafilomycin-treated cells. This suggests that in cells stimulated at a high frequency, a larger proportion of transient events represent classical release than retrieval. Hence, stimulation patterns may modulate the ratio between complete and incomplete release and thus the amount of cargo released (Balkowiec and Katz, 2000; G\u00e4rtner and Staiger, 2002).Persistent events accounted for a large proportion of Sema3A, BDNF, and tPA release events. The sensitivity of these events to acid wash indicates that deposited cargo remained exposed to the extracellular space. Therefore, we concluded that these events represent stable, local deposits of vesicle cargo at the cell surface. Alternatively, these events may be explained by assuming that the fusion pore remained open for minutes. It has been observed that transient (\u201cdisplay\u201d) events can last for tens of seconds (Perrais et al., 2004). However, the duration of the events in our study was even longer, sometimes existing for as long as recordings lasted (2 min). Moreover, the SpH-tagged cargo in these stable deposits was readily accessible for live labeling with a GFP antibody, making prolonged fusion pore openings an unlikely explanation. Hence, stable deposits are distinct from previously observed classical fusion and transient fusion pore openings, and may be neuron specific. One exception could be the prolonged extracellular association of FM-dye-binding cargo clusters in lactotrophs (Angleson et al., 1999). However, it seems most plausible that this cargo (prolactin) still needs to diffuse away to exert its biological function, in contrast to neuron-specific cargo such as neurotrophins and guidance cues (see below). Persistent events have also been observed in pancreatic \u03b2-cells, but resulted from the sequence of amino acids linking the cargo to the fluorescent reporter (Michael et al., 2004). The stable deposits we observe are unlikely to result from fluorescent protein tagging, because we used linkerless constructs.We found no evidence for differences in the secretion machinery to explain the differences between transient events and stable deposits. All events were Ca2+ and SNARE dependent. Second, we found no preference for either type of event at synaptic or extrasynaptic locations. Third, although certain cargo types bind to the ECM (De Wit et al., 2005), ECM manipulations did not alter the ratio between transient and stable events. Fourth, differences between transient events and stable deposits were not explained by cargo size. Cargo size is a likely explanation for differences among transient events (see above and Perrais et al., 2004). However, although BDNF-SpH and NPY-SpH have comparable molecular weights, their release was strikingly different, with BDNF favoring stable deposits. Hence, the differences between transient events and stable deposits appear to be primarily determined by specific physicochemical cargo properties.One specific property of the cargo types that give rise to stable deposits is their ability to interact with the granule matrix. BDNF and Sema3A are highly basic molecules (Barde et al., 1982; Luo et al., 1993), which probably interact with the proteoglycan components of the granule matrix (Kolset et al., 2004). Indeed, deletion of the basic domain of Sema3A abolished stable deposits. We conclude that the interactions between cargo and vesicle matrix components are preserved after integration of the vesicle into the plasma membrane to serve as focal signaling domains on the cell surface. The fluorescent intensity of stable deposits is surprisingly stable over the duration of recordings, suggesting that local capture is very efficient and that escape of Sema3A or BDNF from these deposits is minimal. The idea of local capture of signaling components by former secretory vesicle constituents was further strengthened after the coaccumulation of Sema3A and NPY in single vesicles. This changed the NPY release characteristics from transient events to the persistent events typical of cargo that interacts with the vesicle lumen, suggesting that corelease of Sema3A confines diffusible NPY molecules in stable deposits at the cell surface.The fact that regulated exocytosis of secretory vesicles containing Sema3A or BDNF generates local, stable deposits on the neuronal surface is consistent with the known cellular functions of these cargo types, e.g., guidance of processes and synapse formation/remodeling, which require highly localized signaling (Horch and Katz, 2002; Zhang and Poo, 2002; Sahay et al., 2005; Bouzioukh et al., 2006; Morita et al., 2006). Local accumulation of Sema3A on the neuronal surface has been observed for the endogenous protein (Eastwood et al., 2003; Good et al., 2004). The stable deposits reported here may also be related to the lingering extracellular presence of secreted BDNF (Brigadski et al., 2005) and the protease neurotrypsin (Frischknecht et al., 2008) in synapses. In these cases release was strictly synaptic and the extracellular presence may therefore be attributable to interactions with the ECM, which is concentrated at synapses (John et al., 2006).Each of the cargo types studied here was released by a combination of stable and transient events. The degree of cargo association with the granule matrix could vary between vesicles. Alkalinization solubilizes the granule matrix (Han et al., 1999), and this accelerates release (Brigadski et al., 2005). However, the intensity of transient and stable SemapHluorin events before fusion did not differ significantly (data not shown), suggesting that variations in intravesicular pH do not determine the release mode. Variations in the degree of cargo protein processing could affect release characteristics. Proteolytic processing of Sema3A generates a fragment that lacks the basic domain (Adams et al., 1997), which would favor transient events. It is also conceivable that intracellular second messengers influence the release mode: elevated calcium concentrations shift the preferred fusion mode in chromaffin cells (Al\u00e9s et al., 1999), and cAMP levels influence cargo solubilization and thereby release characteristics in lactotrophs (Angleson et al., 1999).A surprisingly large proportion of release events, \u223c50%, occurred at extrasynaptic locations on axons and dendrites. Fusing secretory vesicles outside synapses have previously been observed in dendrites using electron microscopy (Zhu et al., 1986) and live imaging (Hartmann et al., 2001), and from the somata of substantia nigra neurons using amperometry (Jaffe et al., 1998). Although overexpression of cargo may influence the synaptic/extrasynaptic ratio, these data confirm that secretory granule release does not require a specialized active zone and that fusogenic SNARE complexes exist outside synapses.This work was supported by grants from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (GBMW 903-42-023 to R.F.T., GpD 970-10-036 to M.V., ZonMW Veni Grant 016-066-101 to R.F.T., and ZonMW-Pionier Grant 900-01-001 to M.V.), The NeuroBsik Mouse Phenomics Consortium (BSIK03053), and the European Commission (the EUSynapse project, LSHM-CT-2005-019055).

Ultrastructurally, presynaptic boutons lack obvious physical barriers that separate them from the axon proper, yet activity-related and constitutive dynamics continuously promote the \u201creshuffling\u201d of presynaptic components and even their dispersal into flanking axonal segments. How presynaptic sites manage to maintain their organization and individual characteristics over long durations is thus unclear. Conceivably, presynaptic tenacity might depend on the active zone (AZ), an electron-dense specialization of the presynaptic membrane, and particularly on the cytoskeletal matrix associated with the AZ (CAZ) that could act as a relatively stable \u201ccore scaffold\u201d that conserves and dictates presynaptic organization. At present, however, little is known on the molecular dynamics of CAZ molecules, and thus, the factual basis for this hypothesis remains unclear. To examine the stability of the CAZ, we studied the molecular dynamics of the major CAZ molecule Bassoon in cultured hippocampal neurons. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and photoactivation experiments revealed that exchange rates of green fluorescent protein and photoactivatable green fluorescent protein-tagged Bassoon at individual presynaptic sites are very low (\u03c4 > 8 h). Exchange rates varied between boutons and were only slightly accelerated by stimulation. Interestingly, photoactivation experiments revealed that Bassoon lost from one synapse was occasionally assimilated into neighboring presynaptic sites. Our findings indicate that Bassoon is engaged in relatively stable associations within the CAZ and thus support the notion that the CAZ or some of its components might constitute a relatively stable presynaptic core scaffold.The majority of presynaptic sites in the mammalian CNS appear as small varicosities (presynaptic boutons) distributed along axons. Synaptic connections arranged in this form (en passant synapses) allow a single axon to contact multiple postsynaptic cells as it courses through the neuropil. At the ultrastructural level, presynaptic boutons lack obvious physical barriers that separate their presynaptic structures from the cytoplasm and membrane of the axon proper (Shepherd and Harris, 1998). At the functional level, however, numerous processes, often associated with presynaptic activity, promote the dynamic \u201creshuffling\u201d of presynaptic constituents and even their dispersal into flanking axonal segments. For example, presynaptic activity is associated with the mobilization of many, perhaps hundreds of synaptic vesicles (SVs) (Ryan and Smith, 1995; Kraszewski et al., 1996; Harata et al., 2001) with the rapid dispersal of presynaptic proteins such as Synapsin and Rab3 (Chi et al., 2001, 2003; Star et al., 2005) and with the deposition of SV membrane proteins on the axonal plasma membrane, some of which wander away, only to reappear in nearby boutons (Sankaranarayanan and Ryan, 2000, 2001; Li and Murthy; 2001; Fern\u00e1ndez-Alfonso et al., 2006; Wienisch and Klingauf 2006). At longer timescales, packets of SVs (Darcy et al., 2006), active zonal material (Krueger et al., 2003), and synaptic matrix proteins (Tsuriel et al., 2006) migrate along the axon from one presynaptic site to another. Despite these dynamics and the lack of obvious physical barriers, mammalian CNS presynaptic sites do persist for long periods (De Paola et al., 2006; Stettler et al., 2006) and (as far as we know) do not eventually equilibrate and become identical in size, composition, or function (Murthy et al., 1997; Staple et al., 2000; Geracitano et al., 2007). How do synapses maintain their individual functionalities? What is the basis for the tenacity exhibited by the minute and dynamic presynaptic specialization?The presynaptic plasma membrane contains an electron-dense thickening, known as the active zone (AZ), which contains a dense meshwork of structural proteins known as the cytoskeletal matrix associated with the AZ (CAZ) (Schoch and Gundelfinger, 2006). The CAZ is remarkably resistive to chemical extraction procedures, and many of its constituents seem to be engaged in high-affinity interactions. These characteristics suggest that the CAZ may function as a \u201ccore scaffold\u201d that specifies and maintains the position of presynaptic, cytosolic, and membranal molecules while providing a positional reference and \u201canchoring\u201d site for molecular mesh works that cluster SVs at presynaptic boutons. It is therefore conceivable that presynaptic tenacity is based to a large degree on the tenacity of the CAZ.Somewhat unexpectedly, a recent study revealed that the CAZ protein Munc13-1 exhibits relatively rapid exchange rates (\u03c4 of \u22481 h), which could indicate that the CAZ is more dynamic than previously conceived (Kalla et al., 2006). Munc13-1, however, has also been shown to dynamically translocate to the plasma membrane in response to phorbol-ester binding (Betz et al., 1998), which indicates that Munc13-1 is not as tightly associated with the AZ as other CAZ molecules may be. Indeed, the CAZ contains additional components, some of which seem less likely to exhibit such rapid dynamics. These include Piccolo and Bassoon, very large and related proteins of 560 and 420 kDa, respectively (tom Dieck et al., 1998; Fenster et al., 2000). These molecules are found in molecular complexes that can be also immunoprecipitated together with postsynaptic proteins (Husi et al., 2000), are not lost in conditions that cause the dissociation of many presynaptic AZ proteins (Phillips et al., 2001), and, unlike other AZ molecules, do not change their ultrastructural distribution after stimulation (Tao-Cheng, 2006). We therefore set out to examine the cellular dynamics of one of these proteins, namely Bassoon, to determine whether it is a significantly more stable CAZ component and thus lend credence to the idea that the CAZ or some of its components might constitute a relatively stable, presynaptic core scaffold.Hippocampal cell cultures were prepared from 1- to 2-d-old Sprague Dawley rats as described previously (Tsuriel et al., 2006). Neurons were used for experiments 14\u201325 d after plating. Reagents were procured from the following sources: 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) was from Tocris Bioscience; 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5) was from Sigma; and FM4-64 (-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(-dibutylaminostyryl)pyridinium, dibromide) was from Invitrogen.The GFP:Bsn95-3938 construct used here was described previously (Dresbach et al., 2003). PAGFP:Bsn95-3938 was prepared by substituting green fluorescent protein (GFP) with photoactivatable GFP (PAGFP) (a generous gift from Dr. Lippincott-Schwartz, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Bethesda, MD). In both constructs, Bsn95-3938 expression was driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter. Expression of fusion proteins was performed by calcium phosphate transfection on days 7\u201310  as described previously (Bresler et al., 2004). Coexpression of PAGFP:Bsn95-3938 and cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) was performed in a similar manner using a 9:1 mixture of the two vectors precipitated by ethanol and resuspended in distilled water.Fluorescence and differential interference contrast (DIC) images were acquired using a custom-designed confocal laser scanning microscope (Tsuriel et al., 2006) using a 40\u00d7, 1.3 numerical aperture Fluar objective. CFP and enhanced GFP (EGFP)/PAGFP/FM4-64 were excited using the 457 and 488 nm lines of an argon laser (JDS Uniphase), respectively. Fluorescence emissions were read using 467\u2013493 (CFP), 500\u2013545 (EGFP/PAGFP) nm bandpass, and >630 nm (FM4-64) long-pass filters (Chroma Technology). Photoactivation was performed using a 405 nm diode laser (Coherent). Time-lapse recordings were performed by averaging three to six frames at two to three focal planes spaced 1\u20131.5 \u03bcm apart. All data were collected at a resolution of 640 \u00d7 480 pixels, at 12 bits/pixel, with the confocal aperture fully open. Some long-term fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and all photoactivation experiments were performed without replacing the growth media (no perfusion), in a sterile atmospheric mixture of 5% CO2 and 95% air. The majority of FRAP experiments were performed in a laminar flow perfusion insert mounted in a modified heated chamber (Warner Instruments) and perfused with preheated Tyrode's saline solution (in mm: 119 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 25 HEPES, and 30 glucose, pH 7.4) containing CNQX (10 \u03bcm) and AP-5 (50 \u03bcm). Data were collected at predetermined time intervals, with focal drift corrected before collecting each image stack using the microscope systems \u201cautofocus\u201d feature. Stimulation, FM4-64 labeling, photobleaching, and photoactivation were performed as described previously (Tsuriel et al., 2006).FRAP experiments were followed by fixation in 4% formaldehyde and 120 mm sucrose in PBS for 20 min, followed by permeabilization for 10 min in fixative solution containing 0.25% Triton X-100 (Sigma). Cells were washed three times in PBS, incubated in 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies (guinea pig anti-ProSAP2) (Bresler et al., 2004) in PBS and 1% BSA. Cells were rinsed three times for 10 min with PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies [cyanine 5 (Cy5) conjugated donkey anti-guinea pig (Jackson ImmunoResearch)] in PBS and 1% BSA. The cells were rinsed again with PBS, mounted, and imaged immediately. Location of photobleached boutons in immunolabeled specimens was performed as described previously (Bresler et al., 2004). Images were collected by averaging three frames at six sections spaced 0.5 \u03bcm apart with the confocal aperture nearly fully closed. Cy5 fluorescence was recorded at 633 nm excitation (helium\u2013neon 633 line)/>640 emission.All data analysis was performed using software (OpenView) written for this purpose by one of the us (N.E.Z.). Analysis was performed on maximal intensity projections of -section stacks. Intensities of fluorescent puncta were measured as mean pixel values in 10 \u00d7 10 pixel rectangular regions centering on them. FRAP data normalization, correction for ongoing photobleaching, and fitting of recovery curves were performed as described previously (Tsuriel et al., 2006). Normalization of quantitative photoactivation data were performed as follows: Recovery = ( \u2212 )/( \u2212 ), where  is the fluorescence of a PAGFP: Bsn95-3938 punctum before photoactivation,  is the fluorescence of the same punctum immediately after photoactivation, and  is the fluorescence of that punctum at time .Final images were prepared using Adobe Photoshop and Microsoft PowerPoint.To study the rates at which Bassoon is lost from and reincorporated into the CAZ of individual presynaptic sites, we expressed a GFP-tagged variant of Bassoon (GFP:Bsn95-3938) in hippocampal neurons obtained from newborn rats and grown in culture for at least 2 weeks. This slightly truncated variant of Bassoon was shown previously to be targeted correctly to presynaptic sites (Dresbach et al., 2003, 2006) and was used to study the recruitment of Bassoon to new presynaptic sites (Bresler et al., 2004). When expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons, GFP:Bsn95-3938 exhibits a punctate distribution pattern (Fig. 1). In these rather mature preparations, most GFP:Bsn95-3938 puncta are relatively stable and correspond to functional presynaptic sites (Bresler et al., 2004), although some smaller (and dimmer) mobile puncta are also observed.Expression of GFP:Bsn95-3938 in cultured hippocampal neurons. , Fluorescence image of an axon belonging to a neuron expressing GFP:Bsn95-3938. , DIC image of the same region. , Fluorescence image overlaid on the DIC image. Note the bright puncta at intersection points between axonal arbors and dendrites. Most such puncta represent functional presynaptic sites; 14 d . Scale bar, 10 \u03bcm.The loss and reincorporation rates of GFP:Bsn95-3938 at individual presynaptic sites were measured by FRAP. To that end, neurons expressing GFP:Bsn95-3938 were placed in a laminar flow chamber and maintained at 33\u201335\u00b0C in a physiological solution. After collecting baseline images, three to five fluorescent puncta were selectively bleached by high-intensity 488 nm laser light (Tsuriel et al., 2006), after which fluorescence recovery was monitored by collecting image stacks (two to three sections) at rates of one image every 5\u201310 min for \u223c2 h (Fig. 2,). To verify that the photobleached puncta represented functional presynaptic sites and that this functionality was retained after the photobleaching procedure, field stimulation (30 s at 10 Hz) was used to label all boutons with the fluorescent functional endocytosis marker FM4-64. Only GFP:Bsn95-3938 puncta that exhibited a capacity to uptake FM4-64 after the labeling procedure and subsequently release it after a second stimulation episode (120 s at 10 Hz) were included in our analysis (Fig. 2).Loss and reincorporation rates of GFP:Bsn95-3938 at individual presynaptic boutons. , Axons of neurons expressing GFP:Bsn95-3938. Three GFP:Bsn95-3938 puncta, one in each rectangular region, were selected for photobleaching. Scale bar, 10 \u03bcm. , The three puncta were selectively photobleached by high-intensity laser light (arrowheads), and fluorescence recovery at these sites was subsequently followed by time-lapse imaging. Fluorescence levels shown in false color according to color scale near the bottom. , At the end of the experiment, presynaptic boutons were labeled with FM4-64 by field stimulation (\u201cload\u201d; 30 s at 10 Hz), followed by unloading (\u201cunld\u201d; 120 s at 10 Hz) to verify the functionality of the photobleached GFP:Bsn95-3938. Note that all three photobleached puncta (green channel, bottom panels) exhibited a capacity for both FM4-64 endocytosis and exocytosis. , Fluorescence recovery time course for the three photobleached puncta, after correcting for ongoing photobleaching (see Results). Note that whereas bouton 1 exhibited significant recovery, boutons 2 and 3 exhibited very little recovery over the same period.As shown in Figure 2, fluorescence recovery varied significantly from one bouton to another. Whereas fluorescence recovery was quite significant in some boutons (for example, bouton 1 in Fig. 2), in others it was much slower (boutons 2, 3). Because the imaging procedure itself was associated with some degree of photobleaching, we corrected the recovery data of the photobleached boutons according to the slight photobleaching exhibited by \u201cnaive\u201d boutons in the same fields of view (Tsuriel et al., 2006). Even with this correction, however, fluorescence recovery remained variable.The recovery process was also qualitatively variable: a minority (approximately one-quarter) of photobleached boutons exhibited gradual and monotonic recovery, but the majority exhibited somewhat erratic recovery patterns, occasionally involving stepwise changes in fluorescence (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). However, when data from all experiments (26 boutons, 14 fields of view, 5 separate experiments) were pooled together, an apparently smooth recovery curve emerged (Fig. 3). Assuming the existence of two GFP:Bsn95-3938 pools with fast and slow exchange rates, this curve could be fit to two exponentials with time constants of 5 and 245 min and pool ratios of \u223c1:4, respectively (Tsuriel et al., 2006). An extrapolation of this curve indicates that, on average, individual presynaptic sites exchange their entire pool of GFP:Bsn95-3938 every 16\u201318 h (Fig. 3).GFP:Bsn95-3938 recovery rates are highly variable. , Mean recovery time course for all photobleached GFP:Bsn95-3938 puncta. Note the variability of fluorescence recovery rates as evident from the SDs (errors bars). The data were fit according to a model that assumed two GFP:Bsn95-3938 pools with different recovery kinetics (Tsuriel et al., 2006). The best fit was obtained with time constants of 5 min (fast pool) and 245 min (slow pool) and a fast/slow pool ratio of \u223c1:4, respectively. , Extrapolation of the best fit curve indicates that, on average, the entire content of GFP:Bsn95-3938 at individual presynaptic boutons is replaced every 16\u201318 h. , Photobleached puncta grouped according to degree of recovery observed after 2 h. , Recovery of fluorescence in boutons stimulated at 20 Hz for 20 s every 3 min compared with controls in which no stimulation was performed (means \u00b1 SEM). Recovery rates in the stimulated population were, on average, slightly faster than those of the control population. Stimulation was also associated with a shift in the bouton population toward boutons that exhibited greater recovery over a 1 h period (inset).Several reservations are important to mention. First, the time constant calculated for the slowly exchanging (and major) GFP:Bsn95-3938 pool is based on an extrapolation of data obtained for the first 2 h of a much longer process and thus is quite sensitive to relatively small errors in measured (and corrected) recovery rates, mainly those made at later times (near the 2 h mark). It thus should be acknowledged that this time constant is probably somewhat inaccurate. Second, the time constants above represent only average values; individual boutons exhibited a range of recovery rates, as evidenced by the error bars in Figure 3. In fact, approximately one-quarter of the boutons exhibited very little (<30%) recovery over 2 h, whereas the remainder exhibited intermediate (30\u201370%) to substantial (>70%) recovery over the same period (Fig. 3). In these populations, the mean slow time constants were >20, 3.7, and 1.3 h, respectively.Variability of exchange rates at different boutons occurred across different experiments, different cells in the same dish, and different boutons along the same axons (although to a somewhat lesser degree). We did not find consistent relationships between GFP:Bsn95-3938 exchange rates and initial GFP:Bsn95-3938 puncta size (data not shown). To explore potential relationships between GFP:Bsn95-3938 exchange rates and SV recycling, we performed additional FRAP experiments ending with FM4-64 labeling by 2- or 120-s-long stimuli trains at 10 Hz, but no consistent relationships were found between FM4-64 labeling and GFP:Bsn95-3938 exchange rates at the same boutons (data not shown). We also explored the possibility that some of the variability might have stemmed from the inclusion of presynaptic sites lacking postsynaptic counterparts (\u201corphan synapses\u201d) (Krueger et al., 2003) in our analysis. To that end, we performed an additional set of FRAP experiments, after which the cells were fixed and labeled with antibodies against the postsynaptic density protein ProSAP2 (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Of the 17 individually photobleached GFP:Bsn95-3938 puncta identified with absolute certainty, only two (11%) were not juxtaposed against a cluster of ProSAP2 (10 fields of view, 4 separate experiments). The recovery exhibited by these boutons was not remarkably different from the other 15. Furthermore, the distribution of recoveries exhibited by ProSAP2-associated GFP:Bsn95-3938 puncta was similar to that observed for the entire population (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). These findings thus do not support the possibility that the variability in recovery rates we observed stemmed from the inclusion of orphan presynaptic sites in our analysis.If Bassoon is part of a relatively stable presynaptic scaffold, it might be expected that the interactions it is engaged in would be rather indifferent to the intense dynamics induced by activity. We thus compared, in pairwise manner, Bassoon exchange rates in preparations in which spontaneous activity was blocked by application of CNQX (10 \u03bcm) and AP-5 (50 \u03bcm), with exchange rates in preparations stimulated periodically in the presence of the same antagonists (20 s at 20 Hz, every 3 min; stimulation beginning immediately after collecting the first post-photobleach images). Here too we observed significant variability in fluorescence recovery patterns and rates ( = 44 and 29 boutons; nonstimulated and stimulated, respectively, 17 separate experiments), yet when average recovery rates were plotted against each other (Fig. 3), a small but statistically significant increase in fluorescence recovery rates was observed for the stimulated population ( = 0.036, ANOVA with repeated measures). In addition, stimulation was associated with a shift in the bouton population toward more substantial recovery over the same period (Fig. 3, inset). Thus, Bassoon exchange rates are not entirely indifferent to presynaptic activation, but the effects are relatively modest.The FRAP experiments described so far consistently indicated that the exchange time constant for the slowly exchanging GFP:Bsn95-3938 pool is on the order of several hours. However, as discussed above, these FRAP-based estimates were probably somewhat inaccurate. We thus used a second method to measure the kinetics of the slowly exchanging GFP:Bsn95-3938, namely fluorescence recovery after photoactivation (FRAPA). To that end, we substituted the EGFP moiety of GFP:Bsn95-3938 with PAGFP (Patterson and Lippincott-Schwartz, 2002) and transfected neurons with this fusion protein. Because PAGFP is practically invisible before photoactivation, CFP was cotransfected with PAGFP:Bsn95-3938 to allow us to locate and select putative presynaptic sites for photoactivation (Fig. 4) (Tsuriel et al., 2006). Spatially confined, high-intensity illumination at 405 nm was then used to photoactivate PAGFP:Bsn95-3938 at these sites, and the decay of photoactivated PAGFP:Bsn95-3938 fluorescence was then followed by time-lapse microscopy.Loss and reincorporation rates of PAGFP:Bsn95-3938 measured by FRAPA. , Axons of neurons expressing both CFP and PAGFP:Bsn95-3938 (CFP channel is shown). Several rectangular regions containing distinct varicosities were selected for photoactivation. Scale bar, 10 \u03bcm. , Boutons that were selectively photoactivated by brief, high-intensity illumination at 405 nm (regions enclosed in yellow rectangles in ). Fluorescence decay at these sites was subsequently followed by time-lapse imaging. Full-field photoactivation performed at the end of the experiments greatly increased fluorescence levels at these sites, indicating that the reduction in fluorescence observed during the experiments was not entirely attributable to photobleaching but was, at least in part, attributable to the dissociation of photoactivated PAGFP:Bsn95-3938 and replacement with nonphotoactivated PAGFP:Bsn95-3938. Fluorescence levels shown in false color according to color scale in Figure 2. , Mean fluorescence decay time course for all photoactivated PAGFP:Bsn95-3938 puncta and fit to two exponentials. , Photoactivated puncta grouped according to the degree of recovery observed after 2 h.Although FRAPA and FRAP are conceptually equivalent, photobleaching associated with time-lapse imaging breaks the symmetry of these two methods: in FRAP, photobleaching leads to an underestimation of recovery rates, whereas in FRAPA, it leads to an overestimation of exchange rates. Furthermore, the bleaching rate of photoactivated PAGFP:Bsn95-3938 was found to be approximately twice as large as that of GFP:Bsn95-3938 (supplemental Fig. 3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Finally, in FRAP, errors arising from photobleaching are more significant near the end of the recovery phase (which is critical for correct estimations of slow exchange rates), whereas in FRAPA, such errors are extremely significant at initial phases of recovery (this is demonstrated in an interactive spreadsheet provided as supplemental data, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). We thus optimized the experimental protocol to match the advantages and disadvantages of FRAPA. Specifically, we used FRAPA to measure the exchange kinetics of the slowly exchanging (PA)GFP:Bsn95-3938 pool by following the decay of photoactivated PAGFP:Bsn95-3938 fluorescence at very low sampling rates (one image per hour) for 13\u201320 h, purposely ignoring the decay kinetics during the first 1\u20132 h. As shown in Figure 4, fluorescence decay occurred over many hours. When data from all experiments were pooled together (45 boutons, 8 cells, 5 separate experiments), the mean decay plots could be fit to two exponentials (Fig. 4). The time constant for the \u201cfast\u201d pool is of no significance because the initial recovery period was undersampled for reasons explained above. However, the sampling rates and durations were well suited for measuring the exchange rates of the slowly exchanging pool, and thus the time constant measured for this component, 501 min (>8 h), is quite reliable. When bringing into account the fact that FRAPA-based measurements inherently overestimate exchange rates, these experiments strongly confirm and extend the previous conclusion (Fig. 3) that the loss and reincorporation rates of presynaptic bassoon are indeed very slow. It should be noted that significant variability in the exchange rates of different boutons was also evident in FRAPA experiments (Fig. 4), although it was slightly less pronounced, probably as a result of the low sampling rates and the fact that no compensation for ongoing bleaching was performed.Previous studies have shown that some presynaptic proteins are continuously exchanged among nearby presynaptic boutons (Sankaranarayanan and Ryan, 2000, 2001; Li and Murthy, 2001; Darcy et al., 2006; Fern\u00e1ndez-Alfonso et al., 2006; Tsuriel et al., 2006; Wienisch and Klingauf 2006) (for review, see Staras, 2007). Are CAZ molecules interchanged as well? Can Bassoon lost from one presynaptic locus migrate to nearby presynaptic sites and assimilate into the CAZ at these loci? To examine this possibility, we photoactivated PAGFP:Bsn95-3938 in small groups of presynaptic boutons (Fig. 5,) and followed the redistribution of photoactivated PAGFP:Bsn95-3938 by time-lapse imaging (Fig. 5). In 8 of 14 experiments (7 different preparations), photoactivated PAGFP:Bsn95-3938 was clearly observed to accumulate at AZs residing outside the originally photoactivated region (Fig. 5). We were interested to determine the mode of PAGFP:Bsn95-3938 accumulation at these sites: did fluorescence increase gradually and monotonically, or was material shuttled to these sites in the form of mobile packets as shown previously to occur during synaptogenesis (Krueger et al., 2003; Shapira et al., 2003; Bresler et al., 2004; Dresbach et al., 2006; Tao-Cheng, 2007)? Indeed, mobile packets of photoactivated PAGFP:Bsn95-3938 were occasionally observed to move inside and away from the photoactivation regions (for example, see  = 68 in Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). To that end, we repeated these experiments at higher temporal resolutions better matched to axonal transport processes (two to four images per minute). However, at these sampling rates, photobleaching reduced the fluorescence of photoactivated PAGFP:Bsn95-3938 to very low levels within 10\u201320 min (supplemental Fig. 3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), and ultimately we were not able to determine with absolute certainty that such packets were a major source of photoactivated PAGFP:Bsn95-3938 that accumulated at nonphotoactivated AZs (>15 separate experiments). We thus conclude that, in common with other presynaptic (and postsynaptic) molecules studied so far, Bassoon seems to be interchanged among nearby synapses, although the mode of interchanging remains uncertain.Redistribution of PAGFP:Bsn95-3938 among nearby synapses.

Note the appearance of photoactivated PAGFP:Bsn95-3938 at presynaptic sites residing outside of the photoactivated region (arrow and arrowhead). Also apparent is the significant reduction in fluorescence of all photoactivated boutons, probably attributable to a combination of photobleaching caused by recurrent imaging and the ongoing exchange of photoactivated PAGFP:Bsn95-3938 with nonphotoactivated PAGFP:Bsn95-3938 from sources outside the photoactivated region.The molecular dynamics associated with SV release on the one hand and the lack of obvious structural barriers that confine presynaptic components to presynaptic compartments on the other would seem to seriously challenge the stability and tenacity of the presynaptic bouton. In this study, we examined the molecular dynamics exhibited by Bassoon, one of the largest CAZ molecules, to examine the possibility that the CAZ or some of its components might function as a relatively stable \u201ccore scaffold\u201d that defines and maintains the characteristics and organization of the presynaptic site.Both FRAP and photoactivation experiments strongly indicate that the exchange rates of (PA)GFP:Bsn95-3938 at individual presynaptic sites are relatively low. The actual estimates of the slow component exchange rate differed somewhat in FRAP and FRAPA experiments. However, for reasons explained above, the FRAPA experiments were much better suited for estimating these slow exchange rates. Furthermore, because FRAPA measurements inherently overestimate exchange rates, our conclusion that Bassoon exchange rates are relatively slow (time constant >8 h) seems to be well founded. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, these exchange rates are the lowest reported to date for any (pre) synaptic protein. We stress, however, that this figure should not be taken too literally for several reasons: (1) significant variability was observed in the recovery rates of individual boutons; (2) the fusion proteins used here lack the first 94 aa of native Bassoon (and the myristolization sites found within this segment); and (3) the fusion protein has a 30 kDa protein (GFP or PAGFP) appended to its N terminus. Finally, this number is undoubtedly affected by the preparation used here. Aside from the fact that the experiments were performed in a reduced system (cell culture), they were performed in neurons that are relatively immature (2\u20134 weeks ) compared with those in the mature rat brain. Given a recent  study showing that the exchange dynamics of a postsynaptic protein (PSD-95) decrease with age (Gray et al., 2006), the exchange rates reported here are likely to overestimate the exchange rates of Bassoon in the mature brain. However, even if the rates reported here are overestimates, they are still several orders of magnitude slower than the timescales typically associated with SV recycling, as well as Synapsin I, actin, Rab3, and SV protein redistribution, and suggest that at least some CAZ components are engaged in relatively stable associations. This conclusion is also supported by our finding that GFP:Bsn95-3938 exchange rates are only mildly affected by strong stimulation (Fig. 3), as would be expected for a relatively stable protein complex whose protein\u2013protein interactions are not significantly weakened by activity and the SV recycling dynamics it entails. Thus, at least some components of the CAZ appear to be part of a relatively stable scaffold that might serve metaphorically as \u201can island of stability in a sea of change\u201d that defines, conserves, and maintains the location, size, and individual characteristics of each presynaptic site, at least on a 5\u201310 h timescale.The relatively slow exchange rates of Bassoon are consistent with the possibility that these reflect rates of Bassoon degradation and incorporation of newly synthesized protein. However, our photoactivation experiments (Fig. 5) indicate that Bassoon, in common with other presynaptic and postsynaptic molecules such as Synapsin I, ProSAP2, and PSD-95 (Gray et al., 2006; Tsuriel et al., 2006), can migrate from one synaptic locus to another and assimilate into the synaptic matrices at these sites, strengthening the notion that nearby synapses share, and perhaps compete over, local pools of such molecules (for review, see Staras, 2007). Interestingly, a retrospective immunohistochemical analysis of migrating SV packets (Krueger et al., 2003) (see also Tao-Cheng, 2007) indicates that Bassoon might migrate between nearby synapses in the form of transport packets containing unitary amounts of AZ material and SVs (\u201corphan release sites\u201d). Our observations of small mobile PAGFP:Bsn95-3938 puncta migrating between synapses is consistent this mode of material exchange, as are the stepwise increases in fluorescence we observed in some FRAP experiments (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). It is not clear to us, however, that this exchange mode is exclusive. We did observe relatively rapid and monotonous fluorescence recovery in some FRAP experiments, which could point to the existence of small pools of soluble Bassoon. In this respect, it is worth noting that photoactivation also exposed what seems to be dim diffuse axonal fluorescence (Figs. 4, 5), which could represent pools of soluble PAGFP:Bsn95-3938 or numerous, very small clusters of this protein.In mice deficient for Bassoon, ribbon complexes of retinal photoreceptor synapses lose their anchoring to the presynaptic membrane (Dick et al., 2003). Conversely, presynaptic structure of glutamatergic synapses is not grossly affected, yet a large fraction of these are functionally inactive (Altrock et al., 2003). Experiments in which RNA interference was used to suppress Bassoon or Piccolo expression reveal that neither are essential for synapse formation but indicate that Piccolo (but not Bassoon) is involved in SV retention and mobilization (Leal-Ortiz et al., 2008). At present, this and other data provide tantalizing, yet not necessarily coherent, hints as to the role of the CAZ and its components in maintaining presynaptic organization and functional characteristics. We expect that future experiments in which presynaptic tenacity will be explored over longer timescales (days, weeks) in wild-type and genetically perturbed neurons will clarify the relationships between the CAZ, its composition, and presynaptic tenacity.This work was supported by United States Israel Binational Science Foundation Grant 2003176 (C.C.G., N.E.Z.), Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft Grants Dr 373/3-1, Dr 373/3-2, and Dr 373/3-3 (T.D., N.E.Z.), and National Institutes of Health Grants NS39471 and NS353862 (C.C.G.).

Electrophysiological work has dissociated match and mismatch signals in the monkey perirhinal cortex, where match signals were selective for matches to goal states, whereas mismatch signals were not modulated by intention (Miller and Desimone, 1994). To investigate whether the theoretically important relational match and mismatch signals in the hippocampus are modulated by goal states, we fully crossed whether a probe stimulus relationally matched or mismatched a previously perceived image or goal state. Subjects performed two working memory tasks in which they either responded \u201cyes\u201d to probes that were identical to the previous sample scene or, after performing a relational manipulation of the scene, responded \u201cyes\u201d only to a probe that was identical to this perceptually novel image. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found evidence for relational match enhancements bilaterally in the hippocampus that were selective for matches between the probe stimulus and goal state, but were not modulated by whether that goal was perceptually novel. Moreover, we found evidence for a complementary hippocampal mismatch enhancement that was triggered by stimuli containing salient perceptual manipulations. Our results provided evidence for parallel memory signatures in the hippocampus: a controlled match signal that can detect matches to internally generated goal states and an automatic mismatch signal that can identify unpredicted perceptual novelty.The formation and retrieval of relational memories critically depends on the hippocampus, as demonstrated by numerous lesion, electrophysiological, and human imaging studies (for review, see Squire et al., 2004; Davachi, 2006; Eichenbaum et al., 2007; Mayes et al., 2007). Nonetheless, how it performs these operations remains poorly understood. Strictly in terms of neuronal firing rate, previously encoded events can be distinguished from novel ones by increased activity for events that match stored representations (i.e., match enhancement), or by greater activity for novel events (i.e., mismatch enhancement). Electrophysiological studies provide evidence for both of these signals within the hippocampus (Freid et al., 1997; Wood et al., 1999; Rutishauser et al., 2006), although neither the distinction between these seemingly redundant signals nor the nature of the representations against which these comparisons are being made are known.An intriguing clue comes from previous dissociations of memory signatures for item information in the monkey perirhinal cortex (Miller and Desimone, 1994). In a standard sequential delayed match-to-sample task, which can be performed by detecting any repetition, mismatch enhancement predominated in the perirhinal cortex (see Fig. 1 legend for a more detailed explanation of how we use the terms \u201cmatch enhancements\u201d and \u201cmismatch enhancements\u201d). However, in an altered paradigm in which behaviorally irrelevant repetitions intervened between sample and target, requiring active maintenance of a goal, distinct neuronal populations expressing match and mismatch enhancements were found. Interestingly, match neurons signaled the repetition of the goal image, whereas mismatch neurons were not modulated by behavioral relevance.Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have reported relational mismatch enhancement in the human hippocampus (Kumaran and Maguire, 2006, 2007a). Specifically, the hippocampus displayed the greatest response during sequences of objects that relationally differed from the expectations developed by the previous sequence. A complementary match enhancement may not have been found, however, because participants in these studies performed one-back tasks that were unrelated to the experimental manipulation. If match enhancements convey behaviorally relevant matches, then these signals would only be uncovered in experiments designed to investigate goal relevant matches.Consistent with this hypothesis, Hannula and Ranganath (2008) found enhanced hippocampal activation for images that matched a maintained goal. In this task, participants mentally rotated arrangements of objects and identified probes that matched this perceptually novel, generated goal. Although finding match enhancements in response to perceptually novel stimuli suggests that internally generated representations may be used in goal-match calculations, it is still possible that a combination of perceptual-mismatch and goal-match signals are driving the enhancement seen. In other words, goal-matches were present in conditions that always contained perceptual-mismatches.We developed a paradigm that fully crosses whether stimuli match or mismatch a goal state or a previous perception to help elucidate the mechanisms underlying match and mismatch enhancements in the human hippocampus. We predict that hippocampal match enhancements will reflect goal-matches rather than perceptual-matches, whereas mismatch enhancements may be influenced by perceptual novelty.Eighteen (six females) right-handed native English speakers with normal or corrected-to-normal vision participated in the study. Their mean age was 21 with a range of 18\u201327. Consent was obtained in a manner approved by the Institutional Review Board at New York University.Participants performed two working memory tasks (object-match and object-switch). Both began with participants viewing a sample image (a room containing a pair of objects), maintaining information over a variable delay, and then making a memory decision on a probe image. In the object-match task, participants were instructed to respond \u201cyes\u201d only to a probe that was identical to the sample stimulus, whereas in the object-switch task, participants were instructed to swap the locations of the objects and respond \u201cyes\u201d only to this perceptually novel goal.Across the two tasks, six experimental conditions were developed (Fig. 1). In the object-match task, if the probe contained the same objects as the sample image in their original locations, the probe would match both the goal and previous perceptual experience (BOTH), and if it contained the same objects in the reversed locations, it would match neither the goal state nor the perceptual experience (NEITHER). In the object-switch task, if the probe was identical to the sample, then it matched the previous perception while mismatching the goal (PERCEPT), and if it contained the same objects in the reverse locations, then the probe matched the goal but mismatched the percept (GOAL). In both tasks, a probe stimulus could contain a new object (OBJ) or an old object in a new location (LOC) with respect to the sample image. Subjects should respond negatively to these probe conditions. All subjects were presented with an equal number of trials of each condition.Experimental conditions and predicted patterns of activation. , A schematic illustration of the two working memory tasks. The first three columns illustrate the events of a trial and the four possible probe images. Both tasks begin with the presentation of a sample followed by a delay period, and finally participants make their memory decision during the probe presentation. In the object-match task, subjects are instructed to respond \u201cyes\u201d to probes that contain the same objects in their original locations, whereas in the object-switch task, probes that contain the same objects in the reversed locations receive a \u201cyes\u201d response. The last two columns label the trial types contained in the object-match and object-switch tasks along with their required responses. See Materials and Methods, Behavioral procedures, for a more detailed explanation of the trial types. , Predictions for distinctive patterns of activation that would be consistent with four types of memory signals. Goal-match enhancement refers to the pattern of activity that would be consistent with a region that is sensitive to goal-matches. Greater activity would be found in response to trials that match the participants' goal state (BOTH and GOAL) compared with trials that mismatch the goal (NEITHER and PERCEPT). The perceptual-match enhancement pattern would be consistent with a region sensitive to perceptual-matches. Greater activity would be elicited by probes that are identical to the sample stimulus (BOTH and PERCEPT) compared with perceptually novel probes (NEITHER and GOAL). The goal-mismatch enhancement would be consistent with a region sensitive to goal-mismatches with stimuli that mismatch the goal state (NEITHER and PERCEPT) eliciting greater activity than stimuli that match it (BOTH and GOAL). The perceptual-mismatch pattern would be consistent with a region that is responsive to perceptual-mismatches with perceptually novel stimuli (NEITHER and GOAL) eliciting greater activity than stimuli that are identical to the sample (BOTH and PERCEPT). It should be noted that these signals are defined by the difference in response across conditions. Although we adopt a terminology that is consistent with an underlying enhancement mechanism, each pattern could also be explained with a suppression mechanism. For example, the goal-match enhancement pattern could be also called a goal-mismatch suppression.All stimuli were generated from a set of 138 two-color rooms (12 reserved for training) and 299 color drawings of objects (26 reserved for training). The room stimuli were rendered in Adobe Illustrator with a common spatial layout, but unique in the combination of colors and patterns of stripes or checkerboards used on the floor and walls. Two hundred sixty of the object images were from a colorized Snodgrass image database (Rossion and Pourtois, 2004); the remainder (26 training and 13 test) were selected from web-based clip art collections with the criteria that they did not have the same names as any objects in the original set and had a similar style of rendering. Each scene stimulus was composed of one room with two overlaid objects, each positioned in one of nine locations defined by an invisible 3 \u00d7 3 grid on the floor of the room. All scenes were generated during the experiment or training sessions using the psychophysics toolbox (version PTB-3) (Brainard, 1997) for Matlab (MathWorks).Twenty-one arrangements of objects were used in the study. They were selected to ensure that no object was obscured by the other and that each location was filled a similar number of times. For every subject, each of the 21 arrangements was used in each of the six conditions. In the new location condition, one of the objects was moved to an adjacent grid location in either the  or  directions with approximately equal frequency. The objects were broken into 13 groups of 21 objects (plus the 26 reserved for the training trials). Over the subjects, each group of objects had approximately an equal likelihood of occurring in each of the six conditions. Each object was used as the new object in the new object condition and as old objects in all conditions across subjects.Subjects performed the object-match and object-switch working memory tasks while in the scanner. Both tasks began with the presentation of a sample stimulus (3 s duration) with an auditory task cue played during the last 0.5 s of the presentation. A variable delay period (7, 9, 11 s) followed, and each trial ended with a probe stimulus presentation for 2 s. Subjects were able to make their response on a button box only during this 2 s period. A variable intertrial interval (8, 10, 12 s), during which subjects viewed a blank screen, separated trials.In the object-match task (cued with the sound of a chime), subjects were instructed to make a \u201cyes\u201d response only when the probe stimulus contained the same objects in the same locations as the sample and a \u201cno\u201d response in all other cases. In the object-switch task (cued with the sound of a buzzer), subjects were instructed to make a \u201cyes\u201d response when the probe contained the same objects as the sample stimulus but in the reversed locations (i.e., object 1 was in the location formally occupied by object 2 and vice versa). There were four possible probe scenes: the same objects in the original locations (BOTH in the object-match task and PERCEPT in the object-switch task); the same objects in the reversed locations (NEITHER in the object-match task and GOAL in the object-switch task); the same objects with one moved to a new location (LOC); and the same locations with one new object (OBJ).Subjects were trained on the two tasks before entering the scanner. They first received written instructions outlining how to perform the object-match and object-switch tasks. They were instructed to respond \u201cyes\u201d by pressing a key with their index finger and to respond \u201cno\u201d by pressing their middle finger key. They were warned that some probes would contain new objects or old objects in new locations and that they would need to attend to both the object identity and location to perform the task. Next, they performed a training session to ensure they understood the requirements of each condition and were able to make their response in the allotted time.The experimental task was presented over three separate runs. Each run had 42 trials, seven of each condition. The order of trial types was determined by the \u201cOptseq2\u201d algorithm (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/optseq/) to provide the best sequence for subsequent estimation of condition-specific effects.All scanning was performed using a 3T Siemens Allegra MRI system with a whole-head coil. Functional data were collected using a gradient-echo planar pulse (EPI) sequence (repetition time, 2000 ms; echo time, 30 ms; field of view, 192; 36 slices aligned perpendicular to the hippocampal long axis; 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm voxel size; three runs; 505 volumes per run). A T1-weighted, high-resolution sequence (magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo; 176 sagittal slices, 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm voxels) was run to collect anatomical data after the completion of the final experimental run. Visual stimuli were projected onto a screen that was viewed through a mirror attached to the subject's head coil. Auditory stimuli were presented through a Siemens headphone system. Before the first experimental run, the subjects adjusted the volume of the auditory cues over the noise of the same EPI sequence used for the collection of functional data. During the same EPI sequence, they then performed a brief auditory discrimination task to insure that they could easily tell the cues apart over the noise of the scanner.The imaging data were analyzed using SPM2 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, London, UK). During preprocessing, the functional data were corrected for differences in slice acquisition timing and then motion was corrected across runs. Subjects who moved >3 mm in any direction would have been removed from analysis, but all subjects' movement estimates were below this criterion. The functional data were then spatially normalized to an EPI template in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. The transformation obtained from this normalization was used to normalize the anatomical data. Finally, the voxels were spatially smoothed with a 6 mm full-width at half-maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel.Functional data were analyzed using a general linear model implemented in SPM2. An impulse response at the onset of the sample stimulus and probe presentation was used to model the activity during these events. A box car of appropriate length (7, 9, or 11 s) was used to model the intervening delay period activity. The two tasks, object- match and object-switch, were modeled separately during the delay period, the six possible probe conditions were modeled separately, and all sample presentations were modeled together. Additionally, the sample, delay, and probe periods of error trials were modeled separately from those of successful trials. Because performance was very high in both tasks, error trials were not included in any subsequent analysis. The three runs were concatenated and modeled as one to increase the number of trials used to estimate each parameter. Each regressor was convolved with both a canonical hemodynamic response function and its temporal derivative, resulting in two regressors per event. The mean signal and linear drift were separately modeled for each run as confounds. Subject-specific fixed-effects models were used to estimate effects of task and probe conditions. These subject-specific contrasts were entered into a random-effects analysis (one-sample  test) for group analysis. To investigate effects in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), an adjusted reliability threshold of  < 0.005 (five contiguous voxels) was adopted to accommodate the relatively low signal-to-noise ratio within the MTL (Ojemann et al., 1997; Schacter and Wagner, 1999; Davachi and Wagner, 2002; Strange et al., 2002; Dobbins et al., 2003; Weis et al., 2004; Mitchell et al., 2004; O'Kane et al., 2005). Regions outside of the MTL were considered reliable at a  < 0.001 level (five contiguous voxels). All subsequent comparisons were preformed on subject-specific \u03b2 estimates for each condition across all voxels contained in clusters identified by the random-effects analysis.The experiment was designed so that different types of memory signatures can be distinguished by the patterns of activation triggered by all of the probe conditions (see Fig. 1 for predicted patterns of activation). A region with activity that is consistent with a match enhancement should exhibit greater activation during BOTH compared with NEITHER probe stimuli. Importantly, however, goal-match and percept-match enhancements can be distinguished by the response to probe types in the object-switch task. Specifically, if there is more activation in the GOAL condition, the match enhancement is likely driven by a match between the probe and the goal; if there is more activation in the PERCEPT, the signal is more likely driven by a match to the previous percept. This same logic holds for mismatch enhancements defined by greater activation during the NEITHER than the BOTH condition. Greater activation during the PERCEPT than GOAL trials would be consistent with a goal-mismatch enhancement, whereas a percept-mismatch enhancement would be inferred when activity is greater in the GOAL than the PERCEPT condition. Hence, consideration of activation across all four experimental conditions will yield a greater understanding of what representations are driving either response.It should be noted that we are not able to conclusively determine whether an observed pattern is being driven by an enhancement or suppression of neural firing. For example, the pattern that we refer to as a goal-match enhancement (Fig. 1) could be driven by an increased response to probes that match a goal state or, rather, a suppressed response to probes that mismatch a goal. Thus, we could have referred to this pattern as a goal-mismatch suppression. We have chosen to adopt terms here that are consistent with enhancement, and they will be used throughout this report to refer to the four patterns in Figure 1.Regions showing the predicted pattern of activation across the four relational conditions (BOTH, NEITHER, GOAL, and PERCEPT) were identified by looking at the conjunctions of within-task contrasts of probe regressors. We entered the results of targeted group random-effects contrasts into each conjunction analysis to identify voxels that show a combination of effects. Regions showing a goal-match enhancement were identified by the conjunction of the BOTH > NEITHER and GOAL > PERCEPT contrasts. Regions showing a goal-mismatch enhancement were identified by the conjunction of the contrasts of NEITHER > BOTH and PERCEPT > GOAL. Regions showing a perceptual-match enhancement with the conjunction of BOTH > NEITHER and PERCEPT > GOAL and perceptual-mismatch enhancements were identified with the conjunction of NEITHER > BOTH and GOAL > PERCEPT contrasts. Similarly, second-level analyses were used to investigate identified regions of interest using a 2 \u00d7 2 within-subjects ANOVA (goal: match vs mismatch; percept: match vs mismatch) so that a main effect for goal where match > mismatch would indicate that the selected region shows goal-match enhancement. Critically, paired  tests were used to verify that the expected conditions did indeed differ from each other.A conjunction analysis was also performed to identify regions that were preferentially responsive to conditions with both types of salient perceptual novelty (OBJ and LOC). This novelty-conjunction analysis consisted of the conjunction of LOC > (BOTH and NEITHER and GOAL and PERCEPT) and OBJ > (BOTH and NEITHER and GOAL and PERCEPT).Regions in the MTL were considered reliable in a conjunction analysis at a combined  < 0.005 level, and regions outside the MTL were considered reliable at a combined  < 0.001 level.See Table 1 for the mean accuracy and reaction times for correct trials in each condition. Paired sample  tests revealed that responses in the object-match task were faster than those in the object-switch task ((17) = 4.0;  < 0.001) and that responses to probes that matched the goal (\u201cyes\u201d responses) were faster than those that mismatched this representation (\u201cno\u201d responses; (17) = 5.7;  < 0.001). Hence, greater activation for goal-matches, compared with mismatches, is not simply driven by time on task. The accuracy measure did not show these effects. Instead, trials in which the probe stimulus was a perceptual-match to the sample (BOTH and PERCEPT trials) had greater accuracy than conditions in which the probe contained reversed objects (NEITHER and GOAL trials), (17) = 3.3;  < 0.005. Critically, we only used correct trials in all functional imaging analyses.Behavioral performanceThe global pattern of activation elicited by the task was first assessed with contrasts of the sample period > baseline (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) and the probe period (collapsed across conditions) > baseline (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Both of these periods were associated with robust activity throughout the ventral visual pathway, MTL regions including bilateral hippocampus and perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices, as well as the frontal cortex, basil ganglia, thalamus, and parietal cortex.The crucial comparisons in this design, however, are based on the patterns of activation seen across conditions during the probe period. To determine this, four conjunction analyses were completed to reveal regions that exhibited activation patterns consistent with match and mismatch enhancements selective for goal or perceptual information. Critically, we predicted that if regions in the hippocampus express match enhancements driven by matches to goal states and not perceptual novelty, then activity would be greater for BOTH compared with NEITHER trials in the object-match task and for GOAL compared with PERCEPT trials in the object-switch task. This should be the case even though the probe on GOAL trials has never been seen before.Of the four match/mismatch conjunction analyses, only the goal-match pattern (BOTH > NEITHER and GOAL > PERCEPT) yielded voxels within the MTL. This was true even when the combined threshold was reduced to a very liberal threshold of  < 0.01. In particular, bilateral posterior hippocampal regions (extending into parahippocampal cortex on the right) were found to exhibit a goal-match pattern of response. Critically, when the condition-specific \u03b2 estimates were examined in these regions, the benefit for trials that matched the goal state over those that mismatched was comparable across both encoding tasks (Fig. 2). Because the goals in each task differed in perceptual novelty, this comparable benefit implies that the match calculation is not affected by whether the goal was perceived or had to be internally generated. It should be noted, however, that BOTH and GOAL activations are not significantly greater than the activations for OBJ or LOC trials (all  > 0.1; with the exception of GOAL being greater than OBJ in the right hippocampal/parahippocampal region; (17) = 2.4;  < 0.05). BOTH and GOAL conditions would be expected to have the greatest activation in voxels that are solely devoted to goal-match calculations. Instead, in the right hippocampal/parahippocampal region, LOC activations are significantly greater than NEITHER activations ((34) = 2.34;  < 0.05). OBJ and LOC responses were not significantly different from any other conditions (all  > 0.1). The heightened response for conditions with salient perceptual novelty suggests that a weak mismatch enhancement may be occurring alongside the match calculations made in these regions, but, as noted above, the match calculation itself does not seem to be modulated by the perceptual novelty of the goal image.Regions in bilateral posterior hippocampi that were revealed in the goal-match conjunction analysis (BOTH > NEITHER and GOAL > PERCEPT).

Voxels in this same area isolated with a probe period (collapsed across stimulus types) > baseline contrast showed a similar, but marginally significant, goal-match trend ((1,34) = 3.0;  = 0.09). Finally, voxels in the right anterior hippocampus that were activated by the probe (compared with baseline) also displayed this same goal-match pattern of activation ((1,34) = 5.2;  < 0.05). The finding of goal-match enhancements in hippocampal voxels that were selected only by their activation during the task reinforces the interpretation that goal-match enhancements were the predominant mnemonic signals elicited in the hippocampus by this paradigm.A small region in the left posterior hippocampus (MNI coordinates: \u221227, \u221224, \u22129) was revealed by a GOAL > PERCEPT contrast, but it did not show a benefit for goal-matches (BOTH > NEITHER) in the object-match task ( < 1). If the benefit for GOAL trials reflected a general preference for perceptual-mismatches or goal-matches (as is seen in the two posterior hippocampal regions), then some selectivity for either NEITHER or BOTH trials, respectively, would be expected. The pattern in this region, however, is more consistent with an area that has a preference for a combination of goal-matches and perceptual-mismatches, consistent with associative match-mismatch detection (Kumaran and Maguire, 2007b). Interestingly, although it is found in the left instead of right hemisphere, this region is similarly located along the anteroposterior axis to a region (MNI coordinates: 27, \u221227, \u22126) found by Kumaran and Maguire (2007a).Although no regions within the MTL were found to show mismatch enhancements in response to goal-mismatches or subtle perceptual-mismatches, regions in the MTL were found to show preferential activity for the more salient perceptually novel OBJ and LOC conditions. The novelty-conjunction analysis revealed regions in the posterior right hippocampus (Fig. 3), left parahippocampal cortex, right perirhinal cortex, and right amygdala. Interestingly, the hippocampal region does display a pattern consistent with a goal-match enhancement, but this was not found to be significant ((1,34) = 2.4;  > 0.1). Moreover, within each task, BOTH activation was not significantly greater than NEITHER, and GOAL activation was not significantly greater than PERCEPT (both  > 0.1). Additionally, a large region in the anterior hippocampus was also found to have preferential activity for the novel OBJ condition, as revealed by an OBJ > (BOTH and NEITHER and GOAL and PERCEPT) contrast (Fig. 3). In this region, the responses to BOTH, NEITHER, GOAL, and PERCEPT conditions were also not significantly different from each other (all  > 0.1).Regions in the right (R.) hippocampus that displayed activation patterns consistent with a mismatch enhancement.

Accompanying bar graphs display the mean \u03b2 estimates across subjects for each of the probe types averaged across the voxels contained in the highlighted cluster. * < 0.05. , A right posterior hippocampal region (MNI coordinates:  = 23,  = \u221235,  = \u22122) that was revealed in the novelty conjunction analysis ([LOC > BOTH and NEITHER and GOAL and PERCEPT] and [OBJ > BOTH and NEITHER and GOAL and PERCEPT]). This pattern of activity is consistent with a region that responds to salient perceptual novelty, whether it be new objects or new locations. , A right anterior hippocampal region (extending into entorhinal cortex; MNI coordinates:  = 20,  = \u22128,  = \u221224) that was revealed in a contrast of OBJ > BOTH and NEITHER and GOAL and PERCEPT. t-stat, -statistic.Conjunction analysis resultsA region in the posterior left hippocampus (MNI coordinates: \u221232, \u221231, \u22128) showed sustained delay period activity regardless of trial type as determined by an object-match delay and object-switch delay > baseline contrast.  tests confirmed that both the object-match and object-switch delay periods were significantly greater than baseline (both  < 0.05) and not different from each other ( < 1). It is worth noting that this region overlaps with the left hippocampal goal-match region. When the \u03b2 estimates for the probe were extracted from this delay region, a goal-match pattern was also observed ((1,34) = 10.2;  < 0.005) (Fig. 4). See supplemental Figure 1 (available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) for cortical regions revealed by this contrast.A region in the left (L.) posterior hippocampus revealed by a delay period (collapsed across object-match and object-switch trials) > baseline contrast. This region (MNI coordinates:  = \u221232,  = \u221231,  = \u22128) overlaps with the left hippocampal region revealed by the goal-match conjunction analysis and also displays a goal-match pattern of activity during the probe. , Parameter map (-map) of this contrast overlaid on coronal slices of a representative subject's T1-weighted image. t-stat, -statistic. , \u03b2 Estimates from the cluster highlighted in  for each stimulus type during the probe period. The voxels in this region also show a significant goal-match effect ((1,34) = 10.2;  < 0.005).Additional regions in MTL and prefrontal cortex were revealed in a contrast of object-switch delay > object-match delay. A region in the right posterior hippocampus (MNI coordinates: 29, \u221220, \u221211) and left amygdala (\u221229, \u221210, \u221221) both displayed this pattern, along with medial prefrontal (\u22123, 14, 49) and anterior cingulate cortex (3, 24, 33). Bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (MNI coordinates: 36, 39, 39; \u221242, 48, 15) was also revealed in this contrast, consistent with its proposed role in the manipulation of information during working memory tasks (Owen et al., 1996; D'esposito et al., 1999; Postle et al., 1999; Ranganath, 2006; Blumenfeld and Ranganath, 2006).Although there is some evidence for match enhancement in the perirhinal cortex (Miller and Desimone, 1994), activation patterns in the human perirhinal cortex are more commonly consistent with mismatch enhancement (Henson et al., 2003; Brozinsky et al., 2005; Gonsalves et al., 2005; K\u00f6hler et al., 2005; Danckert et al., 2007). For example, a recent study that compared hippocampal and perirhinal responses to stimuli over multiple repetitions demonstrated that although the hippocampus can express enhanced responses to repeated stimuli, the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices show their greatest response to the first presentation of a stimulus (Preston and Gabrieli, 2008).In the current study, however, we were able to find evidence for both match and mismatch enhancement in the perirhinal cortex. A region in the right perirhinal cortex, extending laterally into the fusiform gyrus (MNI coordinates: 38, \u221210, \u221235), was revealed in the goal-match conjunction analysis. Another region in the right perirhinal cortex (MNI coordinates: 36, \u221221, \u221227) was identified in the novelty conjunction that reveals regions that are sensitive to salient perceptual manipulations. When the different probe responses were examined in perirhinal voxels that were significantly activated by the cue (greater than baseline at a  < 0.005 level), the activation to the OBJ condition, which elicited the strongest response, was significantly greater than the activation related to the PERCEPT condition, which elicited the weakest response ((17) = 2.9,  < 0.05 in the left hemisphere and (17) = 4.0,  < 0.001 in the right hemisphere). No other condition comparisons were significant in these voxels. Left perirhinal voxels activated by the probe (all probe conditions greater than baseline at a  < 0.005 level) had a similar pattern with the OBJ response being significantly greater than the PERCEPT response ((17) = 2.2;  < 0.05). Together, these results provide evidence for a goal-match enhancement in the human perirhinal cortex but also suggest that, unlike the hippocampus, the global pattern of activation in the perirhinal cortex is biased toward responses to novel objects and is suppressed for repeated presentations of images, consistent with the repetition suppression literature.The calculation of matches/mismatches between the environment and expectation has been proposed to mediate the switching between encoding and retrieval modes in the hippocampus (Hasselmo and Schnell, 1994; Hasselmo et al., 1995; Lorincz and Buzsaki, 2000; Lisman and Otmakhova, 2001; Vinogradova, 2001; Meeter et al., 2004; Lisman and Grace, 2005; Kumaran and Maguire, 2007b). According to these accounts, encoding and retrieval biases must be established in the hippocampus because uncontrolled co-occurrence of these processes would result in the overwriting of memories and the formation of excessively overlapping traces.Although these theoretically important match and mismatch signals have been reported before, to our knowledge, this is the first experiment, using either functional imaging or electrophysiological techniques, to modulate intentional and perceptual states to systematically examine relational match and mismatch enhancements in the hippocampus. To accomplish this, the present paradigm decoupled whether a probe stimulus matched the actively maintained goal or the previous perceptual experience. Thus, regions could be identified that exhibit match or mismatch enhancements selective for each type of representation. Based on previous electrophysiological research (Miller and Desimone, 1994; Suzuki et al., 1997), we predicted that goal states would drive match enhancements, whereas perceptual experience would influence mismatch enhancements.Goal-match enhancements were found in bilateral posterior hippocampi, extending into right parahippocampal cortex. Critically, the benefit seen for stimuli matching the goal state was similar across tasks even though these stimuli differed in their perceptual novelty, suggesting that these match calculations were not influenced by whether the goal image was perceived or had to be internally generated. The finding that match enhancements are goal dependent provides a framework for synthesizing apparently discordant findings of match versus mismatch enhancements in the hippocampus (Kumaran and Maguire, 2006, 2007a; Hannula and Ranganath, 2008); the analyses in the studies by Kumaran and Maguire (2006, 2007a) were not sensitive to goal-match enhancements because the participants' goal (i.e., one-back task) was orthogonal to the experimental manipulations. Moreover, our finding that match enhancements can operate on internally generated goals also supports the interpretation of Hannula and Ranganath (2008) that it was the match-to-goal states that drove the enhanced hippocampal response to perceptually novel target trials.The reversal of memory signals seen in two recent high-resolution imaging studies (Kirwan and Stark, 2007; Bakker et al., 2008) further supports the selectivity of match enhancements for goal information. In both experiments, participants were presented with a series of images that contained exact repetitions, manipulated repetitions, and novel images, but the task performed by the subjects differed. When instructed to perform a continuous recognition task in which repetitions had to be distinguished from similar lures, match enhancements predominated in the hippocampus (Kirwan and Stark, 2007). In the second study, participants passively viewed the stimuli (Bakker et al., 2008). Under these instructions, a mismatch enhancement was seen throughout the subfields of the hippocampus. Although not discussed within our proposed framework, these previous results are consistent with our findings that, whereas both match and mismatch enhancements co-occur within the hippocampus, match enhancements are responses to goal-matches.Evidence for the more commonly observed mismatch enhancements (Ranganath and Rainer, 2003; K\u00f6hler et al., 2005; Kumaran and Maguire, 2006, 2007a) was also obtained in the current study. Whereas a perceptually driven mismatch enhancement was not revealed in the conjunctive contrast of NEITHER > BOTH and GOAL > PERCEPT, a hippocampal mismatch enhancement was seen in conditions in which a novel, unexpected object occurred and/or when an old object occurred in a new location. It is likely that these activations reflect the detection and subsequent encoding of these unpredictable and salient events. It should be noted that a hippocampal region showing a mismatch response also displayed a pattern consistent with a goal-match enhancement, although this did not reach significance. This raises the important question of the spatial independence of these signals and suggests that neurons expressing these signals may be intermixed.A region similar in location to the hippocampal novel object area described above was found in a recent study that modulated attention to novelty (Dudukovic and Wagner, 2007). In that experiment, participants were presented with two previously studied words and one novel word and were asked to either perform a recency judgment or select the novel word. A contrast of novelty task > recency task revealed an anterior hippocampal region. Because the stimuli were identical in both tasks, this contrast does not reveal regions that have preferential firing for novel items, but instead for attention to novelty. This signal may also have been related to the successful encoding of novel stimuli because a follow-up behavioral study indicated that the novel words in the novelty task were better remembered during a subsequent recognition task than novel items in the recency task.There remain other possible causes of the match and mismatch enhancements seen here. The trial structure of this experiment resulted in fewer probes containing novel objects and locations than other probe types. On any given trial, participants had a one-in-three chance of seeing a probe that was identical to the sample (BOTH and PERCEPT trials), a one-in-three chance of seeing a probe with objects in reversed locations (NEITHER and GOAL trials), a one-in-six chance of seeing a novel object, and a one-in-six chance of seeing a novel location. It is possible, therefore, that the mismatch response was not driven solely by the saliency of the perceptual manipulation but also by the breaking of expectations, similar to the interpretation given by Kumaran and Maguire (2006). Furthermore, to maintain an equal number of trials in each condition and maximize the power in this design, it was necessary to have fewer \u201cyes\u201d responses than \u201cno\u201d responses. It is possible that part of the observed match enhancement was driven by a mismatch in response expectation. However, there are several reasons why we think this is unlikely. In a preliminary behavioral pilot experiment, participants generally reported that they were not aware of any differences between the frequency of making \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d responses, although processes occurring outside of conscious awareness could drive a response mismatch enhancement. If this were the case, we might expect to see some effect on response times, which could result in the less frequent \u201cyes\u201d responses being slower than \u201cno\u201d responses, but, in fact, the opposite pattern was found. Of course, the possibility remains that the effect of response bias on response times was overshadowed by the relative ease of making \u201cyes\u201d responses. As a more direct test, we conducted a  analysis by separately extracting time courses from the hippocampal match regions during the first and third runs. It was reasoned that, if the benefit for trials that match the goal state were driven by the novelty of the \u201cyes\u201d response, then this benefit would be larger during the final run when response probabilities were well established. We found that the difference between the response to trials that matched the goal state and those that mismatched it was actually stronger during the first run than the third (see supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), again providing evidence that it is the match between the active goal state and the probe that is driving the effect.The possibility that active maintenance of goals contributes to match calculations is supported by sustained delay period activation seen in the hippocampus during both tasks. Interestingly, the region that shows a delay period response also displayed a goal-match activation pattern during the probe presentation. Additionally, this region overlapped with the left hippocampal area revealed in the goal-match analysis. This overlap suggests that the mechanism underlying goal-match enhancement may be a reactivation, through perceptual input, of the already excited delay active neurons. Together, these results suggest that active maintenance of a goal is supported, at least in part, by sustained hippocampal neuronal firing and that, at probe presentation, a comparison is made between the maintained goal and the perceptual probe. Our data show that this comparison is reflected in two distinct memory signatures. First, when the probe matches the internally maintained goal, there is an enhancement in hippocampal activation, perhaps resulting from an enhancement in the firing of the very same neurons used to maintain the goal throughout the delay. Second, when a probe contains a novel element, enhanced activation may reflect attention to or encoding of novel elements.The dissociation between match and mismatch signals by their sensitivity to top-down intentional information and bottom-up perceptual information intuitively fits the role of a memory system. Although it would be inefficient to continually monitor matches between expectations and the environment, calculating matches to goals that are being actively maintained is a necessary step toward achieving those goals. Similarly, significant novel events need to be identified by an automatic memory decision based on perceptual information to allow for quick orienting toward unpredicted events.This work was supported by National Institute of Mental Health Grant MH074692.Thank you for sharing this Journal of Neuroscience article.NOTE: We request your email address only to inform the recipient that it was you who recommended this article, and that it is not junk mail.

In response to a brain injury, astrocytes proliferate and become hypertrophic with an increased expression of intermediate filament proteins. This process is collectively referred to as reactive astrocytosis. Lipocalin 2 (lcn2) is a member of the lipocalin family that binds to small hydrophobic molecules. We propose that lcn2 is an autocrine mediator of reactive astrocytosis based on the multiple roles of lcn2 in the regulation of cell death, morphology, and migration of astrocytes. lcn2 expression and secretion increased after inflammatory stimulation in cultured astrocytes. Forced expression of lcn2 or treatment with LCN2 protein increased the sensitivity of astrocytes to cytotoxic stimuli. Iron and BIM (Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death) proteins were involved in the cytotoxic sensitization process. LCN2 protein induced upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), cell migration, and morphological changes similar to characteristic phenotypic changes termed reactive astrocytosis. The lcn2-induced phenotypic changes of astrocytes occurred through a Rho\u2013ROCK (Rho kinase)\u2013GFAP pathway, which was positively regulated by nitric oxide and cGMP. In zebrafishes, forced expression of rat lcn2 gene increased the number and thickness of cellular processes in GFAP-expressing radial glia cells, suggesting that lcn2 expression in glia cells plays an important role . Our results suggest that lcn2 acts in an autocrine manner to induce cell death sensitization and morphological changes in astrocytes under inflammatory conditions and that these phenotypic changes may be the basis of reactive astrocytosis .Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cell type in the brain (Aschner, 1998; Barres and Barde, 2000). Astrocytes provide metabolic and trophic support to neurons and modulate synaptic activity. They are also the main responders to CNS aggravations under various pathological conditions such as injury, ischemia, infection, and neurodegeneration (Farina et al., 2007). In response to all types of CNS insults, astrocytes become reactive and undergo a process termed reactive astrocytosis (Pekny and Nilsson, 2005; Sofroniew, 2005; Correa-Cerro and Mandell, 2007). In this process, astrocytes proliferate to fill gaps and undergo a typical morphological change: a large cytoplasmic mass, long and branched processes, and increased expression of intermediate filaments such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Although the basic process of reactive astrocytosis is evolutionarily conserved and accompanies all forms of neural injuries, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the reactive astrocytosis processes are presently far from clear.Recent evidence indicated that inflammatory cells in the CNS may undergo apoptosis on activation in a manner similar to activation-induced cell death of lymphocytes (Mabuchi et al., 2000; P. Lee et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2001; Suk et al., 2001; Falsig et al., 2004; Suk, 2005). Microglia as well as astrocytes have been shown to undergo apoptosis on a strong inflammatory activation (Hu and Van Eldik, 1996; Ferrari et al., 1997; Kingham and Pocock, 2000; J. Lee et al., 2001; Suk et al., 2002; Takuma et al., 2004). It has been proposed that apoptosis of glia cells after massive proliferation may be a means of population control (Jones et al., 1997). However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the autoregulatory apoptosis of glia and the termination of neuroinflammation.Lipocalin 2 (lcn2) is a member of the lipocalin family, which binds or transports lipid and other hydrophobic molecules (Flower et al., 2000; Kjeldsen et al., 2000). lcn2 is also known as 24p3 and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) (Borregaard and Cowland, 2006).  studies have shown that lcn2 is important for both cellular apoptosis and survival (Devireddy et al., 2001, 2005; Yousefi and Simon, 2002; Tong et al., 2003, 2005; Nelson et al., 2008). It also plays an important role in the induction of cellular differentiation in kidney during embryogenesis (Yang et al., 2002) and protects the kidney from ischemic injury (Mishra et al., 2004; Mori et al., 2005). lcn2 has been proposed as the real-time indicator of active kidney damage (Mori and Nakao, 2007). lcn2-deficient mice exhibited an increased susceptibility to  infection because of the failure of iron sequestration, indicating a critical role of lcn2 in the protection against bacterial infection (Flo et al., 2004). lcn2 may function as an acute-phase protein (Liu and Nilsen-Hamilton, 1995) and an adipokine involved in insulin resistance (Yan et al., 2007). Recently, two cellular receptors for lcn2 have been identified, megalin (Hvidberg et al., 2005) and brain type organic cation transporter (Devireddy et al., 2005). However, the precise role of lcn2 in the cell survival and death has yet to be determined.In the present study, we investigated the role of lcn2 in both functional and structural changes of reactive astrocytes. Our results indicated that lcn2 is critical for cell death sensitization, stimulation of cell migration, and morphological changes of reactive astrocytes. Additional studies showed that iron metabolism and Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death (BIM) protein are involved in the lcn2-induced cytotoxic sensitization and that Rho\u2013Rho kinase (ROCK) pathway with a positive amplification via nitric oxide/cGMP is involved in the lcn2-mediated morphological changes of reactive astrocytes. Last, the expression of lcn2 in glia cells and the role of lcn2 in the phenotypic changes similar to reactive astrocytosis were confirmed  using a zebrafish model.The following chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich: lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from  0111:B4 prepared by phenolic extraction and gel filtration chromatography, sodium nitroprusside dihydrate (SNP), -nitroso--acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), paraquat dichloride, ganglioside mixture, H2O2, G-monomethyl-l-arginine (NMMA), forskolin, dibutyryl cyclic GMP (dbcGMP), deferoxamine mesylate, ferric citrate, and polymyxin B. A ROCK inhibitor ()-(+)--(4-pyridyl)-4-(1-aminoethyl)-cyclohexanecarboxamide (Y27632) was purchased from Calbiochem. Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and mouse interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) proteins were purchased from R&D Systems. Iron-saturated enterochelin (0.7 kDa) was purchased from EMC Microcollections. All other chemicals, unless stated otherwise, were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. C6 rat glioma cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen), gentamicin (50 \u03bcg/ml). Astrocyte cultures were prepared from the brains of 0- to 3-d-old ICR mice (Samtako) by the method of McCarthy and de Vellis (1980). Briefly, whole brains were dissociated in DMEM, supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded at 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks coated with poly-d-lysine (Falcon; BD Biosciences Discovery Labware). Cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. The culture medium was changed after 5 d  and then every 3 d. Secondary pure cultures of astrocytes were obtained by shaking mixed glial cultures at 250 rpm overnight, and then culture medium was discarded. Astrocytes were dissociated using trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) and then collected by means of centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 min. The cells were resuspended in DMEM with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, seeded at 1 \u00d7 105 cells/ml onto six-well plates coated with poly-d-lysine, and cultured for 4 d. The purity of astrocyte cultures was >96% as determined by GFAP immunocytochemical staining. Animals used in the current research had been acquired and cared for in accordance with the guidelines published in the National Institutes of Health .Cells (5 \u00d7 104 cells in 200 \u03bcl/well) were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with various stimuli for the specific time periods. After treatment, the medium was removed and 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (0.5 mg/ml) was added, followed by incubation at 37\u00b0C for 2 h in a CO2 incubator. After insoluble crystals were completely dissolved in DMSO, absorbance at 570 nm was measured by using a microplate reader (Anthos Labtec Instruments).Cells were treated with stimuli in 96-well plates, and then NO2\u2212 in culture supernatants was measured to assess NO production levels. Fifty microliters of sample aliquots were mixed with 50 \u03bcl of Griess reagent (1% sulfanilamide/0.1% naphthylethylene diamine dihydrochloride/2% phosphoric acid) in 96-well plates and incubated at 25\u00b0C for 10 min. The absorbance at 540 nm was measured with a microplate reader (Anthos Labtec Instruments). NaNO2 was used as the standard to calculate NO2\u2212 concentrations.Immunofluorescence analysis was performed as described previously (Seo et al., 2008). In brief, astrocytes (1 \u00d7 105 cells/well in 24-well plates) were cultured on sterile coverslips in 24-well plates, and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and twice rinsed with PBS. Samples were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS\u2013Tween 20 for 10 min and incubated in PBS containing 3% BSA and a mouse anti-GFAP antibody (1:30 dilution) (Biogenex) or 0.12 \u03bcg/ml TRITC (tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate)-conjugated phalloidin (actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion staining kit; Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents). After two washes in PBS\u2013Tween 20, wells were incubated with 2.5 \u03bcg/ml Hoechst 33342 fluorochrome (Invitrogen) or 0.1 \u03bcg/ml DAPI (4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents), followed by incubation with anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated secondary antibody (BD Biosciences). The samples were mounted and observed by means of fluorescence microscopy (Olympus BX50) or confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510). Microscopic images were processed by using a MetaMorph Imaging System (Molecular Devices). Astrocyte processes were quantified as previously described, but with a slight modification (Wilhelmsson et al., 2004; Bor\u00e1n and Garc\u00eda, 2007). The average process length was based on the longest process for each cell from a minimum of five randomly chosen microscopic fields containing at least 100 cells.Astrocytes (1 \u00d7 105 cells/well in 24-well plates) were detached with trypsin-EDTA, and washed twice with cold PBS. The cells were then resuspended in 250 \u03bcl of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) and incubated with 3 \u03bcl of FITC-conjugated annexin V (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Afterward, cells were gently vortexed and incubated for 15 min at room temperature in darkness. Propidium iodide (PI) (20 \u03bcg/ml) was then added, and flow cytometry was performed within 1 h using FACSAria (BD Biosciences). For the purpose of analyzing cell cycle distribution, cells were suspended in PBS/5 mm EDTA, and fixed by adding 100% ethanol dropwise. RNase A (40 \u03bcg/ml) was added to the resuspended cells, and then incubation was conducted at room temperature for 30 min. Propidium iodide (100 \u03bcg/ml) was added and incubated for 30 min. The percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle was determined by means of flow cytometry by using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences).Total RNA was extracted from either C6 cells or primary astrocyte cultures in six-well plates by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription was performed by using Superscript (Invitrogen) and oligo-dT primer. PCR amplification, using specific primer sets, was performed at a 60\u00b0C annealing temperature for 25 cycles as previously described (Kim et al., 2004). Nucleotide sequences of the primers were based on published cDNA sequences (Table 1). The PCR was performed by using a DNA Engine Tetrad Peltier Thermal Cycler (MJ Research). For the analysis of PCR products, 10 \u03bcl of each PCR was electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel and detected under UV light. \u03b2-Actin was used as an internal control.DNA sequences of the primers used for RT-PCRCells in six-well plates were lysed in triple-detergent lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 0.1% SDS, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein concentration in cell lysates was determined by using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). An equal amount of protein from each sample was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare). The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk and sequentially incubated with primary antibodies [goat polyclonal anti-mouse LCN2 antibody (R&D Systems); rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse LCN2/NGAL antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rat monoclonal anti-BIM antibody (Calbiochem); mouse monoclonal anti-GFAP antibody (Biogenex); monoclonal anti-\u03b1-tubulin clone B-5-1-2 mouse ascites fluid (Sigma-Aldrich)] and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-goat, anti-rabbit, anti-rat, and anti-mouse IgG; GE Healthcare), followed by ECL detection (GE Healthcare). Two kinds of anti-LCN2 antibody were used in this study: goat polyclonal antibody (R&D Systems) was used for the detection of LCN2 protein in mouse astrocytes, and rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used for the detection of LCN2 protein in C6 rat glioma cells and zebrafish. For the purpose of the detection of secreted LCN2 protein in astrocyte cultures, Western blot analysis of culture media was performed. In brief, astrocyte cultures grown in 100 mm culture dishes were washed five times with PBS. Cells were then covered with a minimal volume of culture medium, and treated with stimulating agents at 37\u00b0C. Conditioned media were collected and centrifuged successively at 2000 \u00d7  (5 min) and 15,600 \u00d7  (10 min) to remove nonadherent cells and debris. Samples were then precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and acetone mixture (10% TCA and 10 mm DTT in acetone) at \u221220\u00b0C overnight as previously described (Kim et al., 2007). Precipitated proteins were subjected to the SDS-PAGE and Western blot detection of LCN2.Cells were treated with stimuli in a 100 mm culture dish, washed with cold PBS, and lysed in a lysis buffer [20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)]. Lysates were clarified, protein concentrations were determined, and the GTP-bound Rho in the lysates was measured by the effector pulldown assay using the EZ-Detect Rho activation kit (Pierce). In brief, cell lysates were incubated with the agarose-immobilized glutathione -transferase (GST)-Rhotekin, and the coprecipitates were subjected to anti-Rho Western blot analysis to assess the amount of GTP-bound Rho proteins. The anti-Rho antibody used in this study is known to recognize RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC.Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed by using total RNAs isolated from C6 rat glioma cells. Rat lcn2 cDNA sequences of either sense or antisense orientation were PCR amplified from the pooled cDNAs, using target sequence-specific primers by Gateway cloning (Invitrogen). The sequences of PCR primers used for Gateway cloning were as follows: sense lcn2 forward, 5\u2032-GGGG ACA AGT TTG TAC AAA AAA GCA GGCT CCA CC ATG GGC CTG GGT GTC CTG TGT-3\u2032; sense lcn2 reverse, 5\u2032-GGGG ACC ACT TTG TAC AAG AAA GCT GGG TTG TT GTC AAT GCA TTG GTC GGT-3\u2032; antisense lcn2 forward, 5\u2032-GGGG ACA AGT TTG TAC AAA AAA GCA GGCT CCA CC ATG TCA GTT GTC AAT GCA TTG GTC-3\u2032; antisense lcn2 reverse, 5\u2032-GGGG ACC ACT TTG TAC AAG AAA GCT GGG TTG TT ATG GGC CTG GGT GTC CTG TGT-3\u2032. The forward primers were used to introduce B1 sequence (underlined), followed by a Kozak sequence (CCACC) and the gene-specific sequence (bold). Similarly, the reverse primers were used to introduce B2 sequence (underlined), followed by the gene specific sequence (bold). The PCR products were cloned into the pDONR207 donor vector (Invitrogen), their sequences confirmed (Macrogen), and finally converted into the pDS-GFP-XB destination vector (Invitrogen). C6 cells in six-well plates were transfected with 4 \u03bcg of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged sense or antisense rat lcn2 cDNA by using lipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). An empty pEGFP vector was used as a control for the stable expression of lcn2. Stable transfectants were selected in the presence of G418 (800 \u03bcg/ml) at a period of 2 d after the transfection. Upregulation or downregulation of lcn2 mRNA or protein in the stable transfectants was confirmed by either RT-PCR or Western blot analysis, respectively.The short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences specific for rat bim cDNA (GenBank accession number AF136927) were designed using BLOCK-iT RNAi Designer software (Invitrogen). The nucleotides 320\u2013340 of bim cDNA coding region (5\u2032-GGG CGT TTG CAA ACG ATT ACC-3\u2032) were targeted. The oligonucleotide with stem, loop, transcription termination sequences, and restriction sites was cloned into RI and I site of pU6shX vector (small hairpin RNA expression vector; VectorCoreA) to generate pU6shX-bim. C6 cells in six-well plates were cotransfected with a 1:10 ratio of pU6shX-bim and pSV2neo containing the neomycin-resistance gene (Clontech) by using lipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). An empty pU6shX vector was used as a control. Stable transfectants were selected in the presence of G418 (400 \u03bcg/ml) at a period of 2 d after the transfection. Downregulation of bim mRNA or protein in the stable transfectants was confirmed by either RT-PCR or Western blot analysis, respectively.Recombinant adenovirus expressing rat lcn2-GFP (Ad-lcn2-GFP) was generated by Newgex. Briefly, cDNA encoding rat lcn2-GFP was inserted into the pShuttle-cytomegalovirus vector (Clontech). The pShuttle-cytomegalovirus with rat lcn2-GFP was linearized with I and cotransformed into BJ5183  along with the pAdEasy-1 (Clontech) adenoviral vector. Transformed cells were overlaid on kanamycin-containing agarose plates, and individual colonies were checked for the presence of the proper recombinant. After sequence confirmation, recombinant adenoviral stocks were expanded by infection of HEK-293A cells, followed by extraction. Adenovirus was semipurified from high-titer supernatants of infected HEK-293A cells. Supernatants were clarified by means of centrifugation to eliminate cell debris and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. C6 cells were infected with adenovirus expressing GFP (Ad-GFP) or rat lcn2-GFP for 2 d, and then cells were observed by means of fluorescence microscopy. Several randomly chosen microscopic fields were examined. Ad-GFP was used as a control.Recombinant mouse LCN2 protein was prepared as previously described (Yang et al., 2002). In brief, recombinant mouse LCN2 protein was expressed as a GST fusion protein in the BL21 strain of , which does not synthesize siderophore. The protein was purified by using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare), followed by elution with either thrombin or glutathione. For iron and enterochelin loading, a fivefold molar excess of ion-saturated enterochelin (EMC Microcollections) was mixed with the purified recombinant LCN2 protein.Primary astrocytes were seeded at 1 \u00d7 106 cells/well in six-well plates. After removal of media, 20 \u03bcg/ml fluorescent zymosan particle [zymosan A () BioParticles; Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate (Invitrogen)] was added to each well, allowed to settle by gravity, and left for 1\u20133 h. After unbound particles were thoroughly removed by three washes with ice-cold PBS, the medium was replaced. The samples were either observed by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus BX50) or analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSAria (BD Biosciences).Migration was measured by using a 48-well Boyden chamber (NeuroProbe). DMEM was placed into base wells separated from the top wells by polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filters (8 \u03bcm pore size; 25 \u00d7 80 mm; NeuroProbe). Cells were harvested by trypsinization, resuspended in DMEM, and added to the upper chamber at a ratio of 1 \u00d7 104 cells/well. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2. At the end of the experiment, cells were fixed with methanol for 10 min and stained with modified Giemsa stain (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h. Cells on the upper side of the membrane were then removed by using a cotton swab. The migrated cells were counted under a light microscope (Olympus CK2) (magnifications, \u00d7100). All migrated cells were counted, and the results were presented as mean \u00b1 SD (total number of migrated cells) of triplicates. For the  wound healing assay, a scratch wound was created by using a 10 \u03bcl pipette tip on confluent cell monolayers in 24-well culture plates, and placed into DMEM containing 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2 during migration of monolayer into the cleared wound area. The wound area was observed by microscopy (Olympus CK2) (magnifications, \u00d7100). Relative cell migration distance was determined by measuring the wound width and subtracting this from the initial value as previously described: cell migration distance = initial wound width at day 0 \u2212 wound width at the day of measurement (Bassi et al., 2008). A total of three areas were randomly selected and examined in each well. The results were presented as a fold increase in the migration distance: fold increase = cell migration distance at the day of measurement/cell migration distance at day 1.Embryos were collected from pair mating, raised at 28.5\u00b0C in egg water, and staged according to days postfertilization (dpf) as previously described (Park et al., 2005; Kucenas et al., 2008). Wild-type AB and () fish expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of GFAP promoter (Bernardos and Raymond, 2006) were used for this study.For mRNA injection experiments, a rat lcn2 cDNA containing a full-length open reading frame was subcloned into the pCSDest vector (Villefranc et al., 2007), and mRNA was produced by the Message Machine kit (Ambion). Generation of the lcn2 message was confirmed by gel electrophoresis of transcription reaction (data not shown). One hundred picograms of lcn2 mRNA was injected into the yolks of one- to two-cell-stage embryos. Expression of LCN2 protein in the mRNA-injected embryos was confirmed by immunocytochemistry (data not shown).Embryos were fixed in AB Fix (4% paraformaldehyde, 8% sucrose, 1\u00d7 PBS) overnight at 4\u00b0C, embedded in 1.5% agarose/30% sucrose, and frozen in 2-methyl butane chilled by immersion in liquid nitrogen. We collected 10 \u03bcm of transverse sections by using a cryostat microtome. For immunocytochemistry purposes, we used the following primary antibodies: mouse antibody to Zrf-1 (1:400 dilution; University of Oregon Monoclonal Antibody Facility, Eugene, OR), rabbit polyclonal anti-LCN2/NGAL antibody (1:100 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The relative length, thickness, and number of processes of zebrafish radial glia cells were quantified as follows: the five longest or thickest cellular processes for each section were measured. The total number of processes was also counted for each section. Seven zebrafish sections for each treatment were quantified. The results were normalized to the diameter of the spinal cord [(vertical diameter + horizontal diameter)/2)] and presented as mean \u00b1 SEM ( = 7).All data were presented as mean \u00b1 SD from three or more independent experiments, unless stated otherwise. Statistical comparisons between different treatments were done by either a Student's  test or one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple-comparison tests by using the GraphPad Prism program (GraphPad Software). Differences with a value of  < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.We have previously shown that inflammatory activation of cultured microglia and astrocytes induces their own apoptosis (J. Lee et al., 2001; Suk et al., 2002). Because of the fact that lcn2 is involved in the survival and death of a variety of cell types, we investigated how lcn2 participates in the cell death of activated astrocytes by means of a series of experiments: (1) stable overexpression or knockdown of lcn2 expression by transfection with sense or antisense lcn2 cDNA in C6 rat glioma cells; (2) adenovirus-mediated transient expression of lcn2 in C6 cells; and (3) treatment of primary astrocyte cultures or C6 cells with recombinant LCN2 protein. First, C6 cells with an increased or decreased expression of lcn2 were obtained by stable transfection with sense or antisense lcn2 cDNA. Changes in the lcn2 mRNA, as well as protein, expression in the stable transfectants (lcn2 sense transfectant, S3; lcn2 antisense transfectant, AS7) were confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively (Fig. 1). The stable overexpression of lcn2 enhanced the sensitivity of C6 glia cells to a NO donor SNP, H2O2, and paraquat (Fig. 1; supplemental Table 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), which have been previously shown to induce astrocyte cell death (Suk et al., 2001; Son et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2008). A similar result was obtained with another NO donor, known as SNAP (data not shown). In contrast, a stable knockdown of lcn2 expression by transfection with the antisense lcn2 construct decreased the sensitivity of glia cells to the cytotoxic agents (Fig. 1; supplemental Table 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Second, transient overexpression of lcn2 was achieved by using an adenoviral vector harboring lcn2 cDNA fused to GFP (Fig. 2,). The adenoviral expression of lcn2 also increased the sensitivity of C6 glia cells to H2O2, paraquat, SNP, and a combination of LPS and IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 2). Additionally, a recombinant mouse LCN2 protein was prepared and tested for potential cytotoxic effects (Fig. 3). The LCN2 protein sensitized primary astrocyte cultures to cell death, whereas LCN2 protein alone did not affect astrocyte viability (Fig. 3,). The cell death-enhancing effects of LCN2 protein were also assessed by PI and annexin V staining followed by flow cytometric analysis to determine the nature of cell death (Table 2; supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Treatment with LCN2 protein increased the sensitivity of astrocytes to apoptosis (PI\u2212/annexin V+ or PI+/annexin V+) as well as necrosis (PI+/annexin V\u2212). LCN2 sensitized astrocytes to NO-induced apoptotic cell death as well as H2O2- or paraquat-induced necrotic cell death. The cell death-enhancing effects of LCN2 protein were dose dependent, and statistically significant effects were observed from 10 ng/ml LCN2 (Fig. 3). LCN2, however, did not significantly influence the cell cycle distribution of either C6 glia cells or primary astrocyte cultures (Table 3). LCN2 concentration used in the current study is based on the previous reports. LCN2 is an iron-carrying protein and it has to be given at much higher concentrations to exert iron-dependent activities compared with neurotransmitters or cytokines. We and others have shown that LCN2 protein concentrations in the blood of normal mice are \u223c100 ng/ml (or 4 nm) (Flo et al., 2004; Mori et al., 2005). LCN2 is one of the most highly induced molecules in inflammatory disorders, whose concentrations reach 30 \u03bcg/ml in the blood and 40 \u03bcg/ml in the urine (Mori et al., 2005; Schmidt-Ott et al., 2006). Locally, even higher levels may be achieved in pathologic conditions. At 50 \u03bcg/ml, LCN2 induced kidney epithelia differentiation (Yang et al., 2002), epithelial transition of cancer cells (Hanai et al., 2005), and apoptosis of pro-B-cells (Devireddy et al., 2005) in an iron-dependent manner (Mori and Nakao, 2007). Purified GST protein (Fig. 3) was used as a control for the recombinant LCN2 protein. GST did not exert cytotoxicity or astroglial stimulation (data not shown). Although the effects of lcn2 were modest in some experiments, a similar result was obtained in the repeated experiments and showed a statistically significant difference.Inverse correlation between the level of lcn2 expression and the sensitivity of astrocytes to cytotoxic agents. C6 glial cells with an increased or decreased lcn2 expression were established by stable transfection of lcn2 sense (S3) or antisense (AS7) cDNA. The increased or decreased lcn2 expression in the stable transfectants compared with cells transfected with an empty vector (V2) was confirmed by RT-PCR (top) and Western blot analysis (bottom) (). \u03b2-Actin or \u03b1-tubulin was also detected to confirm the equal loading of the samples. Compared with the empty vector transfectant (V2), the lcn2 sense (S3) or antisense (AS7) stable transfectants showed an increased or decreased sensitivity, respectively, to cytotoxic agents such as SNP, H2O2, and paraquat (). Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of cytotoxic agents for 24 h, and cell viability was assessed by MTT assay. The asterisks indicate statistically significant differences from the empty vector transfectant (V2) treated with the same concentrations of cytotoxic agents (V2 vs S3 or V2 vs AS7) ( < 0.05). The results are mean \u00b1 SD ( = 3). The results in this and all similar experiments were repeated several times, and one representative done in triplicate is shown.Augmented cell death in the astrocytes that were infected with adenoviral vector expressing lcn2. C6 glial cells were infected with adenoviral vectors expressing GFP (Ad-GFP) or lcn2 fused with GFP (Ad-lcn2-GFP) for 2 d, and then observed under fluorescence microscope (). Magnification, \u00d7200. Overexpression of lcn2-GFP fusion protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis using rabbit polyclonal anti-LCN2/NGAL antibody in the virus-infected cells (). Virus-infected cells were treated with cytotoxic agents such as H2O2 (1 mm), paraquat (100 \u03bcm), SNP (0.5 mm), or a combination of LPS (100 ng/ml) and IFN-\u03b3 (50 U/ml) for 24 h, and then cell viability was assessed by MTT assay (). The asterisks indicate statistically significant differences from the GFP-expressed cells (Ad-GFP) exposed to the same stimulus ( < 0.05; Ad-GFP vs Ad-lcn2-GFP). Values represent mean \u00b1 SD.Recombinant LCN2 protein sensitized astrocytes to cell death. GST-fused LCN2 protein was expressed in BL21 cells, which was then cleaved by thrombin to release the pure LCN2 protein (). The GST protein eluted was run on the same gel for comparison. Treatment with recombinant lcn2 protein for 24 h enhanced the sensitivity of astrocytes to NO toxicity and oxidative stress (, ). Primary astrocyte cultures were exposed to the indicated concentration of recombinant LCN2 proteins with SNP, paraquat (PQ), or H2O2 for 24 h, and then cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay (, ). The LCN2-induced sensitization of astrocytes to NO toxicity was dose dependent, as measured by MTT assay after 24 h (). The results are mean \u00b1 SD ( = 3). The asterisks indicate statistically significant differences from the control treated with the same cytotoxic agent in the absence of LCN2 ( < 0.05).Flow cytometric analysis of LCN2-induced cell death sensitization in primary astrocytesCell cycle analysis of C6 cells and primary astrocytes treated with recombinant LCN2 proteinBecause it has been previously shown that a proapoptotic effect of lcn2 is associated with iron metabolism (Devireddy et al., 2005), the effect of either iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO) or iron donor ferric citrate (FC) on astrocyte viability was investigated. It has been previously reported that lcn2 containing the iron complex of the bacterial siderophore donates iron to cells via the lcn2 receptor (lcn2R/24p3R) (Devireddy et al., 2005). Internalization of lcn2 and its receptor leads to the uptake of iron from the siderophore-iron complex. The donation of iron to the cell leads to a decrease in transferrin receptor (TfR1) expression and an increase in ferritin levels. In addition, the donation of iron to the cell prevents apoptosis by decreasing the expression of the proapoptotic protein BIM. In contrast, lcn2 without iron complex binds to lcn2R/24p3R and is internalized into the cell. A putative intracellular mammalian siderophore iron complex binds to lcn2, which is subsequently released from the cell by exocytosis. Depletion of iron from cells results in the upregulation of the proapoptotic molecule Bim, which leads to apoptosis (Devireddy et al., 2005). Based on these previous observations and speculations, the role of iron and BIM protein in regard to the cell death-sensitizing effects of lcn2 was investigated in astrocytes (Fig. 4). An iron chelator (DFO) alone proved to be modestly toxic to primary astrocytes and C6 glia cells, and increased NO donor (SNAP)-induced astrocyte cell death with an additive effect (Fig. 4,). Because SNP may release iron along with NO (Kim et al., 2006), SNAP was used as a NO donor for this experiment to exclude the effects of minute amounts of iron released by SNP. In contrast, an iron donor (FC) partially prevented the NO donor-induced cell death (Fig. 4,). Moreover, lcn2-induced cell death sensitization was abolished by the concurrent addition of the siderophore\u2013iron complex (Fig. 4). These results indicate that the cell death-sensitizing activity of lcn2 in astrocytes is related to the iron transport and metabolism: apo-lcn2 may promote cell death by depleting intracellular iron, whereas holo-lcn2 containing the siderophore-iron complex may not. Bcl-2 family proteins have been previously implicated in the effects of lcn2 on cell death and survival (Yousefi and Simon, 2002; Tong et al., 2003; Devireddy et al., 2005). In particular, the upregulation of proapoptotic Bim expression was essential for the apoptosis-inducing effects of lcn2 (Devireddy et al., 2005). Thus, we determined the levels of Bim mRNA and protein in the LCN2-treated C6 glia cells and primary astrocytes. Both mRNA and protein levels of Bim were markedly increased by LCN2 protein treatment in C6 glia cells (Fig. 4,), as well as in primary astrocyte cultures (Fig. 4), supporting the role of Bim in the cytotoxic action of lcn2 in astrocytes. Although the effects of lcn2 were modest, a similar result was obtained in the repeated experiments. To confirm the role of Bim in the lcn2 action, Bim expression was knocked down using shRNA in C6 cells. Knockdown of Bim expression in the stable transfectants was confirmed by RT-PCR (Fig. 4) or Western blot analysis (Fig. 4). Stable knockdown of Bim expression by the transfection with the Bim-specific shRNA construct abolished the cell death sensitization effects of lcn2 (Fig. 4), indicating the important role of Bim in the lcn2 effects. In our previous report, proapoptotic effect of lcn2 on microglia was independent of Bim (Lee et al., 2007). In contrast to astrocytes, Bim expression was not induced by lcn2 in microglia. Although we have not done Bim knockdown experiment in microglia, there appears to be cell type-specific differences in the role of Bim in mediating the lcn2 effects.Role of iron and Bim in the LCN2 effects. Primary astrocytes or C6 glial cells were treated with DFO (, ) or FC (, ) in the presence of indicated concentrations of the NO donor SNAP for 24 h, and then cell viability was assessed by MTT assay. The iron chelation (DFO) and donation (FC) increased and decreased NO-induced cell death, respectively (). The LCN2-induced cell death sensitization was abolished by the concurrent addition of siderophore\u2013iron complex (). * < 0.05 compared with the same concentration of SNAP treatment alone. The expression of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein BIM was significantly increased by the treatment with recombinant LCN2 protein (10 \u03bcg/ml) for 12 or 24 h. This was assessed by RT-PCR () and Western blot analysis (, ) in C6 glia cells (, ) and primary astrocyte cultures (). The results were subjected to densitometric analysis, and normalized relative intensity of the bands is shown below (). Stable knockdown of Bim expression by transfection of C6 glia cells with Bim-specific shRNA construct decreased the apoptotic sensitivity compared with the empty vector transfectant. Knockdown of Bim expression was confirmed by RT-PCR () and Western blot analysis () of the transfectants. Bim shRNA-transfected C6 glia cells were treated with LCN2 protein (10 \u03bcg/ml) in the presence of SNP (0.25, 0.5, or 0.75 mm) for 24 h, and then cell viability was assessed by MTT assay (). \u03b2-Actin/\u03b1-tubulin detection or Ponceau S staining was done to confirm the equal loading of the samples. Error bars indicate SD. * < 0.05 compared with the same concentration of SNP treatment alone in empty vector transfectants. ** < 0.05 compared with the same concentration of SNP treatment along with LCN2 in empty vector transfectants.Previously, lcn2 has been proposed as an acute-phase protein (Liu and Nilsen-Hamilton, 1995), and the expression of lcn2 was modulated by inflammatory stimuli in macrophages (Meheus et al., 1993; Liu and Nilsen-Hamilton, 1995; Cowland et al., 2003). Thus, we sought to determine how the expression of lcn2 is regulated by inflammatory or other stimuli in astrocytes. The expression of lcn2 was strongly enhanced by LPS and TNF-\u03b1 (Fig. 5). Serum withdrawal, PMA, IFN-\u03b3, and ganglioside mixtures induced a modest increase in lcn2 expression. The secretion of LCN2 was also enhanced by LPS, as determined by Western blot analysis of astrocyte culture media (Fig. 5). The results indicate that astrocyte expression and secretion of lcn2 may be increased under inflammatory conditions in the CNS as in regard to macrophages in the periphery. The expression of the lcn2 receptor (lcn2R/24p3R) that has been shown to mediate lcn2-induced cell death (Devireddy et al., 2005) was detected in primary astrocytes and C6 glia cells (Fig. 5). Expression of another putative lcn2 receptor, megalin, was also detected in primary astrocytes cultures, but not C6 cells (Fig. 5), suggesting that the common effects of lcn2 observed in both primary astrocytes and C6 cells might have been mediated by 24p3R.Expression of lcn2 and lcn2 receptor (24p3R) in C6 glia cells and primary astrocytes. The expression of lcn2 was strongly increased by LPS (100 ng/ml) or TNF-\u03b1 (100 ng/ml) in primary astrocytes after 24 h treatment as determined by Western blot analysis. Serum withdrawal for 8 h (SW), PMA (100 \u03bcg/ml), IFN-\u03b3 (50 U/ml), ganglioside mixture (Gmix) (50 \u03bcg/ml), but not SNP (0.5 mm), treatment for 24 h slightly increased the protein level (). Secreted LCN2 protein was also detected by Western blot analysis of culture media after similar treatment with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 24 h (). Ponceau S staining or \u03b1-tubulin detection was conducted to confirm the equal loading of the samples. Normalized intensity of the bands is shown below (, ). RT-PCR analysis revealed that C6 glial cells and primary astrocyte cultures expressed lcn2 receptor (24p3R), which has been shown to mediate the apoptotic effect of lcn2 (). Megalin expression was detected in primary astrocytes, but not C6 cells (). The lcn2 receptor (24p3R) or megalin expression was not detected in the reaction without reverse transcriptase (\u2212RT). \u03b2-Actin was used as an internal control.In addition to the cell death-sensitizing effect, the LCN2 protein induced a morphological change of astrocytes in the absence of inflammatory stress or stimuli. When astrocytes were exposed to LCN2 protein, the number and length of cellular processes increased without affecting cell viability (Fig. 6). This was demonstrated by GFAP staining (Fig. 6) and phalloidin staining of actin cytoskeleton (data not shown). Because cAMP and cGMP are known to induce similar morphological changes (Bor\u00e1n and Garc\u00eda, 2007; Hu et al., 2008), forskolin and dbcGMP were both used for comparison purposes. The LCN2-induced morphological change was dose- and time-dependent (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). A significant change in cell morphology occurred after exposure to LCN2 at concentration of 100 ng/ml and period of 6 h. A similar pattern of structural changes in astrocytes also occurred after stimulation with LPS/IFN-\u03b3 or ganglioside mixtures (supplemental Fig. 3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), which have been shown to augment lcn2 expression in astrocytes (Fig. 5) and to induce glial activation (Jou et al., 2006; Yoon et al., 2008). The LCN2-induced change in the cellular processes was accompanied by upregulation of GFAP mRNA and protein expression (Fig. 6,), which was also LCN2 dose- and time-dependent (supplemental Fig. 4, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). This type of morphological change in astrocytes is similar to what occurs in reactive astrocytosis  (Boukhelifa et al., 2003; Lin and Cai, 2004; Wilhelmsson et al., 2006). Hypertrophy of cellular processes and increased GFAP expression are two hallmarks of reactive astrocytes after all forms of neural injury  (Wilhelmsson et al., 2004), suggesting the possibility that LCN2 may mediate reactive astrocytosis . Vimentin expression was, however, not significantly affected by LCN2. We next examined whether the LCN2-induced change in astrocyte morphology is related to the cell death-sensitive phenotype. Forskolin and dbcGMP, which both induced a change in the astrocyte morphology similar to that induced by LCN2, also conferred the cell death-prone phenotype (Fig. 7). Whereas dbcGMP enhanced lcn2 expression, forskolin failed to do so (Fig. 7). Both forskolin and dbcGMP, however, did increase GFAP expression, albeit to different extents (Fig. 7). Although the effect of LCN2 or dbcGMP on GFAP expression was modest, it was reproducibly observed in multiple experiments (data not shown). Our results indicate that dbcGMP and forskolin may induce morphological changes of astrocytes in an lcn2-dependent and -independent manner, respectively. Both forskolin and dbcGMP induced process extension and cell death sensitization. The major difference was that only dbcGMP, but not forskolin, induced lcn2 expression. Thus, cGMP may exert its effect through lcn2. In contrast, cAMP mediates its effect independently of lcn2. These results also suggest that morphological changes of astrocytes and their cell death-prone phenotypes are closely related, and that lcn2 carries out a dual function in the regulation of astrocyte cell death and morphology. In our previous report, LCN2 also modified microglial morphology (Lee et al., 2007). The cAMP and calcium appear to be involved in the deramification of microglia. In astrocytes, however, cAMP and cGMP led to process extension. Although we have not investigated the lcn2 dependency for all of these downstream events, the same pathway (e.g., cAMP) seems to work differently in the two cell types with different outcomes. In addition, although microglia and astrocytes share some of the characteristics such as secretion of inflammatory mediators, they show distinct morphological phenotypes when activated. Whereas microglia become deramified on activation, astrocytes show extended processes when they are activated. It appears that LCN2 protein is involved in both events, deramification of microglia and process extension of astrocytes. LCN2 secreted by activated microglia or astrocytes may mediate these distinct morphological changes and yet similar functional phenotypes.The effect of recombinant LCN2 protein on the morphology and GFAP expression of astrocytes. Addition of recombinant LCN2 protein (10 \u03bcg/ml) induced morphological changes in primary astrocyte cultures after 24 h (), reminiscent of those in reactive astrocytosis . Treatment with forskolin (100 nm) or dbcGMP (1 mm) for 24 h also induced a similar morphological change. Cells were double-stained for GFAP (green) and Hoechst 33342 (nuclei; blue) (magnification, \u00d7400) (). Results are one representative of more than three independent experiments. The length () or number () of astrocyte processes was measured by examining several randomly chosen fields under fluorescence microscope (, ). No significant cytotoxicity of the stimuli used was confirmed by MTT assay (). Error bars indicate SD. After primary astrocytes were treated with recombinant LCN2 protein (10 \u03bcg/ml) for 24 h, GFAP or vimentin mRNA levels were determined by RT-PCR (), or GFAP protein levels were assessed by Western blot analysis (). Ponceau S staining or \u03b2-actin detection was done to confirm the equal loading of the samples. * < 0.05 compared with untreated control.Role of cAMP and cGMP in the expression of LCN2/GFAP and cell death of astrocytes. After primary astrocytes were treated with forskolin (100 nm) or dbcGMP (1 mm) for 24 h, LCN2 or GFAP protein was detected by Western blot analysis (, ). Normalized intensity of the bands is shown below (, ). Primary astrocytes were exposed to LCN2 protein (10 \u03bcg/ml) or other stimuli (forskolin, 100 nm; dbcGMP, 1 mm) in the presence of SNP (0.5 or 1 mm) for 24 h, and then cell viability was assessed by MTT assay (). Error bars indicate SD. * < 0.05 compared with the same concentration of SNP treatment alone.Recently, NO has been shown to augment GFAP expression in astrocytes (Brahmachari et al., 2006). Because LCN2 also induced GFAP expression in astrocytes in our study (Fig. 6), we next attempted to determine whether NO is involved in the LCN2 actions in astrocytes. First, NO-induced GFAP expression was confirmed at mRNA and protein levels by using a NO donor SNP (Fig. 8,). The expression of vimentin used for comparison purposes was not affected. Second, the effect of LCN2 on astrocyte NO production was examined. LCN2 induced a significant increase of NO production in astrocytes (Fig. 8). The level of LCN2-induced NO production was comparable with that of LPS, and was not abolished by polymyxin B treatment, ruling out the possibility of LPS contamination in the recombinant LCN2 preparation process (Fig. 8,). Recombinant GST protein, which was prepared in the same manner as LCN2, was also used as a control to further exclude the possibility of LPS contamination (Fig. 8). LPS/IFN-\u03b3-induced NO production was completely inhibited by polymyxin B treatment (Fig. 8). Third, the LCN2-induced GFAP expression was blocked by a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor NMMA (Fig. 8,). Fourth, the LCN2-induced increase in cell death sensitivity was attenuated by NMMA (Fig. 8). SNP treatment alone also induced the typical morphological change that has been observed in LCN2-treated astrocytes (supplemental Fig. 5, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). In conjunction, these results suggest that NO production and LCN2 overexpression may form an amplification cycle at the upstream of astrocyte cell death, GFAP expression, and morphological changes.Involvement of NO in the LCN2 effects in astrocytes. After primary astrocytes were treated with SNP (0.5 mm) for 24 h, GFAP/vimentin mRNA or GFAP protein was detected by RT-PCR () or Western blot analysis (), respectively. The expression of GFAP was significantly increased by SNP (0.5 mm) in primary astrocytes. Primary astrocytes were stimulated with recombinant LCN2 protein (10 \u03bcg/ml), LPS (100 ng/ml), IFN-\u03b3 (50 U/ml), or a combination of LPS (100 ng/ml) and IFN-\u03b3 (50 U/ml) for 24 h, and then nitrite production was assessed by Griess reagent (). * < 0.05 compared with no treatment. Primary astrocytes were also pretreated with polymyxin B (PB) (10 \u03bcg/ml) for 30 min before the treatment with LCN2 protein (10 \u03bcg/ml), GST protein (10 \u03bcg/ml) (), or a combination of LPS (100 ng/ml) and IFN-\u03b3 (50 U/ml) () for 24 h, and then nitrite production was assessed by Griess reagent (, ). * < 0.05 compared with untreated control (, ) or as indicated (). Alternatively, primary astrocytes were treated with LCN2 protein (10 \u03bcg/ml) for 24 h or pretreated with NMMA (500 \u03bcm) for 30 min before the treatment with recombinant LCN2 protein (10 \u03bcg/ml) for 24 h. The expression of GFAP or vimentin was then detected by RT-PCR () or Western blot analysis () as indicated. After a similar treatment of primary astrocytes with LCN2 and NMMA in the presence of various cytotoxic agents [H2O2 (1 mm), paraquat (PQ) (100 \u03bcm), SNP (0.5 mm), and LPS (100 ng/ml) plus IFN-\u03b3 (50 U/ml) for 24 h], cell viability was assessed by MTT assay (). NMMA (500 \u03bcm) alone did not exert any cytotoxicity (data not shown). Error bars indicate SD. The single asterisks indicate statistically significant differences between treatments with cytotoxic agents in the absence and presence of LCN2 (* < 0.05; None vs LCN2; comparison 1). The double asterisks indicate statistically significant differences between treatments with cytotoxic agents in the presence of LCN2 and NMMA plus LCN2 (** < 0.05; LCN2 vs NMMA plus LCN2; comparison 2).Because the Rho subfamily of small G-proteins has been previously implicated in the regulation of astrocyte morphology (Suidan et al., 1997; Ramakers and Moolenaar, 1998; John et al., 2004; Hall, 2005; H\u00f6ltje et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2006; Bor\u00e1n and Garc\u00eda, 2007), a possible involvement of Rho protein in the LCN2-induced morphological change of astrocytes was investigated. Rho/ROCK pathway appeared to play a pivotal role in regard to LCN2 actions on astrocyte morphology, based on the following results: (1) a ROCK inhibitor, Y27632, partly blocked LCN2-induced morphological changes (Fig. 9,); (2) Y27632 also inhibited the LCN2-induced GFAP expression (Fig. 9,); and (3) LCN2 induced Rho activation in astrocytes (Fig. 9). Y27632 did not affect cell viability at the concentration used in the current study (data not shown). The LCN2-induced Rho activation was initiated at 1 h after LCN2 stimulation and sustained for 24 h (Fig. 9). In contrast, Rac1 inhibition by the pharmacological inhibitor did not influence the LCN2 effects on astrocyte morphology (supplemental Fig. 6, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), indicating the specific role of Rho proteins in the LCN2-induced structural changes of astrocytes. The Rho/ROCK pathway, however, did not appear to be involved in the cell death-sensitizing effects of LCN2, because ROCK inhibition by Y27632 did not significantly influence the viability of LCN2-treated astrocytes (data not shown). Because cell migration is a cellular phenotype that is closely associated with cell morphology, we next examined the effect of LCN2 on the astrocyte migration. As expected, LCN2 enhanced the capability of astrocytes to migrate on the basis of both  wound healing assay (Fig. 10,) and Boyden chamber assay (Fig. 10,). LCN2 accelerated wound closures (Fig. 10,) as well as migration across the membrane (Fig. 10,) (supplemental Fig. 7, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). As shown in Figure 10, the scratch wound was almost completely closed at day 4 in LCN2- or dbcGMP-treated astrocytes (for the microscopic data on other experimental days, see supplemental Fig. 7, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). The phagocytic activity of astrocytes was, however, not affected by LCN2 (supplemental Fig. 8, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).Role of Rho/ROCK pathway in the LCN2-induced morphological changes of astrocytes. Primary astrocytes were pretreated with Y27632 (ROCK inhibitor; 100 \u03bcm) in the absence or presence of recombinant LCN2 protein (10 \u03bcg/ml) for 24 h. Cells were double-stained for GFAP (green) and Hoechst 33342 (cell nuclei; blue) (magnification, \u00d7400) (). Measurement of the length of the longest astrocyte processes for each treatment was done (). Error bars indicate SD. * < 0.05 compared with LCN2 treatment alone. GFAP mRNA () or protein levels () were also evaluated by RT-PCR or Western blot analysis, respectively, after stimulation with LCN2 in the absence or presence of Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 (100 \u03bcm) for 24 h. \u03b2-Actin or \u03b1-tubulin was detected to confirm the equal loading of the samples. Results of densitometric analysis are shown below (, ). After primary astrocytes were treated with LCN2 protein (100 ng/ml or 10 \u03bcg/ml) for the indicated time periods or 24 h, the activation state of Rho was assessed by a pulldown assay (). The results are representative of three or more independent experiments.Stimulation of astrocyte migration by LCN2. Primary astrocytes were treated with recombinant LCN2 protein (10 \u03bcg/ml) for the indicated time periods, and then either wound healing assay () or Boyden chamber assay () was performed to evaluate cell migration (magnification, \u00d7100). Quantification of astrocyte migration was conducted after wound healing assay () or Boyden chamber assay (). Error bars indicate SD. * < 0.05 compared with untreated control at the same day.A zebrafish model was used to evaluate the expression of lcn2 and its functional role in reactive astrocytosis . We first examined lcn2 expression in zebrafish CNS. The labeling of zebrafish embryos with anti-LCN2 polyclonal antibody produced no signals at 2 dpf (data not shown), but LCN2+ cells were evident in the forebrain and spinal cords at 3 dpf (Fig. 11,). In the forebrain section, LCN2 antibody labeled microglia-like cells, which have morphology of microglia (Fig. 11, arrows). This is consistent with a previous observation that all macrophages undergo specific phenotypic transformation into early microglia in the brain of 3 dpf zebrafish embryos (Herbomel et al., 2001). Interestingly, in the spinal cords of 3 or 5 dpf zebrafish embryos, LCN2 antibody labeled cells having radial glial characteristics, long radial processes from the central canal to the pial surface of spinal cords (Fig. 11,). To further investigate cell types marked by LCN2 antibody, we labeled spinal cord sections with the anti-GFAP antibody, which is the marker for radial glia (Inagaki et al., 1994), together with the LCN2 antibody. All LCN2+ processes expressed GFAP, indicating that all LCN2+ cells are actually radial glial cells in the spinal cord of zebrafish embryos (Fig. 11,). To investigate the role of lcn2 in radial glia development and morphology, we injected synthetic mRNA encoding rat LCN2 protein at the one-cell stage of () embryos and labeled them with anti-Zrf-1 antibody, a marker for radial glial processes. Control zebrafish embryo did not receive any RNA injection as described in previous reports (Park et al., 2005; Maegawa et al., 2006; Hart et al., 2007). Because () embryos express EGFP in radial glia under the control of a  promoter (Bernardos and Raymond, 2006), and anti-Zrf-1 antibody labels radial glial processes (Trevarrow et al., 1990), EGFP+ cell bodies (green) and Zrf-1+ processes of radial glia (red) can be observed simultaneously (Fig. 11,). Consistent with  findings (Fig. 6; supplemental Figs. 2\u20134, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), the number and thickness of Zrf-1+ radial glia processes increased in most embryos injected with lcn2 mRNA, whereas the process length was not affected (Fig. 11,). Relative thickness, length, and number of cellular processes were quantified as described in Materials and Methods (Table 4). The process length may not be an appropriate measure of phenotypic change of radial glia, because most glial processes extend from the central canal to the pial surface of spinal cords.Expression of lcn2 in spinal cord of zebrafish embryos and its functional role in determination of radial glia morphology. , Anti-LCN2 antibody labeled radial glia in the spinal cord of zebrafish embryos.

LCN2 sensitized activated astrocytes in regard to cell death and also induced a typical morphological change that is commonly observed in reactive astrocytosis . The bifunctional role of LCN2 was supported by the following evidence: (1) a forced increase or decrease in lcn2 expression regulated cell death sensitivity of astrocytes positively or negatively, respectively; (2) recombinant LCN2 protein mimicked the effect of lcn2 cDNA transfection or adenoviral expression; (3) lcn2 expression and secretion was induced by inflammatory stimuli in astrocytes; (4) LCN2 protein induced GFAP expression and morphological changes of astrocytes; and (5) lcn2 RNA injection induced morphological changes of radial glia cells in zebrafish models, consistent with  findings. Based on these results, it is hypothesized that activated astrocytes may secrete LCN2 proteins under inflammatory conditions, which act in an autocrine manner to induce a morphological change of astrocytes and to sensitize activated astrocytes to cell death signals as a self-regulatory mechanism. At the inflammatory sites in the CNS, the number of astrocytes may increase by proliferation or inward migration with a concurrent change in the cell morphology, which constitutes a typical phenotypic modulation associated with reactive astrocytosis. Astrocyte-derived LCN2 appears to be one of the major mediators determining the reactive astrocytosis phenotype. In addition, the secretion of LCN2 may be part of the autoregulatory mechanism, by which activated astrocytes in the inflammatory sites could be eliminated. Microglia may also participate in this process by secreting LCN2 proteins (Lee et al., 2007). These findings are in agreement with previous reports, which proposed the role of secreted LCN2/24p3 in the termination of the immune response in the peripheral system (Devireddy et al., 2001) as well as in the CNS (Lee et al., 2007). Moreover, it has been previously reported that the production of erythroid and monocyte/macrophage lineage cells is also under the control of LCN2 in a similar manner to our findings (Miharada et al., 2005, 2008). LCN2 acted as an autocrine factor that suppressed the growth of erythroid and monocyte/macrophage lineage cells by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting differentiation.Schematic diagram showing the bifunctional role of LCN2 in cell death and morphological changes of astrocytes. Reactive astrocytes under inflammatory condition secrete lcn2, which may feed back on astrocytes to induce morphological as well as functional changes. lcn2 induces morphological changes of reactive astrocytes and promotes their migration through the Rho\u2013ROCK pathway. lcn2 also renders astrocytes more sensitive to cell death signals by regulating iron metabolism and Bim pathway, which may provide a basis for the self-regulatory elimination of reactive astrocytes . NO and cGMP appear to form a positive feedback loop that amplifies the lcn2\u2013Rho\u2013ROCK\u2013GFAP pathway. The morphological changes of astrocytes appear to be closely related with the phenotypic changes into cell death-prone astrocytes.In response to all forms of CNS insults, astrocytes become reactive and undergo the process termed reactive astrocytosis (Sofroniew, 2005). In this process, astrocytes proceed through proliferation and morphological changes, and experience the upregulation of intermediate filaments such as GFAP. Although reactive astrocytosis has been commonly observed under various pathological conditions, the molecular mechanisms underlying the reactive astrocytic phenotype are not well understood. Our current study suggests that LCN2 protein secreted from astrocytes themselves may mediate this phenotypic change. The involvement of lcn2 in the phenotypic change of cell morphology has been previously reported. lcn2 was an endogenous epithelial inducer (Yang et al., 2002) and stimulated the epithelial phenotype of transformed cells (Hanai et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2006). lcn2 also promoted tubulogenesis by regulating epithelial morphogenesis (Gwira et al., 2005). Although the role of lcn2 as an epithelial inducer as related to the effects of lcn2 on the astrocyte morphology found in the present study is not currently understood, it is evident that lcn2 has an important role in determining cellular morphology. A central role of LCN2 protein secreted under inflammatory conditions in the control of astrocyte morphology was supported by LCN2 neutralization experiments. When LCN2 was neutralized by adding anti-LCN2 antibody into astrocyte cultures exposed to strong inflammatory stimuli such as LPS and IFN-\u03b3, the induction of morphological changes was partially abrogated (S. Lee and K. Suk, unpublished data). Understanding the mechanisms involved in controlling astrocyte morphology is fundamental in the CNS research, because astrocytes interact with neurons and other cells in contact through their processes that are most probably influenced by the cell shape. Therefore, additional studies are necessary to gain a better understanding as to how lcn2 participates in the control of astrocyte morphology and interaction with neurons and other glia cell types in the CNS.The Rho family of small G-proteins has been frequently involved in structural changes of astrocytes (Suidan et al., 1997; Ramakers and Moolenaar, 1998; Avalos et al., 2004; John et al., 2004; H\u00f6ltje et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2006; Osmani et al., 2006; Bor\u00e1n and Garc\u00eda, 2007) and other cell types (Takai et al., 2001; Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2002; Heo and Meyer, 2003; Hall, 2005). Previously, it was demonstrated that RhoA negatively regulated astrocyte stellation (Suidan et al., 1997; Abe and Misawa, 2003; Chen et al., 2006; Burgos et al., 2007), migration (H\u00f6ltje et al., 2005), and the IL-1\u03b2-induced reactive astroglial phenotype (John et al., 2004). RhoA activation was, however, required for Thy-1-induced morphological changes in astrocytes that resembled those in brain injuries (Avalos et al., 2004). lcn2, in the current study, stimulated the growth of astrocyte processes and locomotive activity by activating Rho and ROCK pathway. Although discrepancies regarding the role of Rho/ROCK pathway in the astrocyte morphology cannot be fully explained, it is speculated that lcn2 may use additional signaling pathways in parallel with or downstream of Rho/ROCK pathway to induce morphological changes. Opposing roles of Rho proteins in the motility of astrocytes have been reported. In most studies, Rho activation has been associated with an increased migratory activity of astrocytes (John et al., 2004) and other cell types (Raftopoulou and Hall, 2004; Hall, 2005), which is consistent with our results. Moreover, Erschbamer et al. (2005) reported that GFAP-immunoreactive reactive astrocytes showed a marked increase of RhoA expression after spinal cord injuries, supporting the promigratory activity of Rho in reactive astrocytes. In contrast, the inhibition of Rho activities promoted astrocyte migration in a few reports (H\u00f6ltje et al., 2005; Bor\u00e1n and Garc\u00eda, 2007), in which the role of Rho in astrocytes may contrast with Rho-dependent mechanisms in other cell types. The Rho protein is a central regulator of cell morphology, contractility, and migration. Rho controls cell motility through the formation of stress fiber and focal adhesion. Cell motility is generally described as a cyclical process divided into alternating phases of protrusion and contraction (Pellegrin and Mellor, 2007). Based on the contractile nature of stress fibers, they are thought to provide a contractile force for cell migration (Kreis and Birchmeier, 1980). However, stress fibers inhibited cell migration in other studies, arguing against the role of Rho and stress fibers in cell motility (Couchman and Rees, 1979; Pellegrin and Mellor, 2007). Moreover, the coordinated regulation of the Rho protein family including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, rather than a single Rho protein, is believed to be important in the control of cell behavior. Thus, the role of Rho proteins in the regulation of cell behavior (such as morphology, migration, etc.) appears to depend on triggering signals, cellular contexts, and microenvironments under which cells are poised. In renal and cardiovascular systems, the RhoA/ROCK signal is related to inflammation, proliferation, migration, oxidative stress, matrix production, and tissue injury, which are in good agreement with our results. However, NO-cGMP signal is counterregulatory against RhoA/ROCK and antiinflammatory and organ protective (Oka et al., 2008), which is the opposite of the current findings in glia. These differences might be related to NOS isozymes expressed in different organs. Y27632 has been previously shown to have significant effects on morphology in rat astrocytes when used alone at lower concentrations than that used here (Honjo et al., 2001). However, no significant changes in morphology were observed after Y27632 treatment of mouse astrocytes in the current study. The discrepancy may be attributable to species difference.The results reported here were obtained by using cultured astrocytes and zebrafish models. The functional significance of lcn2 in regard to astrocyte cell death and morphological change  needs to be further examined in the mammalian system. Although lcn2 expression has been detected in a wide variety of tissues, its expression and role in the CNS has been addressed by few studies so far. Recently, genome-wide expression profiling has shown that LCN2 is upregulated in mouse brain tissues after focal cerebral ischemia (Trendelenburg et al., 2002; MacManus et al., 2004). The expression of lcn2 was also detected in the choroid plexus of mice (Marques et al., 2008). Additional investigations are necessary as to whether astrocytes are the major cellular sources of lcn2 in mammalian brains . Nevertheless, in the current study, lcn2 expression was detected in radial glia cells of spinal cord and microglia-like cells in the brains of developing zebrafish. Radial glial cells, which later transform into astrocytes, were the major cell types expressing lcn2 (see below).Zebrafish became an important model organism for biomedical research over the last few decades. Zebrafish traditionally used for the analysis of basic developmental processes is now widely used as alternative animal models for human disease and drug discovery purposes (Kari et al., 2007; Lieschke and Currie, 2007). Expression patterns and functional analysis of lcn2 in zebrafish revealed that lcn2 is strongly and uniquely expressed in radial glia cells, and induces morphological changes of glia  similar to those observed in cultured glia cells. Radial glial cells are believed to play a pivotal role in the developing CNS; they are involved in key developmental processes, ranging from patterning and neuronal migration to neurogenesis. Radial glial cells have long radial processes extending from the ventricular zone to the pial surface, and possess glial properties such as the content of glycogen granules or the expression of astrocyte-specific glutamate transporters and GFAP. After neurogenesis and migration processes are completed, most radial glia cells transform into astrocytes (Barry and McDermott, 2005; Stipursky and Gomes, 2007). Thus, the expression of lcn2 in zebrafish radial glia cells and the effect of exogenous lcn2 expression on the radial glia processes (Fig. 11) strongly support the crucial role of lcn2 in reactive astrocytosis . Previously, megalin expression in zebrafish was restricted to pronephros region (Anzenberger et al., 2006), arguing against that LCN2 protein may have been trapped by megalin-expressing cells.In conclusion, we present evidence that the secretory protein LCN2 is involved in the morphological transformation and cell death of reactive astrocytes (Fig. 12). The morphological change of astrocytes and their vulnerability to cell death appear to be closely related phenotypes. Activated astrocytes  may secrete LCN2 proteins not only to induce morphological transformation associated with reactive astrocytosis but also to promote cell death. This can be a self-regulatory mechanism by which activated astrocytes are sensitized to cell death signals in the CNS inflammation: on inflammatory stimulation astrocyte population expanded either by recruitment or proliferation may need to be under feedback control. The morphological transformation of astrocytes may facilitate the self-regulatory mechanism. However, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying the bifunctional role of lcn2 remain to be elucidated in future studies. Moreover, it is not clear at present what aspects are shared and what are distinct between the lcn2-initiated cell death cascade and morphological cascade. Nevertheless, our data suggest that lcn2 can be used as a drug target for the therapeutic manipulation of reactive astrocytosis and deleterious events that are associated with it.This work was supported by Bio R&D Program through the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation, funded by Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology Grant 2008-04090.

Altering normal motor cues can alter the HD cell responses and disrupt the updating of their preferred firing directions, thus suggesting that motor cues contribute to processing the HD signal. A pathway that conveys motor information may stem from the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), a brain region that has reciprocal connections with HD cell circuitry. To test this hypothesis, we produced electrolytic or neurotoxic lesions of the IPN and recorded HD cells in the anterior dorsal thalamus (ADN) of rats. Direction-specific firing remained present in the ADN after lesions of the IPN, but measures of HD cell properties showed that cells had reduced peak firing rates, large directional firing ranges, and firing that predicted the animal's future heading more than in intact controls. Furthermore, preferred firing directions were moderately less influenced by rotation of a salient visual landmark. Finally, the preferred directions of cells in lesioned rats exhibited large shifts when the animals foraged for scattered food pellets in a darkened environment and when locomoting from a familiar environment to a novel one. We propose that the IPN contributes motor information about the animal's movements to the HD cell circuitry. Furthermore, these results suggest that the IPN plays a broad role in the discharge properties and stability of direction-specific activity in the HD cell circuit.A large body of research has identified a class of neurons in the limbic system that discharge as a function of an animal's head direction (HD), independent of location and ongoing behavior (for review, see Sharp et al., 2001a; Wiener and Taube, 2005; Taube, 2007). A single HD cell fires action potentials only when the animal's head is pointed in a single direction, often referred to as the preferred firing direction. The direction in which an HD cell fires maximally can be controlled by visual cues such that rotation of a salient visual landmark can induce a corresponding shift in the preferred firing direction (Taube et al., 1990b; Taube, 1995). However, the preferred direction can be maintained in the absence of visual information and when locomoting into a novel environment, suggesting that internally generated information, such as vestibular, motor efference copy, and proprioceptive cues, are crucial for the stability of directional tuning (Taube and Burton, 1995; Goodridge et al., 1998). HD cells are found most prominently in the postsubiculum (Taube et al., 1990a), anterior dorsal thalamic nucleus (ADN) (Taube, 1995), and the lateral mammillary nuclei (LMN) (Blair et al., 1998; Stackman and Taube, 1998), as well as a number of other interconnected brain regions (Fig. 1). Recent evidence suggests that the origins of the HD signal may reside within the dorsal tegmental nuclei (DTN) and LMN circuitry because both structures are reciprocally connected and both contain neurons whose firing is modulated by angular head velocity and head direction (Groenewegen and Van Dijk 1984; Hayakawa and Zyo, 1984, 1989; Blair et al., 1998; Stackman and Taube, 1998; Bassett and Taube, 2001; Sharp et al., 2001). Furthermore, lesions of either the DTN or LMN abolish direction-specific activity in the ADN (Blair et al., 1999; Bassett et al., 2007). Although it is generally thought that vestibular information enters the HD circuit via a pathway originating in the medial vestibular nucleus\u2192 nucleus prepositus/supragenual nucleus\u2192 DTN (Liu et al., 1984; Brown et al., 2005; Biazoli et al., 2006), it is presently not clear where motor cues might be integrated. One possible candidate is the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) because of its reciprocal connections with the DTN (Fig. 1) (Contestabile and Flumerfelt, 1981; Liu et al., 1984; Groenewegen et al., 1986) and the finding that it contains neurons sensitive to running speed (Sharp et al., 2006). The IPN receives inputs from both the medial and lateral subdivisions of the habenular nuclei, with the medial habenula sending the strongest projection to the IPN (Contestabile and Flumerfelt, 1981; Groenewegen et al., 1986). The lateral habenula contains a small population of cells whose activity is correlated with the animal's movement speed and angular head velocity (Sharp et al., 2006), and it receives most of its inputs from the entopeduncular nucleus, the rodent homolog of the medial globus pallidus in primates, which is considered a major motor output pathway of the basal ganglia (van der Kooy and Carter, 1981). Thus, given this circuitry, the IPN is in a pivotal position to convey motor information to the DTN for integration into the HD cell circuit.Schematic diagram showing the principle connections in the HD cell circuit as well as a proposed model of information flow (Sharp et al., 2001a; Taube and Bassett, 2003). Arrows represent direction of information flow between connected areas. Black arrows represent excitatory connections, whereas the broken line depicts inhibitory connections. The DTN receives inputs from the nucleus prepositus, supragenual nucleus, and the IPN. The nucleus prepositus and supragenual nucleus both receive inputs from the medial vestibular nuclei, whereas the IPN receives inputs predominantly from the medial and lateral habenula. It has been proposed that IPN inputs into the DTN might be a source of motor input (Taube, 2007), which together with the vestibular information relayed from the nucleus prepositus and supragenual nucleus represent multiple idiothetic pathways of information about self-movement projecting into the HD circuit. Previous studies suggest that the projections from the postsubiculum to the ADN and LMN constitute an allothetic pathway in which visual information enters the HD cell system (Goodridge and Taube, 1997). Finally, the connections between the DTN and LMN appear to be central to the generation of HD cell activity. LH, Lateral habenula; MH, medial habenula; MVN, medial vestibular nuclei; NPH, nucleus prepositus; PoS, postsubiculum; SGN, supragenual nucleus.The present study tested this hypothesis by recording from ADN neurons in rats with lesions of the IPN. After an initial recording session that characterized ADN HD cell properties, we tested whether HD cells in IPN-lesioned animals could be controlled by a salient visual cue. We then tested the cells under two different conditions that determined their ability to process idiothetic cues and update their preferred firing direction without the use of visual landmarks. Here we show that IPN lesions not only disrupt the idiothetic-based control of directional activity in the ADN but also produce mild impairments in visual landmark control. The results suggest a broad role for the IPN in the generation and maintenance of direction-specific activity in the HD cell circuit.Parts of this work have been published previously in abstract form (Taube et al., 2006).Subjects were 27 female Long\u2013Evans rats, weighing 250\u2013300 g at the beginning of testing. Rats were singly housed in Plexiglas cages and maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle. Water was provided , although access to food was restricted as necessary to maintain the animal's body weight in the range of 85\u201390% of its free-feeding weight. All procedures involving the rats were performed in compliance with institutional standards as set forth by the National Institutes of Health  and the Society for Neuroscience.Before all surgical procedures, rats were trained to forage for food pellets scattered on the floor of a gray wooden cylinder (76 cm in diameter; 50 cm high). The floor was composed of gray photographic backdrop paper that could be changed between sessions. The inside of the cylinder was featureless except for a white cue card occupying \u223c100\u00b0 of arc attached to the wall that served as a visual landmark. The cue card was maintained at the same position throughout training. A black floor-to-ceiling curtain enclosure (2.5 m in diameter) surrounded the cylinder, and four uniformly arranged lamps were located above the cylinder to provide illumination. A color video camera (model XC-711; Sony) was centered above the cylinder \u223c3 m from the floor surface. Training continued until all animals spent 80\u201390% of their time in the cylinder foraging for food pellets (5\u20137 d). The purpose of this task was to encourage the rat to visit all parts of the cylinder and thereby sample different head directions at different locations.All animals were anesthetized with Nembutal (0.1 ml/100 g body weight) and given atropine sulfate (0.1 ml) to prevent respiratory distress. The animals were then placed in a Kopf stereotaxic instrument (David Kopf Instruments), and an incision was made to expose the skull. Rats receiving IPN lesions ( = 13) first had a small hole drilled into their skull above the IPN. Rats were then given either electrolytic ( = 7) or neurotoxic ( = 6) lesions of the IPN. Electrolytic lesions were produced by first lowering a #0 stainless steel insect pin insulated by epoxylite (except for its 1 mm pointed tip) into four midline sites of the brain. The insect pin was allowed to sit for 2 min before current was passed. At each site, a 1 mA current was passed through the insect-pin electrode for 10 s. The insect pin was then retracted and lowered into the next lesion site. Neurotoxic lesions of the IPN were produced by infusing 0.15 L of a 100 mm solution of NMDA into six midline sites of the brain. The solution was infused at a rate of 0.02 L/min through a 1 L beveled Hamilton syringe. Before infusing the drug, the syringe remained stationary at each injection site for 3 min; this procedure presumably allowed the tissue to settle around the syringe. After each injection, the syringe was left in place for 5 min before being slowly removed. The needle was wiped with water between each injection and helped reduce overlying cortical damage. Electrolytic lesions were produced at four midline sites (in mm): posterior to bregma (P), \u22125.8 and ventral (V), \u22128.7; P, \u22126.2 and V, \u22128.5; P, \u22126.6 and V, \u22129.25; P, \u22127.0 and V, \u22129.4. Neurotoxic lesions were produced at six sites, with each site being 2.1 mm lateral to bregma and with the syringe at a 14\u00b0 angle from the midline in the coronal plane (in mm): P, \u22125.6 and V, \u22128.8; P, \u22126.0 and V, \u22128.8; P, \u22126.4 and V, \u22128.8; P, \u22126.8 and V, \u22129.36; P, \u22127.2 and V, \u22129.36; P, \u22127.4 and V, \u22129.36. Electrolytic and neurotoxic lesion locations were based on coordinates provided by Paxinos and Watson (1998) and modified by previous histological results.All animals (IPN,  = 13; control,  = 14) received implantation of recording electrodes above the ADN using the following coordinates: 1.5 mm posterior to bregma, 1.3 mm lateral to bregma, and 3.7 mm below the cortical surface (Paxinos and Watson, 1998). Three of the lesioned animals were implanted 2 weeks after the lesions were produced, whereas the remaining animals were implanted immediately after the lesion surgery. Electrodes were constructed and surgically placed using methods similar to those described previously (Kubie, 1984; Taube, 1995). Briefly, each electrode consisted of a bundle of 10 25-\u03bcm-diameter nichrome wires that were insulated except at the tip. The wires were threaded through a stainless steel cannula that was moveable in the dorsoventral direction after being fixed to the skull using dental acrylic.After 7 d of recovery from surgery, electrodes were monitored or \u201cscreened\u201d for cellular activity while the animals foraged for food in the training cylinder. To detect cell activity, electrical signals were passed through a field-effect transistor in a source-follower configuration. Signals were amplified by a factor of 10,000\u201350,000 (Grass Instruments), bandpass filtered (300\u201310,000 Hz, \u22653 dB/octave), and sent through a dual window discriminator (BAK Electronics) for spike discrimination. The position and directional orientation of the rat was determined by an automated video tracking system (Ebtronics). This video tracking hardware provided  and  coordinates of red and green light-emitting diodes (LEDs) secured 10 cm apart above the head and back of the animal, respectively. The head direction of the animal was determined by the relative position of the red and green LEDs. Screening continued until each of the 10 implanted wires had been examined for HD cells or other cellular activity. Units were classified as HD cells if they fired maximally when the animal was pointing its head in a specific direction (the preferred firing direction) independent of its location in the cylinder and its behavior such as locomotion, grooming, or eating. If no HD cells were detected, the electrode array was advanced 25\u201350 \u03bcm, and the animal was returned to its home cage and monitored again either 4 h later or the next day. If an HD cell was identified, the animal was removed from the cylinder and placed in a cardboard box located outside the curtained area, and the apparatus was then prepared for three different tests (Fig. 2)., Overhead view of the landmark rotation and dark test sessions. Each session, except the dark test, was separated by a period of disorientation treatment. The floor paper was replaced, and the walls were washed to remove lingering olfactory cues. White noise was played from an overhead location during each session to remove potential auditory cues. , Overhead view of the dual-chamber test sessions. The door to the rectangle was closed during the rectangle session once the rat moved into the rectangle. The door to the cylinder was closed during both cylinder 1 and cylinder 2 sessions.The landmark rotation experiment was used to assess whether IPN lesions affected the stability of the HD signal and visual landmark control of HD cell responses. The experiment consisted of three separate 8 min sessions (Fig. 2). First, a standard session (standard 1) was performed in which HD cell activity was monitored and recorded while the rat foraged for food pellets in the cylinder. This session was followed by a cue-rotation session in which the visual landmark was rotated 90\u00b0 in either the clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW) direction. The rotation of the cue always occurred while the animal was in the cardboard box (i.e., out of the animal's view). Finally, the third session consisted of returning the cue card to the original position during the first session (standard 2). Between each testing session, the floor paper was replaced with clean paper and the cylinder walls were wiped down with 80% ethanol and a dry cloth to prevent the animals from using markings on the floor or wall as orientation cues. To mask auditory cues, white noise was played from an overhead speaker hidden on the ceiling. Animals were given disorientation treatments before each recording session by placing the animal in a cardboard box and rotating it slowly (0.2\u20130.5 Hz) while the experimenter simultaneously walked around the testing room twice. This disorientation treatment has been used in previous studies (Taube, 1995; Goodridge et al., 1998) and was used in this test to prevent the animal from using idiothetic cues to maintain orientation from one session to the next.An 8 min dark session in the cylinder was used to assess the idiothetic control of HD cells in IPN-lesioned animals. The test consisted of recording HD cell activity with the cue card removed and the room lights turned off (Fig. 2). Illumination of the head-stage mounted LEDs was reduced to the minimum level needed for accurate tracking of the animal's HD. Before the dark test, the animals were removed from the cylinder and placed in a cardboard box while the floor paper was replaced and the cue card was removed from the cylinder. To start the test, the room lights were turned off and the rat was gently placed in the cylinder and allowed to chase food pellets for 8 min. Similar to previous studies (Goodridge et al., 1998; Golob and Taube, 1999), animals were not disoriented before being placed in the cylinder for dark testing. After the 8 min dark test was complete, animals were removed from the cylinder and a final 8 min standard session (standard 3) was conducted in which the room lights were turned back on, the floor paper replaced, and the cue card returned to its original position. Rats were given a disorientation treatment before being placed in the cylinder for standard 3. White noise was played from a speaker on the ceiling during every test session to obscure potential auditory cues.The dual-chamber apparatus involves the animal self-locomoting into a novel enclosure (Taube and Burton, 1995). Figure 2 illustrates an overhead view of the dual-chamber apparatus, which is composed of two gray-colored compartments, a cylinder similar to that described above (76 cm in diameter) and a rectangle (51 \u00d7 69 cm) interconnected by a narrow U-shaped passageway (41 \u00d7 15 cm). The walls along one side of the alleyway were slanted by \u223c15\u00b0 for the overhead video camera to view all areas of the passageway. A section of wall in each enclosure could be removed to control access between the two sections and the passageway. The walls of the rectangle were featureless except for a white cue card positioned along the wall such that it was rotated 90\u00b0 CCW with respect to the cue card in the cylindrical compartment. The floors of the cylinder and rectangle were composed of gray photographic backdrop paper that could be changed between sessions and animals. The passageway contained a gray-painted wooden floor. The cylinder enclosure in the dual-chamber apparatus was similar to the cylinder the rats had been trained and screened in for several weeks, and, for that reason, the cylinder was considered a familiar environment to the animals. The passageway and the rectangle represented a novel environment because the animals had no previous exposure to them. HD cells in control animals typically maintain a similar preferred direction between both compartments of the dual-chamber apparatus (Taube and Burton, 1995; Stackman et al., 2003; Calton et al., 2008), and it is has been shown that motor/proprioceptive cues available during the animal's journey from the cylinder to the rectangle are crucial for maintaining a stable preferred direction.The procedure for the dual-chamber apparatus experiment consisted of three phases. First, the animal was placed in the cylindrical compartment of the apparatus with the door to the passageway closed (\u201ccylinder 1 session\u201d). After allowing the animal to forage for food pellets scattered on the floor of the cylinder for 4 min, the cylinder compartment door was opened and the animal was free to walk into the passageway and enter the rectangle. On entering the rectangle, the hidden door was closed, trapping the animal inside the rectangle environment while the activity of the HD cell was monitored for 12 min (\u201crectangle session\u201d). After the rectangle session, the door to the rectangular compartment was opened and the rats were allowed to locomote back through the passageway to the cylinder, where they were again trapped while HD cell activity was monitored for another 4 min (\u201ccylinder 2 session\u201d). The dual-chamber apparatus experiment was conducted only once per animal because the task requires the rectangular compartment to be novel. Thus, only one HD cell recording session was collected per animal in this task.An automated video-computer tracking system, sampling at 60 Hz, recorded the number of spikes occurring during each sample period while simultaneously recording the ,  positions of each LED. Data analysis was accomplished offline using custom software (LabView; National Instruments). The animal's HD was sorted into sixty 6\u00b0 bins. Basic directional characteristics of the recorded cells were determined by examining cellular activity during the standard cylinder 1 session. Cells from lesioned and control animals were compared on measures of peak firing rate, background firing rate, directional firing range, directional information content, and anticipatory time interval (Blair and Sharp, 1995; Taube, 1995; Taube and Muller, 1998). The preferred direction was defined as the directional bin with the highest average firing rate. The peak firing rate was the average firing rate corresponding to the preferred direction. The background firing rate was the average firing rate of all other bins outside the directional firing range. The directional firing range was defined as the width at the base of a triangle fit to a firing rate versus HD plot. Directional information content is a measure of how many bits of head direction information is conveyed by each spike (Skaggs et al., 1993) and was calculated by the following formula: directional information content = \u03a3  (\u03bb\u03bb) log2 (\u03bb\u03bb), where  is the probability that the head pointed in the th directional bin, \u03bb is the mean firing rate for bin , and \u03bb is the mean firing rate across all directional bins.The anticipatory time interval (ATI) is a measure of the amount of time that cell firing best predicts where the animal will be pointing its head in the future. Previous work has estimated that the activity of ADN HD cells reflect head directions \u223c25 ms into the future better than current head directions (Blair and Sharp, 1995; Taube and Muller, 1998). Both sensory and motor inputs into the HD network have been postulated as a mechanism for this anticipatory activity (Blair and Sharp, 1995; Blair et al., 1997; Taube and Muller, 1998; Bassett et al., 2005; van der Meer et al., 2007). In fact, previous work has shown that the removal of motor inputs can alter ATIs of HD cells in the ADN (Bassett et al., 2005). Thus, because motor-related signals have been found in the IPN (Sharp et al., 2006), it is possible that the IPN may play a role in this phenomenon. To address this possibility, we compared the ATI of standard 1 sessions in cells from control and IPN-lesioned animals using the methods of Blair and Sharp (1995). First, HD cell tuning functions were calculated by constructing firing rate versus HD plots by first dividing the 360\u00b0 directional range into 60 6\u00b0 bins and then calculating the average firing rate for each bin. Tuning functions were constructed for CW and CCW directions, and the difference between the preferred firing directions for the two functions (i.e., separation angle) was determined. The spike record was then shifted forward and backward in time in steps of 16.67 ms (the maximum temporal resolution of the recording hardware) and the separation angle between the CW and CCW functions for head movements \u226590\u00b0/s computed for each shift. The spike series was shifted incrementally \u00b16 times (\u00b1100 ms) relative to the HD series, providing 13 values of CW\u2013CCW separation angles. A scatter gram was then constructed from the 13 CW\u2013CCW separation angles and their corresponding time shift. The  intercept of the best-fit line of this plot is referred to as the ATI and is equivalent to the amount of time that the spike series has to be shifted to achieve overlapping CW and CCW functions.Circular statistics (Batschelet, 1981) were used to determine the stability of the preferred firing direction between the three dual-chamber apparatus sessions and the landmark rotation and dark testing sessions. Angular shift scores across testing sessions were calculated using a cross-correlation method (Taube, 1995). This approach involves shifting the firing rate versus HD function of the first session in 6\u00b0 increments while correlating this shifted function with the nonshifted function from the other session. The amount of shift required to produce the maximal Pearson's  correlation between the two sessions is defined as the angular shift score between the sessions. These values were then subjected to Rayleigh tests (Batschelet, 1981) to determine whether the scores were clustered randomly or whether the preferred directions tended to shift in the same direction and amount. The Rayleigh test computes a mean vector length () for the distribution of angular shift values. This  value represents the variability in the shift angles for the group, with values of 1.0 indicating an absence of variability. ANOVAs and independent sample  tests were used for group comparisons of the absolute angular shift scores produced during landmark rotation, dark, and dual-chamber sessions. We also performed an  test on the concentration parameter of the directional shifts between the cylinder and novel enclosure for the dual-chamber task to determine whether there was a difference in the variance between groups (Batschelet, 1981). This test examines whether shifts in the preferred firing direction are similarly concentrated around the mean value between groups (Batschelet, 1981) (this measure is comparable to angular variance in normal statistical analyses), an expected finding if lesioned animals have the same degree of orientation between the two enclosures of the dual-chamber task.For all experimental comparisons, HD cells collected from IPN-lesioned animals were compared with control data compiled from 11 unlesioned animals in the present study. To supplement our control data for analyzing the dual-chamber apparatus and landmark rotation tests, we randomly selected 29 HD cells from control animals collected in previously published studies using identical procedures and equipment (Taube, 1995; Calton et al., 2008). There were no differences between the control data obtained in the present study and the control data from the previous studies.At the completion of the experiment, animals were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital, and a small anodal current (20 \u03bcA, 10 s) was passed through two to four electrode wires to later conduct a Prussian blue reaction. The rats were then perfused intracardially with saline, followed by a 10% Formalin solution. Each brain was removed from the skull and was postfixed in a 10% Formalin solution containing 2% potassium ferrocyanide for at least 24 h. The brains were then cryoprotected in a 20% sucrose solution for 24 h and were then frozen and cut coronally at 30 \u03bcm sections with a cryostat. Every section through the ADN was collected, and every third section was collected through the IPN. Sections were mounted on glass microscope slides, stained with thionin, and examined under light microscopy to determine the location of recording sites and evaluate the lesions. To quantify the extent of electrolytic and neurotoxic damage to the IPN, digital images were captured at three rostrocaudal levels (5.8, 6.3, and 6.8 mm posterior to bregma) provided by Paxinos and Watson (1998). The area of undamaged tissue in the IPN was calculated at each rostrocaudal level using NIH ImageJ software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html). Tissue was considered undamaged if it contained healthy neurons and few glial cells. Once the area of undamaged tissue was calculated, the area of spared tissue was summed across the three sections and compared with the average area measured in control rats. The total amount of damage was calculated using the following formula: tissue damaged = [average area of IPN in control rats (pixels2) \u2212 total area of spared IPN tissue in lesioned rats (pixels2)/average area of IPN in control rats (pixels2)] \u00d7 100%.Figures 3 and 4 show representative coronal sections of controls (Fig. 3), IPN-neurotoxic lesioned rats (Fig. 3), and IPN-electrolytic lesioned rats (Fig. 4) at select plates from Paxinos and Watson (1998). The overall amount of damage to the IPN varied from 78 to 100%. Eleven animals ( = 6 electrolytic lesions,  = 5 neurotoxic lesions) sustained a 90\u2013100% complete lesion of the IPN, whereas one electrolytic lesioned animal and one neurotoxic lesioned rat had 81 and 78% damage, respectively. Because the anatomical evidence indicates that the DTN has reciprocal connections most prominently with the rostral subnuclei of the IPN (Hemmendinger and Moore, 1984; Liu et al., 1984; Groenewegen et al., 1986), it was particularly important that these rostral portions were completely lesioned. In the present study, all 13 rats had 90\u2013100% complete lesions of the rostral IPN. For many animals ( = 5), sparing of tissue was localized in the most caudal subnuclei of the IPN approximately at the level of \u22126.8 to \u22127.2 mm relative to bregma. Because there were no differences in the behavior and cellular activity of rats with damage throughout the rostrocaudal extent and those with lesions localized to the rostral IPN, all animals were pooled into one group., Selected plates from Paxinos and Watson (1998) showing the rostrocaudal extent of the IPN at relative coordinates from bregma. , An enlarged view of the boxed area in  depicting representative sections from a control rat. , Representative sections from a rat with neurotoxic lesions of the IPN.

The black arrows show damage that extends bilaterally beyond the borders of the IPN into the paranigral nucleus. , Representative section at \u22126.7 mm relative to bregma from the same electrolytic lesioned rat in . Notice that, at this level, the lesion is complete but extends unilaterally into the ventral tegmental area.Lesions typically extended into lateral and dorsal structures, including the paranigral nucleus, interfascicular nucleus, caudal linear nucleus of the raphe, and the ventral tegmental area (Figs. 3, 4). In 6 of the 13 cases, damage to these adjacent structures were incomplete and unilateral (<40%). Lesions to these areas were unavoidable because of their close proximity to the IPN. However, given that none of these areas are known to project directly to the DTN, or to any other brain regions intimately related to the HD cell circuit, it is unlikely that the damage sustained to these adjacent structures contributed to our experimental results. Six IPN-lesioned animals had minor unilateral damage (<30%) to the overlying parietal cortex. In four of these cases, the damage extended into the lateral border of the dysgranular retrosplenial cortex (<20%). Extensive lesions of the parietal cortex have been shown to impair some forms of navigation in spatial tasks (Save et al., 2001; Parron and Save, 2004) but have not been shown to disrupt HD cell generation or stability in the dual-chamber apparatus, dark tests, or landmark rotation tests (Calton et al., 2008). The retrosplenial cortex has been shown to have an important role in navigational abilities in rats and, when extensively lesioned, can impair navigational accuracy in several spatial tasks (Aggleton and Vann, 2004; Harker and Whishaw, 2004). Because very large lesions of the retrosplenial cortex are required to obtain these deficits (Vann and Aggleton, 2004), it is unlikely that the <20% damage in the two IPN-lesioned animals contributed to our results. In addition, a recent study (Clark and Taube, 2009) described four cases in which similar parietal and retrosplenial cortical damage was induced in rats without lesioning the IPN and found that the animals were unimpaired in IPN-dependent spatial tasks, such as a table-top homing task and the hidden platform version of the Morris water maze (Morris et al., 1982; Frohardt et al., 2006). In light of these considerations, we argue that lesions specific to the IPN were the most likely cause of our experimental findings.The electrode arrays were judged to have advanced through the ADN in all 27 animals (data not shown). A total of 128 cells were isolated within the sampling range of the ADN from the 13 IPN-lesioned animals. Of these cells, 54 were identified as HD cells, three cells were classified as theta modulated, and 71 cells had nondeterminable correlates. A cell was classified as a theta cell if it fired rhythmically in the theta frequency range (5\u201312 Hz) when its firing pattern was observed at a slow sweep speed (10 divisions/s) on an oscilloscope or listened to through an audio amplifier. Moreover, we identified whether its activity was correlated with periods of locomotor activity, a well documented behavioral correlate of theta rhythmic activity (Vanderwolf, 1969). Three control rats were removed from the general activity overview because of poor histology. For the remaining 11 control rats, a total of 93 cells were isolated within the sampling range of the ADN. Forty of these cells were identified as HD cells, five cells were classified as theta modulated, and 48 cells had nondeterminable correlates. An ANOVA conducted on the percentage of cells that had HD correlates in IPN-lesioned animals (electrolytic lesions, 39.0 \u00b1 7.04%; neurotoxic lesions, 46.6 \u00b1 7.60%) did not differ significantly from the percentage of HD cells found in control animals (46.2 \u00b1 5.61%; (2,21) = 0.386;  = 0.684). The incidence rate of HD cells (percentage of HD cells in the ADN) in intact animals is similar to previous reports (Taube, 1995; Bassett et al., 2007). Table 1 shows the incidence rates for HD cells in lesioned and unlesioned animals.Incidence of HD cell versus non-HD cells in lesioned and control ratsForty of 54 HD cells from IPN-lesioned animals and 36 of 40 HD cells from control rats were considered to be well isolated from background noise during the standard cylinder 1 session and were used in the following analyses. Because the basic directional characteristics of cells recorded from electrolytic ( = 13) and neurotoxic ( = 27) lesioned animals were not significantly different ((38) = 1.55, \u22120.985, 1.74, 0.218, \u22121.73, for peak firing rate, background firing rate, directional information content, directional firing range, and ATI, respectively; all  values > 0.05), we pooled the HD cells from both lesion groups into one group. Table 2 shows the mean and SE for peak firing rate, background firing rate, directional information content, directional firing range, and ATI for HD cells recorded in lesioned and control animals. As shown in the table, there were no obvious differences between lesioned animals and controls on measures of background firing rate and directional information content. This was confirmed by nonsignificant independent sample  tests for the two measures ((74) = 1.22 and \u22120.069 for background firing rate and directional information content, respectively;  > 0.05). IPN lesions did, however, significantly reduce the mean peak firing rate of HD cells by 21% relative to controls ((74) = 2.0;  = 0.049). Interestingly, previous work has shown that the removal of normal motor cues by passively rotating the animals through the preferred directions of the cells have generally shown that the firing rate of HD cells is markedly attenuated and, in many cases, completely abolished (Taube et al., 1990b; Knierim et al., 1995; Taube, 1995). Because these studies used a restraint protocol in which an animal is tightly wrapped in a towel, it was possible that the reduction in firing rate may have resulted from several potential confounds, including stress and body pressure. To avoid these confounds, Zugaro et al. (2001) substantially reduced motor cues instead by passively moving the animal on a wheeled cart and demonstrating that HD cells reduced their peak firing rate by as much as 27%. Our findings are consistent with the results of this latter study, suggesting that the IPN may be involved in setting the gain of the directional signal in the ADN, possibly through the network of movement-sensitive neurons found throughout the IPN (Sharp et al., 2006).ADN HD cell parameters in IPN-lesioned and control animalsAdditional analysis revealed that animals with IPN lesions had wider directional firing ranges than control rats ((74) = \u22123.08;  = 0.003). The larger directional firing range in IPN-lesioned rats could arise from drift in the preferred firing direction of the cell during the standard 1 session. Moreover, a drift in the preferred firing direction could have contributed to the reduced peak firing rates described above. To address this issue, we compared the absolute angular shift in the preferred firing direction between the first and last 2 min of the standard 1 session for control and lesioned animals. This analysis failed to reveal a statistically significant difference between the populations ((74) = 1.41;  > 0.05). Thus, because the preferred directions are similar between the first and last 2 min of the standard session, it is unlikely that drift in the preferred directions contributed to the wider directional firing ranges found in IPN-lesioned animals.Five HD cells from the IPN lesion group and three HD cells from the control group were removed from the ATI analysis because of contamination by a second cell (this contamination did not alter the firing properties described above). Figure 5 shows a histogram of the ATI values of HD cells from both groups of animals. Note that the ATI values from IPN-lesioned animals generally fell on the right side of the histogram, whereas the ATI values from control animals fell on the left side. The ATI analysis revealed that animals with IPN lesions had HD cells that anticipated the animals future head position by a significantly greater amount than control rats ((66) = \u22122.96;  = 0.004). Indeed, the ATI values of IPN-lesioned animals (64.7 ms) more than doubled that of the control animals (32.4 ms), a result that is similar to previous reports in which HD cells were recorded while animals were passively moved through their preferred firing direction, thereby removing normal motor cues (Bassett et al., 2005, their Table 1). The increase in ATI values is consistent with two other lesions studies: after bilateral lesions of the postsubiculum (Goodridge and Taube, 1997) and after unilateral lesions of the LMN (Blair et al., 1999). In each case, lesions of the postsubiculum or LMN led to greater anticipation from recordings in the rat ADN. In the case of the postsubiculum lesions, HD cell anticipation doubled that of controls, a result that mirrors our results. Nonetheless, the greater anticipation observed in the present study may be attributable to the larger firing range of HD cells in IPN-lesioned rats, because previous studies have shown that directional firing range values are positively correlated with ATI values (Blair et al., 1997; Goodridge and Taube, 1997; Taube and Muller, 1998).Histogram showing the ATI values (milliseconds) for HD cells recorded in the control (open bars) and IPN-lesioned (filled bars) groups. Notice that the many of the HD cells from lesioned rats have greater ATI values than those recorded in control animals.A total of 29 HD cells from IPN-lesioned animals and 33 HD cells from control rats were recorded in the landmark rotation test. Twenty-two of the 33 control cells were drawn from a previous study using identical procedures (Taube, 1995; Calton et al., 2008). Because the results obtained from landmark rotation testing did not differ between the two control groups, we pooled the data for statistical comparisons with the lesioned animals. Moreover, the results of landmark rotation testing did not indicate differences between the neurotoxic ( = 19) and electrolytic ( = 10) lesion groups ((27) = 0.305 and \u22120.763 for landmark rotation and returns, respectively;  values > 0.05); thus, for simplicity, we pooled the data for these animals. Figure 6 presents polar plots of the angular shift between the standard 1 and rotation sessions, and Figure 6 presents the shift between standard 1 and standard 2 sessions for each cell in control and IPN-lesioned groups. The plots in Figure 6 show that cells from control animals (left panel) demonstrate reliable shifts of the preferred direction in the expected direction and amount as the cue card, whereas HD cells recorded from IPN-lesioned animals (right panel) fail to show similar reliable shifts. On average, HD cells from IPN-lesioned animals had greater absolute deviations from the expected 90\u00b0 (mean absolute deviation from expected, 65.2 \u00b1 13.0\u00b0) compared with cells recorded in control animals (mean absolute deviation from expected, 11.1 \u00b1 1.79\u00b0). This difference in mean absolute deviation was significantly different ((60) = 4.38;  < 0.001), however, a Rayleigh test revealed that both groups had significantly nonrandom distributions (IPN lesion: mean vector lengths, () = 0.452,  = 0.0015; control:  = 0.969,  < 0.001)., Polar plots showing the angular shift in the preferred firing direction between the standard 1 and rotation sessions for control (left) and IPN-lesioned (right) rats. Each dot on the periphery represents the magnitude of the shift in the preferred firing direction for one HD cell. For the control group, the gray circles represent the shift values for animals included in the present study, and the black circles represent shift values from previous studies. For the IPN-lesioned group, the white circles represent the shift values for electrolytic lesioned animals, and the black circles represent the shift values from neurotoxic lesioned rats. The black arrow denotes the observed mean vector angle, and the broken line denotes the expected 90\u00b0 vector if the angular shift values are perfectly predicted by the cue card. Mean vector length values () are indicated within the plot and are depicted by the length of the solid arrow. The length of  represents the variability in the shift angles for the group, with values of 1.0 indicating an absence of variability. Asterisks mark  values that tested significantly nonrandom as indicated by the Rayleigh test (** < 0.01; *** < 0.001). For both groups, most cells exhibited a change in the preferred firing direction after the cue card rotation. Note that, although the variability in the shifts is much greater in IPN-lesioned rats, the shifts were distributed nonrandomly for both groups. , Polar plots showing the angular shift in the preferred firing direction between the standard 1 and standard 2 sessions for control (left) and IPN-lesioned (right) rats. The 0\u00b0 point indicates the expected vector if the shift values are perfectly predicted by the cue card rotation. Again, the shifts for IPN-lesioned rats are more variable but are distributed nonrandomly.The nonrandomness of the distribution of angular shifts for IPN-lesioned animals may stem from the fact that the preferred firing directions shifted in the expected direction (23 times) more frequently than the unexpected direction (six times). This result indicates that the cue card had some control over the preferred firing directions. One possibility is that the control exerted by the visual landmark may have improved after repeated exposure to the cylinder/cue card during screening and recording sessions. To investigate this possibility, we calculated the total number of screening/recording sessions that each animal experienced before recording an HD cell in the landmark rotation test and correlated these values with the absolute angular deviation from the expected 90\u00b0. We predicted that, if the cue card gradually gained control of the preferred firing direction as the lesioned animal had more exposure to the cylinder/cue card, we would find a negative correlation between the number of sessions and the absolute angular deviation scores. Although a trend toward a negative relationship was observed between the number of sessions and absolute shift scores ( = \u22120.16), this relationship failed to reach significance ( > 0.05). This result suggests that the small amount of cue control observed in IPN-lesioned animals is unlikely to stem from repeated exposure to the cylinder and cue card.Because of poor isolation during the standard 2 session, three HD cells from IPN-lesioned animals and five HD cells from intact animals were not recorded during the subsequent standard 2 sessions. The plots in Figure 6 show the angular shift scores between the standard 1 and standard 2 sessions. The right plot indicates that the preferred firing directions of HD cells in IPN-lesioned animals did not always return to the standard 1 orientation. An independent sample  test confirms this observation by showing that IPN-lesioned rats had much greater absolute shift values between standard 1 and standard 2 sessions (43.4 \u00b1 9.73\u00b0) than those obtained from control rats (7.07 \u00b1 1.31\u00b0; (52) = 3.84;  < 0.001). Nonetheless, a Rayleigh analysis revealed that both groups had nonrandom distributions (IPN lesion,  = 0.598,  < 0.001; control,  = 0.986,  < 0.001), showing again that the cue card has some control over the preferred firing directions in lesioned rats.The top panel of Figure 7 presents a representative HD cell recorded in an intact animal in which the preferred firing direction shifted in the correct direction and amount when the cue card was rotated 90\u00b0 CCW. The bottom panel of Figure 7 shows an example of a cell recorded in an IPN-lesioned rat in which the preferred firing direction shifted in the opposite direction after a 90\u00b0 CCW cue card rotation. However, when the cue card was returned, the preferred direction shifted back to its original orientation.Responses of HD cells from representative control (top) and IPN-lesioned (bottom) rats during the landmark rotation sessions. The dash\u2013dot lines indicate the standard 1 sessions, the solid lines indicate the standard 2 sessions, and the dashed lines represent the rotation session. For both animals, the cue card was rotated 90\u00b0 CCW. Note that the preferred firing direction of the cell from the control animal shifted in the correct direction and amount. In contrast, the preferred firing direction of the cell recorded in the IPN-lesioned rat shifted in the wrong direction (CW) during the rotation session but followed the cue card back to its original angular location during the standard 2 session.On a final note, although there were no significant differences in the mean deviation from expected scores between electrolytic and neurotoxic lesioned animals, there were some qualitative differences between the groups. Specifically, electrolytic lesioned animals had more cells that displayed preferred directions that under-rotated or shifted in the opposite direction in response to cue rotations. In contrast, many more cells from neurotoxic lesioned rats over-rotated in response to cue card rotations. We evaluated whether this difference was significant using a Pearson's \u03c72 and found that the type of lesion was significantly associated with whether or not the preferred directions of HD cells over-rotated (\u03c7(1) = 8.6;  = 0.003). It is unclear why HD cells in electrolytic and neurotoxic lesioned rats would show different responses in this testing condition, although it is possible that this result is attributable to chance because there were fewer cells recorded from electrolytic lesioned animals (10 vs 19 in neurotoxic animals) and because there were no significant or qualitative differences between the lesion groups when the cue card was returned to the standard location. Alternatively, it is possible that this difference is the result of damaged fibers of passage after electrolytic lesions but not in neurotoxic lesioned rats. One possible fiber tract that may have been damaged is the mammillotegmental tract, which is located dorsal to the IPN at its most rostral extent (Hayakawa and Zyo, 1989). The mammillotegmental tract contains axons connecting the LMN and DTN, both of which are essential for normal HD cell activity in the ADN (Blair et al., 1999; Bassett et al., 2007). However, it is unclear why damage to this tract would result in differences in the landmark rotation test but no significant differences in the cells firing properties or their response to other cue manipulations (see below).Together, the results of the cue rotation sessions demonstrate that the cue card was less capable of exerting control over the preferred firing direction of ADN HD cells in IPN-lesioned animals. Nonetheless, the significantly nonrandom distributions when the cue card was rotated suggest that some cue control was still present. The loss of cue card control over HD cells in IPN-lesioned animals is milder than in studies in which rats were given neurotoxic lesions of the postsubiculum (Goodridge and Taube, 1997). For instance, cells in postsubiculum-lesioned animals rotated in the expected direction less frequently (27 of 61 sessions, 44%) than the cells reported for IPN-lesioned animals (23 of 29 sessions, 79%). Furthermore, Goodridge and Taube (1997) reported higher mean absolute shift values for postsubiculum-lesioned animals in the cue rotation sessions (standard 1 to rotation, 76.4 \u00b1 11.7\u00b0; standard 1 to standard 2, 65.6 \u00b1 10.6\u00b0) compared with the means reported in the present study for IPN-lesioned rats (standard 1 to rotation, 65.2 \u00b1 13.0\u00b0; standard 1 to standard 2, 48.4 \u00b1 9.73\u00b0).We recorded 25 HD cells from IPN-lesioned animals and 17 cells from control rats in the cylindrical enclosure with the cue card removed and the room lights turned off. Three HD cells from IPN-lesioned rats and one cell from the control group were not recorded in the third standard session because of poor isolation. Because there were no significant differences in the amount of drift in the dark tests between neurotoxic ( = 18) and electrolytic ( = 7) lesion groups ((1,66) = 0.767;  > 0.05), we pooled the data for statistical comparisons with intact animals. Figure 8 shows the directional correlates of an HD cell from a control (top panel) and IPN-lesioned (bottom panel) animal during the standard 2, dark test, and standard 3 sessions. Each circle in the plot represents the animal's HD and time (resolution = \n16 of a second) in which a recorded HD cell fired at a rate \u226550% of its peak firing rate (obtained from the overall firing rate vs HD plot). With open circles representing the standard 2 (0\u20138 min) and standard 3 (16\u201324 min) sessions and the filled circles indicating the dark test (8\u201316 min), the stability of the preferred firing directions of HD cells can be monitored across sequential sessions. This figure clearly illustrates that the control animal displays stable activity clustered within a narrow range of directions across the three sessions, a result consistent with previous reports showing that HD cells can maintain their preferred directions in the dark for brief periods of time (Goodridge et al., 1998; Knierim et al., 1998; Golob and Taube, 1999; Calton et al., 2008). In contrast, although the IPN-lesioned animal shows stable directional activity during the standard 2 and standard 3 sessions, the preferred firing direction of the cell drifts significantly across the 8 min dark session.HD versus time plots of a representative HD cell from a control (top) and an IPN-lesioned (bottom) rat during the standard 2, dark, and standard 3 sessions. Each circle represents the direction and time in which the HD cell fired at a rate \u226550% of its average peak firing rate. Open circles represent the standard 2 (0\u20138 min) and standard 3 (16\u201324 min) sessions. The filled circles represent the dark test (8\u201316 min). Broken lines further demarcate each session. For the control animal, the preferred firing direction showed little to no fluctuation throughout the standard 2, dark, and standard 3 sessions. Notice, however, that for the IPN-lesioned animal the preferred firing direction showed substantial drift during the dark test but not during standard 2 and 3 sessions.To quantify the amount of drift in the preferred direction, we computed an HD by time plot for each recorded cell during each standard 2, dark, and standard 3 sessions. We then performed a regression to fit the HD by time data and then used the resulting slope coefficient (in degrees per second) as an estimate of the amount of drift in the preferred firing direction. The resulting absolute slope values were multiplied by 480 s (8 min) to obtain the total intrasession drift for each cell. Figure 9 plots the average intrasession drift for IPN-lesioned and control rats during each testing session. On average, HD cells in IPN-lesioned rats had a greater amount of drift in their preferred directions than control rats during the dark test (IPN: dark test intrasession drift, 77.9 \u00b1 8.07\u00b0; control: dark test intrasession drift, 23.3 \u00b1 9.78\u00b0) but not during the standard 2 and 3 sessions (IPN: standard 2 intrasession drift, 25.9 \u00b1 8.07\u00b0; standard 3 intrasession drift, 35.7 \u00b1 8.58\u00b0; control: standard 2 intrasession drift, 27.4 \u00b1 9.78\u00b0; standard 3 intrasession drift, 22.7 \u00b1 10.1\u00b0). This result was confirmed by an ANOVA indicating a significant group \u00d7 session interaction ((2,116) = 5.25;  = 0.007). Follow-up comparisons further confirmed that the groups differed significantly in the dark ((40) = 3.14,  = 0.003) but not during the standard sessions (standard 2 and 3, respectively: (40) = \u22120.149 and (36) = 1.45;  > 0.05)., The mean and the SE for the intrasession drift (degrees) obtained for IPN-lesioned and control rats during standard 2, dark, and standard 3 testing sessions. Note that the statistical comparisons indicate a significant difference during the dark test but not for the standard sessions. , Polar plots showing the angular shift in the preferred firing direction between the standard 2 and standard 3 sessions for control (left) and IPN-lesioned (right) rats. Cells from IPN-lesioned rats had larger angular shifts than control animals but were distributed nonrandomly (** < 0.01; *** < 0.001).Although not statistically significant, one interesting observation was that the cells in lesioned animals had a higher average drift in their preferred directions during the standard 3 session (Fig. 9). It is possible that the dark test disoriented the animals, resulting in a slow drift across the standard 3 session. Alternatively, the preferred directions may have been slowly returning back to their original orientation after they had drifted in the dark test. This latter interpretation would suggest that the visual landmark had some control over the preferred directions of the cells. Given these considerations, we were interested in whether the landmark generally returned the preferred firing directions to their original orientation after they had drifted in darkness. To test this issue, we computed the absolute angular shift in the preferred firing direction between the standard 2 and standard 3 sessions for HD cells in the control and IPN-lesions groups. Figure 9 plots the angular shift scores between the standard 2 and standard 3 sessions. An independent sample  test indicated that cells in IPN-lesioned animals had much greater absolute shift values between the standard 2 and standard 3 sessions (54.6 \u00b1 11.6\u00b0) than those obtained from control rats (21.9 \u00b1 6.82\u00b0; (37) = \u22122.24;  = 0.03). Nonetheless, a Rayleigh analysis revealed that both groups had nonrandom distributions (IPN lesion,  = 0.489,  = 0.003; control,  = 0.837,  < 0.001), suggesting that the landmark had some control over the cells.Related to the present experiment, Knierim et al. (1998) reported that ADN HD cells in intact animals rarely returned to their original preferred directions if they drifted \u226545\u00b0 during darkness testing. However, if the cells drifted <45\u00b0, they returned to their original orientation \u223c50% of the time. Consistent with these findings, we found that, in the lesioned animals, 4 of the 12 cells (33%) that drifted \u226545\u00b0 in the dark returned to within 30\u00b0 of their original preferred firing directions during the standard 3 session. In comparison, 5 of 10 cells (50%) in the lesioned animals returned to their original orientation after drifting <45\u00b0 during the dark test. For control animals, none of the preferred firing directions of the cells exceeded 45\u00b0 of drift during dark testing, perhaps because of the brief duration of the session. In fact, only 4 of the 16 control cells exceeded 30\u00b0 of drift. However, inspection of the control data show that 11 of the 16 cells (69%) returned to within 30\u00b0 of their previous orientation during standard session 3. Considering the results of both groups, these findings suggest that the landmark can exert some control over the preferred direction if the drift in the preferred direction is small. However, if the drift is larger, then the landmarks have weaker control over the preferred firing directions of the cells. Thus, it is possible that the poor landmark control in the lesioned animals can be attributed to the large drift during darkened testing.To summarize, HD cells in IPN-lesioned animals were unable to maintain their preferred firing orientation during the 8 min dark session but were capable of maintaining it during the standard sessions in which the landmark cue was visible. The fact that cells in IPN-lesioned animals had large directional deviations during the dark test but not during other sessions supports the notion that the lesions interfere with the animal's ability to use idiothetic cues for stabilizing the preferred firing direction. The finding that HD cells were stable during the standard 2 and 3 sessions suggests that the visual landmark was capable of controlling the activity of cells in IPN-lesioned animals. Finally, HD cells in lesioned animals rarely returned to their original orientation after dark testing and may be linked to the amount of drift in the preferred firing direction during the dark tests.A total of 13 HD cells from control animals and 10 HD cells from IPN-lesioned rats were monitored in the dual-chamber apparatus. Seven of the 13 control cells were obtained from two previous studies using identical procedures and equipment (Taube and Burton, 1995; Calton et al., 2008). The results from both control groups did not differ significantly when tested in the dual-chamber apparatus and were therefore pooled into one group. In general, cells from control rats typically exhibited stable preferred directions when locomoting from the familiar cylindrical enclosure to the novel rectangular enclosure, strongly suggesting that intact animals used idiothetic cues to maintain a stable preferred firing direction when locomoting into a novel environment. A representative firing rate versus head direction function from the familiar cylinder (cylinder 1) and the novel rectangular compartment (rectangle) conditions of the dual-chamber apparatus are shown for a control and IPN-lesioned animal in Figure 10. Compared with control rats, cells from IPN-lesioned animals exhibited less stable preferred firing directions when the animal walked from the cylinder to the rectangle. There was a trend toward greater angular shift values between the cylinder and the rectangle for electrolytic ( = 4) lesioned animals compared with neurotoxic ( = 6) lesioned rats; however, this trend did not reach statistical significance ((3.4) = \u22122.39;  > 0.05), possibly because of the small number of cells in each group. Thus, for statistical comparisons with control rats, we pooled the results of both lesion groups. An independent sample  test comparing the absolute angular shift of cells from IPN-lesioned and control animals confirmed that the absolute angular shifts were greater in lesioned rats ((21) = 3.9;  < 0.001), and the variability in the directional shifts (concentration parameter) was greater for lesioned animals than for controls ((1,21) = 17.96;  < 0.001). Thus, whereas cells from IPN-lesioned rats showed an average absolute angular shift of 60.0 \u00b1 13.7\u00b0 between the two enclosures, cells from control rats had much smaller values (12.5 \u00b1 2.2\u00b0).Representative firing rate versus HD tuning curves for HD cells from representative control (top) and IPN-lesioned (bottom) animals in the dual-chamber apparatus. The solid line indicates the cylinder 1 session, and the broken lines represent the rectangle session. Note that the cell from the control rat maintains a similar preferred direction during the transition from the familiar cylinder to the novel rectangle. In contrast, the tuning curve for the IPN-lesioned rat demonstrated a large 54\u00b0 CCW shift.Figure 11 shows polar plots of the angular shift between the familiar cylinder and the rectangle for each cell in control (left panel) and IPN-lesioned (right panel) groups. Rayleigh tests were conducted on these angular shift values to determine whether they were distributed nonrandomly, an expected outcome if the animals were using idiothetic cues. The Rayleigh analysis indicated that angular shift values were distributed randomly in rats with IPN lesions ( = 0.483;  = 0.10), whereas shift values were found to be nonrandom in control animals ( = 0.971;  < 0.001). This latter analysis suggests that IPN-lesioned animals were unable to use idiothetic cues effectively to maintain the same preferred firing direction between the two compartments. It should be noted, however, that many of the HD cells (8 of 10) in the lesioned group had angular shift values <90\u00b0, suggesting that some updating by idiothetic cues was maintained. Nonetheless, the results are consistent with the findings of Stackman et al. (2003) who reported a similar distribution of shift values and Rayleigh scores after removal of normal motor cues (Stackman et al., 2003, their Fig. 3)., Polar plots showing the angular shift in the preferred firing direction between the cylinder 1 and rectangle sessions for control (left) and IPN-lesioned (right) rats. The plots reveal that the IPN-lesioned animals had larger angular shifts than the cells from control animals and were distributed randomly (*** < 0.001). , Polar plots showing the angular shift in the preferred firing direction between the cylinder 1 and cylinder 2 sessions for control (left) and IPN-lesioned (right) rats. Cells from IPN-lesioned rats had larger angular shifts than control animals but were distributed nonrandomly (** < 0.01; *** < 0.001). For the control group, the gray circles represent the shift values for animals included in the present study, and the black circles represent shift values from previous studies. For the IPN-lesioned group, black and white circles show values from neurotoxic lesioned and electrolytic lesioned animals, respectively.Figure 11 shows the angular shift scores between the original cylinder (cylinder 1) and return-cylinder (cylinder 2) sessions for cells in IPN-lesioned (right panel) and control (left panel) groups. The preferred firing directions of cells from control animals generally returned to the directions established in the original cylinder sessions (mean shift, 8.30 \u00b1 1.45\u00b0). On average, cells from IPN-lesioned rats had higher absolute angular shift scores (mean shift, 31.8 \u00b1 10.7\u00b0), suggesting that some cells adopted new preferred firing directions when the animals returned to the cylinder. Although an independent sample  test on the absolute angular shift values indicated a significant difference ((21) = 2.48;  = 0.022), a Rayleigh analysis indicated that angular shift values were distributed nonrandomly for cells in both groups (IPN lesion,  = 0.752,  = 0.002; control,  = 0.986,  < 0.001). Thus, the Rayleigh test suggests that familiar cylinder landmarks can exert some control on the preferred firing direction of cells in IPN-lesioned rats. It is interesting to note that, of the cells in lesioned rats that rotated their preferred firing directions \u226545\u00b0 in the novel rectangle, two of six preferred firing directions (33.3%) returned to within 30\u00b0 of their original orientation when the animal walked back to the familiar rectangle. In contrast, four of four cells that had directional shift values <45\u00b0 in the novel rectangle shifted their preferred directions back to the original orientation within the familiar cylinder. None of the cells in intact rats exhibited preferred directional shifts >45\u00b0 when locomoting into the novel rectangle, and all of their tuning curves returned to their original orientation when the animal returned to the familiar cylinder. Together, the observation of large shifts in the preferred firing directions may explain the poor landmark control after the lesioned animals returned to the familiar cylinder.To summarize, HD cells from IPN-lesioned animals were unable to maintain their preferred firing direction when the animal entered the novel rectangular section of the dual-chamber apparatus, suggesting that the animals were impaired at using self-movement cues for preferred firing direction stability. Thus, this finding supports the notion that the IPN is important for relaying motor cues into HD cell circuitry. In addition, when returning to the familiar environment, cells in IPN-lesioned animals displayed slightly larger angular shift scores than control cells. Although this latter finding did not lead to randomly distributed shift scores, the results suggest that IPN lesions can create mild disturbances in the ability of familiar visual landmarks to control the preferred directions.The present study examined the role of the IPN in generating and maintaining direction-specific firing in HD cells from the ADN. Although large lesions of the IPN did not abolish direction-specific activity of ADN HD cells, inspection of their firing characteristics revealed several major differences compared with controls. IPN lesions reduced the overall peak firing rate, increased the directional firing range, and increased the amount cell firing anticipated future directional heading. Furthermore, tests in lesioned rats revealed that the preferred firing directions of the cells were less influenced by a salient visual landmark. Finally, HD cells in IPN-lesioned rats exhibited larger shifts in their preferred firing direction than control animals when foraging in a darkened environment and when locomoting from a familiar environment to a novel one. The results suggest that the IPN serves a broad role in the generation and maintenance of the HD cell signal in the ADN. We suggest that, because of its strong connectivity with brain regions linked to processing motor information (Morley, 1986; Klemm, 2004) and the finding of movement sensitive neurons in the IPN (Sharp et al., 2006), its function is related to the signaling of idiothetic motor cues to HD cell circuitry.The finding that lesions of the IPN reduce the stability of HD cells during idiothetic-based tests is consistent with the proposal that the IPN is involved in the signaling of movement-related cues. Stackman et al. (2003) examined the degree to which motor cues contribute to preferred direction stability by passively transporting rats on a wheeled cart from a familiar chamber to a novel enclosure in the dual-chamber apparatus. Under these conditions, the preferred firing directions of ADN HD cells shifted significantly more than rats that self-locomoted to the novel environment, suggesting an important role for normal volitional movements in updating the preferred direction under conditions that most likely require path integration mechanisms. Our results were consistent with these findings as the preferred directions drifted significantly when the IPN-lesioned animals locomoted into the novel rectangular environment. An interesting correlation between the results of lesioned animals in the present study and the passively transported rats in the study by Stackman et al. (2003) is that the angular shift values of the preferred firing direction between the familiar cylinder and novel rectangle rarely exceeded 90\u00b0 (two cells in each study). This result implies that other idiothetic cues, such as vestibular or even other sources of motor information, may have had some residual control over the preferred firing directions of the cells. Nonetheless, additional testing revealed that IPN lesions induced a large amount of drift in the preferred directions when the rats foraged for food under darkened conditions. These findings suggest an important role for the IPN in the idiothetic control of HD cell activity.The idiothetic or path integration-based control of HD cells likely involves a number of processes, including, but not limited to, (1) the establishment of an initial direction, (2) the monitoring of idiothetic signals, and (3) the computation of the current heading direction based on an initial orientation and subsequent self-movement signals (Skaggs et al., 1995; McNaughton et al., 1996; Redish et al., 1996; Zhang, 1996; Song and Wang, 2005). Although it is possible that IPN lesions may have disrupted any one of these processes, we suggest that the structure is at least involved in conveying motor-related signals to HD cell circuitry (Sharp et al., 2006), likely through its reciprocal relationship with the DTN and its connections with the lateral habenula, which also projects to the DTN (Fig. 1) (Contestabile and Flumerfelt, 1981; Liu et al., 1984; Hayakawa and Zyo, 1985; Groenewegen et al., 1986). Lateral habenula neurons are sensitive to running speed and angular head velocity (Sharp et al., 2006), suggesting that information about self-movements is also generated in this structure. Motor/proprioceptive cues may alternatively be integrated into the HD cell circuit as early as the vestibular nucleus (Angelaki and Cullen, 2008). Evidence for this view stems from studies in monkeys showing that the activity of vestibular neurons is diminished during active angular head movements but not during passive movements (Roy and Cullen, 2004). Nonetheless, this finding is difficult to reconcile with the fact that angular head velocity cells in the DTN respond more robustly to active than passive head movements (Sharp et al., 2001b).The finding that the visual landmark exerted poor control over the preferred directions of lesioned animals was surprising given the absence of direct inputs from brain regions involved in visuospatial processing (Morley, 1986; Klemm, 2004). As shown in Figure 1, the processing of landmark cues is generally thought to occur in a circuit that includes the postsubiculum (Goodridge and Taube, 1997), a major recipient of projections from the visual cortex (Vogt and Miller, 1983), and several other brain regions involved in visuospatial processing, including the retrosplenial and entorhinal cortices (van Groen and Wyss, 1990; Burwell, 2000; Kerr et al., 2007). Nonetheless, it is possible that at least some of the poor landmark control in lesioned animals was the direct result of the large angular shifts in the preferred direction during the idiothetic tests (dark test and dual-chamber apparatus). Similar observations were made by Stackman et al. (2003) when rats were passively wheeled from the cylinder to the novel rectangle and then allowed to walk back to the familiar cylinder compartment. In this case, if the amount of shift was large when entering the novel environment, the preferred directions of HD cells did not return to their original orientations when the rats walked back to the familiar cylinder. Knierim et al. (1998) found a similar effect in darkened conditions. Interestingly, in the present study, the average absolute angular shift of HD cell preferred directions in both idiothetic tests was \u223c70\u00b0 for lesioned animals, whereas the average shift in both tests was \u223c17\u00b0 for control animals. These differences in shift magnitude during the idiothetic tests may have contributed to the moderate landmark control deficits observed in lesioned animals.The explanation above does not explain the poor control over HD cell tuning in lesioned rats when the landmark was shifted 90\u00b0 during the cue rotation tests. One possible explanation is that the IPN lesions produced attentional disturbances, perhaps by altering the ability to detect the degree of landmark rotation. An attentional hypothesis, however, does not account for the stable preferred directions of HD cells during the standard testing sessions versus the drift observed during dark testing, unless the attentional deficit has a greater impact on idiothetic cue control and has a milder influence on landmark information. Furthermore, during the landmark rotation series, the preferred directions rotated in the correct direction 79% of the time, suggesting that the animals detected changes in the landmark location. An attentional hypothesis is also difficult to reconcile with the results of a preliminary study showing that animals with lesions of the IPN can readily navigate to a standard cued platform in the Morris water maze but not to the hidden platform in a spatial variant of the task (Clark and Taube, 2009). Such findings suggest that the lesioned animals can continuously attend to cues directly associated with a goal location but are impaired at learning the spatial relationship of the goal with the distal landmark cues. This result suggests that the IPN plays a more fundamental role in spatial navigation.A second explanation for the moderate loss of landmark control is that the impairments might be secondary to the loss of idiothetic information. Recent theoretical work suggests that a stable spatial framework based on idiothetic information is required for visual cue learning in HD and hippocampal place cell networks (McNaughton et al., 1996; Samsonovich and McNaughton, 1997). For example, Knierim et al. (1995) showed that landmark control over HD cell and place cell activity was weaker in animals that were disoriented before each recording session (but see Dudchenko et al., 1997). Complete removal of vestibular information abolishes directional activity in the ADN and place cell activity in the hippocampus, despite the presence of familiar cues (Stackman and Taube, 1998; Stackman et al., 2003). Moreover, the removal of normal motor cues significantly reduces the spatial resolution of hippocampal place cells and reduces the control exerted by visual cues in a familiar environment (Foster et al., 1989; Terrazas et al., 2005). Together, these findings suggest that landmark information is learned in relation to idiothetic information and thus might account for the loss of landmark control in the present study.The IPN has been implicated in a variety of functions, including homeostasis, olfactory behavior, stress, sleep, nociception, and learning (for review, see Morley, 1986; Klemm, 2004). Despite the wide range of behaviors linked to the IPN, there has not been a similar investigation of its role in navigation. Recent findings from our laboratory show that IPN lesions impair performance in both path integration and landmark-dependent spatial tasks (Clark and Taube, 2009). Other studies report similar landmark navigation impairments when the habenula is electrolytically damaged (Lecourtier et al., 2004). Given that the IPN and its related circuitry are one of the major links between limbic forebrain, striatum, and brainstem structures (Sutherland, 1982; Klemm, 2004; Lecourtier and Kelly, 2007), future work should be directed at elucidating the precise role of this circuitry in spatial navigation and memory.This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant NS053907 (J.S.T.) and a PGS-D postgraduate scholarship from the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (B.J.C.).

An intriguing aspect of the data in Clark et al. is the observation \nthat interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) lesions increase (by about a factor 2) \nthe amount by which thalamic HD cells anticipate future head direction. \nIntegration of such anticipatory time interval (ATI) data with modeling \nstudies has been a useful tool in dissecting the HD system circuitry. An \nimportant question in this respect is whether anticipation in the HD \nsystem results from the same mechanisms responsible for updating the \nsystem in response to movement, or if the two are distinct. \n\n  Clark et al. find a dissociation of IPN contributions to the update \nmechanism (decreased accuracy if lesioned), and anticipation (increased if\nlesioned). This suggests not only that the putative motor contribution of \nIPN cannot be the source of HD anticipation, but moreover, that in the \nintact animal, such input serves to counteract anticipation originating \nfrom a different source. This interpretation is further supported by a \nprevious report from the same group (Bassett and Taube 2005) showing that \nwhen animals are rotated passively, thalamic HD cells anticipate more than\nduring active movement. Taken together, these data appear inconsistent \nwith the proposal that HD anticipation might derive from motor efference \ncopy, and instead support its generation from vestibular or network \nproperties.\n\n  However, anticipatory time interval (ATI) data needs to be treated \nwith caution. In particular, van der Meer et al. (2007) found a \nrelationship between the dynamics of head movements and observed ATIs, \nwhere rapid, abrupt and high-frequency head movements are associated with \nlittle anticipation, and smooth movement with high ATIs. In order to \nincrease confidence in the above interpretation of the Clark et al. ATI \nresults, it would be helpful to know if there are any differences in head \nmovements associated with IPN lesions that may account for the observed \neffect on anticipation.\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 by the Society for Neuroscience. \u00a0 Print ISSN: 0270-6474 \u00a0 Online ISSN: 1529-2401", "29/1/86": "Advanced SearchThe adult mammalian brain maintains a prominent stem cell niche in the subventricular zone supplying new neurons to the olfactory bulb. We examined the dynamics of synaptogenesis by imaging the formation and elimination of clusters of a postsynaptic marker (PSD95), genetically targeted to adult-born neurons. We imaged  adult-born periglomerular neurons (PGNs) during two phases of development, immaturity and maturity. Immature PGNs showed high levels of PSD95 puncta dynamics during 12\u201372 h intervals. Mature PGNs were more stable compared with immature PGNs but still remained dynamic, suggesting that synaptogenesis persists long after these neurons integrated into the network. By combining intrinsic signal and two photon imaging we followed PSD95 puncta in sensory enriched glomeruli. Sensory input upregulated the development of adult-born PGNs only in enriched glomeruli. Our data provide evidence for an activity-based mechanism that enhances synaptogenesis of adult-born PGNs during their initial phases of development.The adult mammalian brain maintains two unique neurogenic niches. One in the hippocampus and one in the subventricular zone (SVZ), which continuously supplies new neurons to the olfactory bulb (OB) (Altman, 1969; Alvarez-Buylla and Garcia-Verdugo, 2002; Lledo et al., 2006). In the OB of rodents, adult-born neurons give rise to different subtypes of interneurons, primarily granule cells (GCs) and periglomerular neurons (PGNs). This unique population has been hypothesized to subserve a role in the network's plasticity, but this issue remains uncertain and under continuous investigation. It is clear that OB adult-born neurons are fully functional because they become indistinguishable from older neurons morphologically, chemo-anatomically and electrophysiologically (Carl\u00e9n et al., 2002; Belluzzi et al., 2003; Carleton et al., 2003; Bagley et al., 2007; Whitman and Greer, 2007b). However, to understand their function, it is important to decipher their synaptic connectivity patterns within their respective networks, and to uncover how such patterns emerge (Toni et al., 2007).Adult-born neurons' chemo-anatomical specificity as well as gross an anatomical location (i.e., layer specificity) has been recently shown to be determined by the precise birthplace of the progenitors as well as by the transcription factor expression profiles therein (Hack et al., 2005; Waclaw et al., 2006; Merkle et al., 2007). However, synaptic connectivity patterns might be determined by factors other than neuronal chemo-anatomical type. Moreover, the mechanisms that shape the formation of this synaptic connectivity are unknown, leaving numerous questions open. For example, once early phases of development are completed, does synaptogenesis cease? If not, to what extent does synaptogenesis remain a plastic process? What might be the mechanisms that control synapse formation during integration into the network?One possibility is that the mechanisms that determine synaptogenesis are indeed completely intrinsic to the neurons, similar to the mechanisms of chemo-anatomical and layer specificity (Kelsch et al., 2007; Merkle et al., 2007). Conversely, another possibility is that local cues, such as levels of sensory input will shape adult-born neurons' development during the period of synaptic integration, as indicated by manipulations on neuronal excitability in hippocampal neurons (Ge et al., 2006; Tashiro et al., 2006).Here, we set out to study the mechanisms that regulate synaptogenesis of adult-born PGNs, . Using  two-photon imaging, we studied the structural dynamics of dendrites and putative synapses of adult-born PGNs, during their initial phases of synaptic integration into the network and after complete integration. We first describe the basic structural maturation pattern of putative synapses on PGN dendrites, which is a dynamically rich process. We also show that putative synapses of PGNs remain dynamic long after integration into the network, albeit at a lower rate. Combining intrinsic signal imaging, odor enrichment and two photon imaging, we show that sensory input accelerated synaptogenesis and dendritic development of PGNs only in enriched loci. Together, we describe the developmental process of synaptogenesis of adult-born PGNs and show that its initial phases are regulated by sensory input.We used male and female BALB/C mice or in a few cases M71\u2013GFP mice (Bozza et al., 2002) ( = 67 postnatal day 55\u201380). Of the 67 mice, 51 mice were used for  imaging and for fixed tissue analysis, 6 mice were processed for TEM and 10 mice were used for ISI calibration and experiments. M71\u2013GFP mice express GFP in a subset of ORNs serving here as  morphological indicators that the OB is healthy. There were no evident differences between BALB/C and M71\u2013GFP mice. For TEM analysis we also used a single YFP mouse (Feng et al., 2000) line-H. Animal care and experiments were approved by the Hebrew University Animal Care and Use Committee.For synaptic labeling we used lenti-PSD95-GFP controlled by the Elongation\u2013Factor\u20131\u2013\u03b1 promoter. We first cloned a \u201cPSD95-GFP-IRES-DsRed\u201d into pENTR2B vector (Invitrogen). Infective viri were then prepared by TranzVector (Tranzyme). Whereas the plasmid also contained a DsRed gene separated by an internal ribosome entry site, DsRed expression was too low in these neurons to use for the  imaging experiments. DsRed could not be detected even in fixed tissue, or with immunohistochemical amplification with streptavidin (data not shown). It remains possible that some dendrites which lack puncta might be missed in our analysis. However, two results argue against a considerable bias. First, dendritic arbors of PSD95-GFP neurons are similar to those of GFP-labeled neurons (see supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Second, we always observed a few dendrites that had cytoplasmic signal with no puncta. In all those cases, the cytoplasmic signal was diffused equally in proximal and distal dendritic endings and never fragmented.For cytosolic GFP labeling, a commercial lentivirus (TranzVector, Tranzyme) containing the gene for GFP and controlled by the Elongation Factor\u20131-\u03b1 promoter was used to transduce adult-born neurons. Virus titers were >108 transducing Us/ml.Lentivirus injections into the SVZ and imaging were performed as described earlier (Mizrahi, 2007). Mice were anesthetized by ketamine/xylazine (0.1 mg per g of body weight, i.p.). Additional anesthesia (1% isoflurane in O2, by inhalation) was supplied as needed. Injections were done stereotaxically using pressure (coordinates relative to Bregma: anterior-1 mm, lateral-1 mm, depth 2.2 mm; anterior-0 mm, lateral-1.4 mm, depth 1.6 mm). Each mouse received a single or a double injection on the left and/or right SVZ (estimated injection volume is \u223c0.5 \u03bcl). The approximate success rate in lentivirus injections was \u223c70% (40/57 mice, used for  imaging, fixed tissue analysis and TEM; see above). The total number of labeled neurons (GCs + PGNs) varied between injections but always resulted in much larger numbers of GCs compared with PGNs. We limited our  experiments to nonspiny PGNs. In a few cases we also identified spiny neurons at the GL but these neurons were not studied in this work. A 0.1 g metal bar was glued to the skull for repositioning the animal's head under the microscope in consecutive imaging sessions (Mizrahi and Katz, 2003). After surgery, mice fully recovered and returned to the animal facility under normal housing conditions until imaging. The 12\u201357 day postinjection (d.p.i.) mice were taken for imaging. Imaging was performed in anesthetized freely breathing mice usually through thinned skull. We normally performed imaging via thinned bone because it proved more reliable for reidentification of the same synaptic puncta on consecutive imaging sessions. However, because imaging via thinned bone is limiting the depth of high contrast imaging, we also used craniotomies when cells were located in the deep glomerular layer (GL). We did not observe any significant differences in structural dynamics between imaging via thinned bone compared with imaging via a craniotomy [data not shown, but see (Xu et al., 2007) for longer imaging intervals].Imaging was performed on an Ultima microscope (Prairie Technologies) equipped with a 40\u00d7 (0.8 NA) IR\u2013Achroplan water-immersion objective (Olympus). A femtosecond laser (Mai\u2013Tai, Spectra Physics) was used to excite GFP at 900 nm. Images (512 \u00d7 512 pixels) were acquired at 0.25 \u03bcm/pixel resolution in the XY dimension and 0.9 \u03bcm steps in the Z dimension.Reconstructions were performed strictly on the raw data images. Reconstructions were performed manually from the complete three dimensional image stacks using Neurolucida (MicrobrightField). Quantitative parameters included the number of branch points per tree, total dendritic branch length (TDBL), number of puncta per cell and Sholl analysis (Sholl, 1953). A dendritic segment was defined as the part of a dendrite between two intersections, between an intersection and an ending, or a retracted part longer than 1 \u03bcm (see below). For dendritic dynamics, only segments longer than 1 \u03bcm were analyzed. Retracted dendritic segments were defined as being present in one imaging session, but not in the next imaging session. Stable dendritic segments were defined as being present in both imaging sessions. For puncta dynamics, only dendritic segments that remained stable in consecutive imaging sessions were analyzed. For display purpose only, image stacks were filtered (median filter), projected as maximum intensity projections or SD projections, and adjusted for contrast and brightness using ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Merged images from time-lapse series were aligned in ImageJ using the turboreg plugin (http://bigwww.epfl.ch/thevenaz/turboreg/). Reconstruction reliability between two different independent reconstructers was 92.3%; reconstruction reliability between two reconstructions of the same reconstructer was 95.7%.To validate that short imaging intervals do not hold substantial dynamics, we performed imaging experiments in time scale of minutes (see supplemental Fig. 6, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Puncta and dendrites were generally stable with relatively few \u201cnew\u201d and \u201clost\u201d puncta or dendrites ( = 3 neurons). Furthermore, these experiments show that lost puncta are not simply puncta that underwent photobleaching, because almost all puncta were stable even during six imaging sessions, \u223c20 min apart. We did not further investigate these short time scales for two reasons. First, mice under these conditions are continuously anesthetized during imaging, which may disrupt normal cytoskeletal dynamics. Second, our data show that a 12 h imaging interval is an adequate interval to study structural dynamics (see main text).To obtain OB slices, mice were perfused transcardially with 0.9% saline followed by 4% formaldehyde and the brain was cryoprotected in 30% sucrose. OBs were sectioned coronally on a sliding microtome (40 \u03bcm slices), washed in PBS and blocked for 1 h in 5% normal goat serum and 0.3% Triton-X. Slices were incubated overnight with a primary antibody (in the blocking solution), washed in PBS, and then incubated for 3 h with a secondary antibody (in the blocking solution). Slices were then washed and mounted on microscope slides. The primary antibody used was mouse anti-VGLUT2 (1:500) from Millipore. The secondary antibody used was anti-mouse Cy5 (1:200) from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Confocal images were obtained using an Olympus FV-1000 confocal microscope.Analysis, of PSD95-GFP puncta apposition to VGLUT2 labeling, was performed on complete three dimensional image stacks. Puncta were considered to be opposed to VGLUT2 labeling if they exhibited fluorescent colocalization (yellow instead of green) (see Fig. 2), and were encompassed by VGLUT2 in all dimensions (, , and ).All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (SPSS). Nonparametric tests were used for small samples (Kruskal\u2013Wallis test followed by Mann\u2013Whitney test), whereas the Student's  test was used for larger samples. Significances were accepted at  = 0.05, except when the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was applied.Intrinsic signal imaging (ISI) of the dorsal surface of the bulb was performed using an Imager 3001 (Optical Imaging) via thinned bone. Before each experiment, the surface blood vessel pattern was acquired under green light illumination (546 nm). Light reflectance from the surface of the OB (630 nm wavelength light illumination) was captured using a CCD camera (Dalsa 1M60P). Images were acquired with a spatial resolution of \u223c20 \u03bcm/pixel (full frames were 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixels and binned (3 \u00d7 3) for analysis). IS maps were analyzed off-line, using a Matlab-based software which was developed and kindly provided to us by H. Spors (Max Planck Institute of Biophysics, Frankfurt, Geremany). IS maps were created by subtracting the averaged response to pure oxygen from the averaged response to the odorants. Odorants were presented using a custom-made olfactometer (stimulus duration, 4 s). Odor stimuli were composed of a methylbenzoate and butanal mixture (1:1, >99% purity, 10 ppm each diluted in mineral oil) and resulted in activation of several overlapping glomeruli. The surface blood vessel pattern was later used to align intrinsic signal images with two-photon images as described previously (Mizrahi and Katz, 2003).ISI images were first analyzed in a course manner (by signal threshold) to designate active or nonactive areas for reference during two-photon imaging (see Fig. 5). A more detailed analysis was used at the exact location of all the imaged PGNs. Specifically, each PGN location was examined based on its time course and signal strength. Active areas exhibited a time course that was locked to the stimulus onset and showed a decrease in intrinsic signal (>2 \u00d7 10\u22124). Nonactive areas did not meet both conditions.Odor-enriched mice were housed in their home cages with an \u201codor pot\u201d hanging from the top of the cage. This odor pot contained 150 \u03bcl of 20 ppm odor mixture (methylbenzoate and butanal, 1:1 diluted in mineral oil) on a swab. The swab was replaced approximately every 24 h. The smell of a freshly made odor pot was barely noticeable by us or other members of our lab. As a further control experiment, we verified that the ISI odor mapping by itself did not cause the morphological effect (supplemental Fig. 7, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).Mice were perfused transcardially using 300 ml of 0.25% glutaraldehyde and 2% formaldehyde in 0.1 m PB, pH 7.4 at room temperature (RT), at a rate of 10 ml/min. OBs were dissected out and first cut into 60 \u03bcm coronal slices using a vibratome (Leica VT100). Vibratome sections were screened for labeled PGNs using standard fluorescent microscopy. Once the labeled PGNs were located, the slices were aligned and photographed (using a still camera), and a region corresponding to \u223c5 glomeruli was then isolated for further targeting of the cells. Isolated regions, normally containing one labeled PGN, were then processed for TEM separately.To abolish endogenous peroxidases, the sections were incubated for 10 min in 0.015% H2O2 (in PBS). Sections were cryoprotected in a solution of 15% sucrose/5% glycerol in PBS for 20 min in RT and then in a solution of 30% sucrose 10% glycerol in PBS in 4\u00b0C, overnight. Then, sections were frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane, followed by liquid nitrogen and thawed in PBS. For immunolabeling, the sections were incubated in a blocking solution containing 5% normal rabbit serum (NRS), 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.5% glycine, 0.5% lysine, 0.01% Triton X-100 and 0.13% sodium azide in PBS for 1 h (at RT). Slices were incubated overnight in an anti-GFP primary antibody (chicken anti-GFP 1:600, Millipore) in 2% NRS and 0.01% Triton X-100 in PBS, and then with a biotinylated secondary antibody (1:500 rabbit anti-chicken F(ab\u2032)2 fragment, The Jackson Laboratory). Labeling was revealed using the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (ABC Elite, Vector Laboratories) and 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine tetrachloride. The reaction product was intensified and substituted with silver/gold particles as described by others (Belenky et al., 2003). Briefly, slices were incubated for 10 min at 60\u00b0C in a solution containing 2.6% hexamethylene tetramine, 0.2% AgNO3, and 0.2% Borax, washed in 2% sodium acetate and incubated for 5 min in 0.05% HAuCl4 at RT, washed in 2% sodium acetate and then incubated for 5 min in 3% Na2SO3 at RT. The sections were then postfixed with 1% osmic acid and 1.5% potassium ferricyanide in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, for 1 h in RT, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol (30\u2013100%) and embedded in increasing concentrations (50\u2013100%) of Agar 100 resin (Agar Scientific). Once cured in a 60\u00b0C oven for 48 h, ultrathin sections of the region, in which a labeled PGN was located, were sectioned using an LKB-3 ultramicrotome, collected onto thin bar 200# cuprum grids, and then stained with saturated aqueous uranyl acetate and lead citrate solutions. Control sections were processed as described above except that the primary antibody was omitted. Control sections had no specific staining. Ultrathin sections were observed with a Tecnai 12 (Phillips) TEM equipped with MegaView II CCD camera and AnalySIS version 3.0 software (SoftImaging System). Slices from one mouse were processed as described, but without the intensification and substitution with silver/gold particles. These slices were used as a control to verify that the intensification and substitution with silver/gold particles did not cause any alterations in the tissue.Mice were perfused transcardially using 300 ml of 0.25% glutaraldehyde and 2% formaldehyde in 0.1 m PB, pH 7.4, or 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 m PB, pH 7.4 at room temperature (RT), at a rate of 10 ml/min. OBs were dissected out and first cut into 60 or 400 \u03bcm coronal slices using a vibratome (Leica VT100).Cortex sections of YFP mice were then dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and embedded in LRWhite (London Resin), as previously described (Micheva and Smith, 2007). In OB sections, this process greatly reduced the fluorescence and so we performed a more moderate dehydration process. OB Slices were dehydrated in a different graded series of ethanol (30\u201370%) and then embedded in 100% LRWhite. Once cured in a 50\u00b0C oven for 24 h, fluorescence was examined in the LR-White block (supplemental Fig. 1,, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Ultrathin sections of the region, in which labeled neurons were located, were thin-sectioned, collected onto formvar-coated 200# nickel grids, and processed for postembedding immunolabeling. Grids were incubated in drops of reagent on Parafilm within a wet chamber and the various steps alternated with washes in drops of Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 20 mm Tris-base, 0.9% NaCl, 0.5% BSA, 0.5% Tween 20 and 0.13% NaN3, pH 8.2. This was followed by 1 h incubation in a blocker containing 5% normal goat serum (NGS) in TBS and incubation either for a few hours or overnight with the primary antibody (chicken anti-GFP 1:100; Millipore). After that, grids were incubated for 90 min with a 12 nm gold-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10 donkey anti-chicken, The Jackson Laboratory), and then washed in TBS. Sections were then stained with saturated aqueous uranyl acetate and lead citrate solutions. Control sections were processed as described above except that the primary antibody was omitted. Control sections had no specific staining.Our experimental strategy for labeling synapses of adult-born neurons was to express a GFP-tagged postsynaptic protein. We chose the postsynaptic density scaffold protein, PSD95, which is largely restricted to synapses and is a commonly used postsynaptic marker  and  (Washbourne et al., 2002; Ebihara et al., 2003; Niell et al., 2004). We used a lentivirus (\u201clenti-PSD95-GFP\u201d) injected into the subventricular zone (SVZ) as the transducing system to selectively label adult-born neurons and synapses (Fig. 1). A single virus injection (\u223c0.5 \u03bcl) typically labeled hundreds of neuronal progenitors which migrated into the OB. We focused our study on two experimental age groups. One age group was \u201cimmature\u201d neurons (12\u201314 d.p.i.) corresponding to \u201cstage 4\u201d neurons (Petreanu and Alvarez-Buylla, 2002). This age group was chosen because it is known to be within a developmental phase in which synaptogenesis is at its peak (Belluzzi et al., 2003; Carleton et al., 2003; Whitman and Greer, 2007a). The second age group was \u201cmature\u201d adult-born neurons (40\u201360 d.p.i.), corresponding to fully integrated neurons.Targeting synapses of adult-born neurons using lenti-PSD95-GFP. , Schematic representation of the mouse brain and the experimental protocol.

All images are projections. Scale bars: (, , ) 20 \u03bcm; (, ) 10 \u03bcm.At 12\u201314 d.p.i., labeled adult-born neurons were located throughout the OB. Neuronal progenitors were located in the rostral migratory stream (RMS) and had the morphology of migrating neuroblasts (i.e., elongated cell body with a leading neurite) with a diffuse fluorescent signal throughout their cytosol (Fig. 1). Outside the RMS, neurons were scattered in the granule cell layer (GCL) and the glomerular layer (GL). In the GL, most neurons were periglomerular neurons (PGNs) extending dendritic trees into the immediate glomerular neuropile. PGN dendrites were studded with punctuate fluorescent signals corresponding to the PSD95-GFP protein aggregations (Fig. 1). In the GCL, neurons had classical granule cell morphology. Fluorescent signal was scattered throughout the neurons with more intense PSD95-GFP signal within spine heads in the external plexiform layer (EPL) (Fig. 1). At \u223c40 d.p.i., adult born neurons were largely devoid of the RMS and restricted to the GCL and GL. Mature PGNs and GCs had a dendritic morphology similar to that we and others have described previously (Mizrahi, 2007; Whitman and Greer, 2007b). Examples of a mature PGN and a spiny dendrite from a mature GC, both expressing PSD95-GFP, are shown in Figure 1,  and , respectively. In all neurons, dendritic trees appeared as pale backbones compared with the fluorescence of the PSD95-GFP puncta. Although the vast majority of the labeled neurons were GCs, here we focused on the PGNs because they synapse locally in defined functional-anatomical units (i.e., the glomeruli), and their superficial location makes them more accessible for  imaging.Can PSD95-GFP puncta in PGN dendrites be used as proxy for synapses? Several results indicate that they can. First, to correlate between the fluorescent signal and actual synapses, we used immuno-transmission electron microscopy (TEM). PSD95-GFP fluorescence was identified in coronal slices at low magnification. We then isolated a region corresponding to \u223c5 glomeruli and processed it for TEM with antibodies targeted to GFP (Fig. 2). As expected from the highly sparse labeling, we had to screen hundreds of ultrathin sections to reveal a labeled synapse. However, once found, it provided unequivocal evidence that some puncta are indeed synapses. As depicted in Figure 2, anti-GFP labeling appeared as an electron-dense grainy aggregate, mainly confined to the PSD (see more examples in supplemental Fig. 5, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Second, to further validate this finding we used a different immuno-TEM approach, which requires less tissue processing and has advantages for immunostaining (Micheva and Smith, 2007). As expected, we found GFP immuno-staining confined to synapses in the EPL and GL (supplemental text and supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Third, we performed immuno-staining against Vesicular Glutamate Transporter 2 (VGLUT2), one of the presynaptic markers in the glomerular layer, specific to olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs; Gabellec et al., 2007). In almost all examined neurons (10/11 immature neurons from 3 mice, and 10/10 mature neurons from 3 mice) a significant fraction of PSD95-GFP puncta appeared in close apposition to the VGLUT2 labeling (Fig. 2). Quantification of these appositions in mature neurons showed that almost one-half of their postsynaptic puncta were opposed to this presynaptic marker (46 \u00b1 4%). Whereas appositions with VGLUT2 labeling represent only a subset of putative synapses (i.e., others being dendrodendritic synapses with Mitral and Tufted cells), it further demonstrates \u201ccorrect\u201d synaptic appositions of the PSD95-GFP signal. Finally, in spiny GCs, the PSD95-GFP signal is localized in spine heads; and, spines are good proxies for synapses (Knott et al., 2006). Together, we conclude that PSD95-GFP puncta serve as good proxy for putative synapses,  (Niell et al., 2004).PSD95-GFP puncta as proxy for synapses. , , Targeting of PSD95-GFP-expressing PGNs for TEM analysis. , PSD95-GFP-labeled PGNs (circled in ) were located in a fluorescent microscope under low resolution.

Not all puncta were opposed to this presynaptic marker (green; arrowheads). Scale bar, 20 \u03bcm.To rule out the possibility that transgene expression impedes normal development, we exhausted a comparison between GFP-expressing neurons and PSD95-GFP-expressing neurons and found them to be similar in all the analyses we have performed. Specifically, GFP and PSD95-GFP neurons had similar dendritic morphologies, a similar morphological maturation pattern, and similar GC spine densities (corresponding to synaptic density; see supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). PSD95-GFP expression did not seem to affect the life span of adult-born neurons because these could be even found 8\u20139 months after injection (supplemental Fig. 2,, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). These control experiments clearly show that expressing PSD95-GFP using lentivirus transduction does not considerably impede PGNs morphology, maturation, synaptic density, nor does it affect life longevity. Having established a method to tag putative synapses , we next followed the developmental dynamics of PSD95-GFP puncta by time-lapse  two-photon imaging of immature and mature PGNs.We imaged PSD95-GFP puncta of adult-born PGNs in anesthetized, freely breathing mice.  two-photon imaging revealed high contrast, high resolution images of both dendrites and puncta (Figs. 1, 3\u21d3\u21d3\u20136). An example of a complete -stack of a PGN from a single  imaging session is shown in supplemental Movie 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material.PSD95-GFP dynamics of immature adult-born PGNs at different imaging intervals. , Projection images from consecutive  imaging sessions 24 h apart (, ) and 12 h apart. , , Examples of stable, lost, and new puncta are marked with green, red and blue arrows, respectively (same neuron as in supplemental Movie 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). , Quantitative analysis of puncta dynamics, at different imaging intervals. For clarity, only the percentage of stable puncta (out of the total number) is shown. Full range is indicated by the dashed lines, open circles indicate means ( = 11 neurons, from 6 mice). Isolated points (not connected to a line) are from neurons which were only imaged twice. Lines connect consecutive sessions from the same neuron. For example, the red line shows data of the neuron in , which was imaged four times. The percentage of stable, new, and lost puncta were not significantly different between all imaging intervals (Kruskal\u2013Wallis test; stable puncta:  = 0.32, lost puncta:  = 0.38, new puncta:  = 0.35). Neurons imaged at 12, 13 or 14 d.p.i. had similar values of stable, lost, and new puncta. All values are mean \u00b1 SEM. Scale bars, 20 \u03bcm.One advantage of using  two-photon imaging is the ability to study structural dynamics over time. Indeed, multiple imaging sessions for long durations can reveal temporal dynamics at multiple time scales (Holtmaat et al., 2005). However, multiple imaging sessions suffer from increased likelihood to cause photodynamic damage, and long imaging intervals may result in uncontrolled effects in the underlying tissue. Therefore, we looked for the shortest imaging interval in which significant puncta dynamics occurred, and could be revealed using only two imaging sessions. We performed time-lapse imaging of 11 neurons in a total of 32 imaging sessions ( = 6 mice), ranging from four sessions at 24 h intervals down to two sessions at 12 h intervals (Fig. 3). As expected from immature neurons, both dendrites and puncta were highly dynamic. We never observed a completely stable neuron.Puncta dynamics were analyzed on stable dendrites from consecutive imaging sessions. For example, Figure 3, A\u2013D, shows neurons that were imaged 2\u20134 times at 12 or 24 h intervals. Each puncta was scored as either stable, new, or lost (see examples in Fig. 3; green, blue and red arrows, respectively). At this immature developmental stage only 36\u201367% of PSD95-GFP puncta per neuron remained stable in consecutive imaging sessions (Fig. 3, dashed lines) and the rest were either new or lost (for clarity, only data of stable puncta are shown in Fig. 3). Stability was similar in 12, 24, 48 and 72 h imaging intervals. For example, during 72 h between imaging sessions, 52 \u00b1 6% (mean \u00b1 SEM) of PSD95-GFP puncta were stable (Fig. 3, 0\u201372, open circle) ( = 3), and during 12 h between imaging sessions 53 \u00b1 4% were stable (Fig. 3, 0\u201312, open circle) ( = 7). These values were not significantly different across all imaging intervals tested (0\u201312, 0\u201324, 0\u201348 and 0\u201372 h; Kruskal\u2013Wallis Test,  = 0.32). However, as expected, when examining different imaging intervals of the same neuron, stability usually decreased with increasing imaging intervals (6/7 neurons) (Fig. 3, lines). Thus, PSD95-GFP puncta of immature neurons are in a highly dynamic state which can be revealed during a 12 h period; an interval which we continued to use throughout this study. We next asked whether synapses of mature neurons also remain dynamic. To answer this question, we analyzed mature (\u223c40 d.p.i.) neurons by time-lapse imaging.We hypothesized that PSD95-GFP puncta of mature neurons would remain dynamic because recent work by our group demonstrated significant levels of dendritic dynamics in these cells (Mizrahi, 2007). To test this issue, we imaged mature PGNs (\u223c40 d.p.i.) at 12 h intervals and compared their morphology and dynamics to those of immature PGNs (Fig. 4,). Compared with immature neurons, mature PGNs had a higher total dendritic branch length (TDBL), more branch points, and twice the number of puncta per neuron (Fig. 4). In both mature and immature PGNs the average distance between PSD95-GFP puncta along dendrites remained similar, indicating that synapses and dendrites grow in parallel, at least up to this age (immature: 5.6 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcm; mature: 5.4 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcm;  test,  = 0.22).Maturation of adult-born PGNs: morphology and puncta dynamics. , Time-lapse images of a mature adult-born PGN (42 d.p.i.).

Mature PGNs had significantly more stable puncta and significantly less new puncta. Furthermore, immature PGNs had a significantly higher percentage of new puncta than lost. In contrast, mature PGNs had a similar percentage of new and lost puncta.  = 7 immature PGNs from 4 mice, and 5 mature PGNs from 3 mice. All values are mean \u00b1 SEM * < 0.04, ** < 0.005, *** < 0.001 (Mann\u2013Whitney test).The dynamic behavior of mature and immature PGNs was also different. Specifically, mature PGNs had 25% more stable puncta (i.e., \u223c75% of total) and 50% less new puncta (i.e., \u223c13% of total) compared with immature PGNs (Fig. 4). Thus, as adult-born neurons matured, PSD95-GFP puncta became more stable. Despite the higher stability, PSD95-GFP puncta still remained highly dynamic suggesting that PGNs continuously form and eliminate synapses, not only during early development but well after they have integrated into the network. We next tested whether local sensory input might play a role in the early development of adult-born PGN dendrites and synapses.Little is currently known about the mechanisms that determine developmental choices of adult-born neurons. Mechanisms of cell fate decisions are intracellular in nature and might already be determined during migration or even at the stem cell niche (Hack et al., 2005; Waclaw et al., 2006; Merkle et al., 2007). However, after neuronal fate is determined and neurons reach their target zone, what mechanisms guide their developmental and integration strategies? Driven by the observation of the high-levels of puncta dynamics (Fig. 3), we hypothesized that synaptogenesis within glomeruli is continuously regulated. One mechanism that might serve as a regulator of synaptogenesis is sensory input. PGNs are located perfectly to test this hypothesis because their dendrites are compactly arranged within glomeruli, which receive functionally homogeneous synaptic input from highly convergent axonal projections. To test this hypothesis, we combined intrinsic signal imaging (ISI) with  two-photon imaging of immature PGNs.The experimental design is schematically outlined in Figure 5. For each mouse, we constructed an odor map of the dorsal surface of the OB using ISI (Fig. 5). We used an odor composed of a low-concentration mixture of butanal and methylbenzoate (1:1; 10 ppm each) which activated numerous glomeruli in the mediolateral region of the dorsal surface (Fig. 5). After odor maps were constructed, mice were immediately injected with lenti-PSD95-GFP in the SVZ and then returned to their home cages. Three to four days after injection mice were exposed to a small odor pot containing low quantities of the odor mixture (150 \u03bcl on a swab). Odor pots were placed in the home cage, replaced daily, and maintained until the end of the experiment (from 3\u20134 to 12\u201314 d.p.i.). We imaged a total of 17 PGNs ( = 10 mice), 9 of which were located in IS-active (enriched) domains and 8 in IS-nonactive (nonenriched) domains. A neuron was considered \u201cwithin\u201d an IS-active domain if its domain obeyed both threshold and temporal dynamics criteria of the ISI signal (see Materials and Methods and Fig. 5 for an example). PGNs outside sensory active domains were at least 0.5 mm away from the closest active glomerulus. In a separate control experiment we verified that the IS maps remained stable before and after enrichment, precluding the possibility of major physiological changes in ORN input to PGNs (supplemental Fig. 3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).Local sensory input upregulates adult-born PGN development. , Schematic representation of the experimental protocol (top) and time course of the ISI-targeted 2P imaging experiment (bottom).

The lower values of neurons from nonenriched domains were similar to those of immature neurons from naive mice (dashed gray bars and lines).  = 9 PGNs in enriched domains and  = 8 PGNs in nonenriched domains.

All values are mean \u00b1 SEM, * < 0.001 (Kruskal\u2013Wallis test, followed by Mann\u2013Whitney test). Imm.-naive, Immature PGNs from naive mice; mat.-naive, mature PGNs from naive mice; imm.-enrich., immature PGNs from enriched domains in enriched mice; imm.-nonenrich., immature PGNs from nonenriched domains in enriched mice.A standard morphological analysis revealed that PGNs growing within sensory enriched loci were almost twice as large compared with PGNs in the nonenriched loci (Fig. 5). This striking increase was evident in all tested morphological parameters such as TDBL, number of branch points, as well as in the number of puncta per neuron and the neurons' spatial territory coverage (i.e., Sholl analysis) (Fig. 5; compare black and white bars and full lines). Moreover, sensory enrichment upregulated the morphology of enriched PGNs well out of the range of normal, immature, PGNs (Fig. 5). Reconstructions of all the neurons from the enrichment experiments are shown in supplemental Figure 4, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material. Interestingly, the morphological complexity of enriched neurons was upregulated to level of \u201cmature\u201d cells. We could not distinguish \u201cenriched\u201d (immature) PGNs from mature PGNs nor nonenriched from immature PGNs in naive mice (Fig. 5; data from naive mice is shown again for comparison and is the same as in Fig. 4, dashed gray bars and lines). Thus, sensory enrichment locally upregulated the morphology of immature PGNs to levels of mature PGNs.The pronounced increase in morphological complexity of enriched immature neurons, to the level of mature neurons, was evident by basic morphological analyses. However, to test whether enrichment changed their dynamics, we used time-lapse imaging. Dynamics during a 12 h interval was tested in 6 neurons, which were located within enriched domains. Time-lapse data from these cells was compared with the data collected in naive mice from both immature and mature PGNs (same dataset shown Fig. 4). Examples of time-lapse sequences from the three different groups are shown in Figure 6. Although enriched neurons had the morphological complexity of mature neurons, they still showed dynamic behavior reminiscent of immature PGNs. Specifically, the percentage of stable puncta in enriched neurons was significantly smaller than that of mature PGNs from naive mice, and not significantly different from that of immature PGNs from naive mice (Fig. 6). This result suggests that sensory enrichment does not simply accelerate the normal growth pattern of adult-born PGNs.Dynamics of odor-enriched adult-born PGNs compared with immature and mature adult-born PGNs. , Images of PSD95-GFP puncta from 12 h time-lapse sequences, .

Note that data of puncta dynamics of immature and mature neurons from naive mice is the same as in Figure 4 (dotted bars). Scale bars, 10 \u03bcm. Imm.-naive, Immature PGNs from naive mice; mat.-naive, mature PGNs from naive mice; imm.-enrich., immature PGNs from enriched domains in enriched mice.Another hallmark of immature neuronal dynamics is that they had significantly more new puncta than lost puncta; a difference which was no longer evident at maturity (Fig. 4). The larger fraction of new puncta indicates that immature PGNs are in a process of overall growth. In this respect, enriched PGNs resembled mature neurons because the levels of new and lost puncta were also not significantly different (Fig. 6). Thus, on one hand, enrichment accelerated the development of immature PGNs such that the overall number of potential synapses grew, but overall growth stopped. However, enrichment did not change the overall structural stability of the PGNs indicating that neuronal age rather than size sets the levels of structural plasticity.We describe a system for imaging putative synapses of adult-born PGNs, . Using time-lapse two-photon imaging, we showed that synaptic puncta are dynamic, suggesting that synaptogenesis is continuously regulated. Using a combined structural and functional imaging approach we showed that development of adult-born PGNs is locally upregulated by sensory activity.Neuroblasts from the SVZ migrate through the RMS and into the OB where they become fully functional interneurons. The fate of new neurons is already determined at the SVZ by their birth place and not by the host environment (Kelsch et al., 2007; Merkle et al., 2007). Moreover, the distinct location within the SVZ will determine the expression pattern of specific transcription factors (TFs), which in turn determine neuronal fate (Hack et al., 2005; Waclaw et al., 2006). If \u201cfate\u201d is depicted as the anatomical location and immunocytochemical characterization of the cell, then the PGNs that we described were already fated. However, once fated and in place, what shapes PGNs' local growth, synaptic integration and connectivity pattern formation? Our data show that one regulator is sensory input.Sensory input has been classically recognized as important in shaping development and plasticity throughout the nervous system (Katz and Shatz, 1996; Sanes and Lichtman, 2001; Nithianantharajah and Hannan, 2006). In the mouse OB, sensory input has been studied during development and in adulthood by a variety of manipulations ranging from odor deprivation to genetic silencing of ORNs (Brunjes, 1994; Zhao and Reed, 2001). Sensory input plays a regulatory role during initial wiring of the glomeruli (Kerr and Belluscio, 2006) as well as in competitive interactions between ORNs as they re-innervate existing glomeruli in adulthood (Zheng et al., 2000). The majority of activity-dependent manipulations are based on substantial perturbation of the system, leading to compensatory responses in the existing circuitry. For example, nostril occlusion during postnatal development not only affected the survival and morphology of adult-born GCs, but also triggered compensatory responses in resident GCs (Saghatelyan et al., 2005).In previous work by our group we also used unilateral nostril occlusion in adults and found no significant effects on dendritic morphology and dynamics of adult-born PGNs, after short deprivation periods (Mizrahi, 2007). Those data suggested that naturally occurring spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity of ORNs does not play a significant role in early stages of the development of those PGNs. Indeed, naturally occurring sensory-evoked activity of ORNs, in naive animals, may vary considerably and is thus difficult to control experimentally. In this work, we considerably improved our control over the sensory manipulations by targeting active glomeruli which responded to odor presentation, and nonactive regions which did not. Simple odor exposure significantly upregulated morphological development and synaptogenesis of PGNs, only in sensory enriched glomeruli, and not in others. Although our results were significant across animals, the strongest evidence comes from neurons growing in the same tissue, some of which were separated only by several hundred micrometers (Fig. 5).Our data suggest that local sensory input induces an increase in the numbers of potential synapses during the time of integration into the network. Although the nature of the extra synapses is not known, comparison of the dynamics in enriched PGNs vs immature and mature PGNs reveals some insight about the effects of the sensory enrichment. On one hand, enrichment induced more puncta and caused net growth to cease, similar to mature PGNs. One the other hand, the overall puncta population was not as stable as in mature PGNs (this is schematically shown in Fig. 7). We propose a model in which the age of the neuron (enriched or not) determines its dynamic state, but the overall neuron size and number of synapses have an upper bound limit.Schematic model of the developmental upregulation induced by sensory enrichment. , Under animal facility conditions, most glomeruli will not be robustly activated by the odor environment of the animal (notice only few active ORNs). Under these conditions, adult-born PGNs gradually grow and stabilize while they integrate into the network. , Sensory input will induce highly robust neuronal activity from ORNs in select glomeruli. Under these conditions, dendritic and synaptic dynamics are changed resulting in an increase of the total numbers of dendrites and synapses. See Discussion.Our dataset is limited to postsynaptic dynamics. These postsynaptic dynamics might also reflect presynaptic dynamics of the PGNs' presynaptic partners (i.e., ORNs, Mitral/Tufted Cells, and possibly centrifugal inputs). This is especially relevant to ORN inputs, which continuously turnover in the olfactory epithelium throughout life. Thus, as ORN axons constantly break and form synaptic connections they are expected to influence the postsynaptic dynamics of adult-born PGNs as well. In contrast, Mitral cells have been shown to be structurally stable over long periods (Mizrahi and Katz, 2003), and should have a minor affect on postsynaptic PGN dynamics compared with ORN axons. Whether stabilization of synapses is effected by the age and structural stability of its presynaptic partner is not known but it is clear that adult-born neurons can form synapses with preexisting presynapses within the circuit (Toni et al., 2007).The cellular mechanism by which sensory enrichment works might be via increasing stability of newborn synapses and thereby causing the neuron to lose less synapses. Consequently, this increase in the number of synapses, may promote an increased growth or stabilization of new dendrites (Cline and Haas, 2008). Alternatively, sensory enrichment may promote increased dendritic growth (concomitant with synapse formation on new dendrites); thereby increasing the total amount of stable, new and lost synapses, while keeping the overall turnover rate constant. Either mechanism might be achieved by means of direct synaptic activity, but perhaps also by activity-dependant secretion of neurotrophic factors by ORN axons, similar to the regulation of axonal competition within glomeruli (Cao et al., 2007). Data from the hippocampus, showed that molecular components like GABA and NMDA receptors play a role in activity-dependent regulation during synaptic integration of adult-born neurons (Ge et al., 2006; Tashiro et al., 2006), a mechanism which might well be shared by adult-born neurons in the OB.Behaviorally induced plasticity in the mammalian OB was addressed with respect to survival rates of adult-born neurons (Rochefort et al., 2002; Magavi et al., 2005; Alonso et al., 2006). Alonso et al. (2006) showed that survival rates do not change after mere sensory activation, but only after learning. Although we did not study survival rates, our data show that mere local sensory activation does increase synaptogenesis. It is difficult to directly compare the results between the studies because different methods have been used to detect sensory active regions. We used ISI whereas others used immunohistochemistry of immediate early genes and genetic targeting as proxy for locating sensory active domains. Both strategies have advantages and disadvantages and it would be interesting to investigate whether and how learning-induced activation shapes the different stages of adult neurogenesis using ISI as the targeting approach. Notably, we did not use odor exposure in a specific behavioral context. Rather, we used simple odor exposure to promote local activation in the OB. Whether and how different levels of odor stimulation will affect adult-born development remains to be seen. In simpler systems like , it has been recently proposed that the local olfactory interneurons (corresponding to the mammalian OB interneurons) may be the basis for experience-dependent plasticity, induced by prolonged exposure to an odorant (Sachse et al., 2007).Adult neurogenesis has been largely studied at the level of proliferation, migration, and survival but much less is known about synaptic integration and consequent connectivity patterns (Lledo et al., 2006; Toni et al., 2007; Whitman and Greer, 2007a). Specifically, who are the presynaptic partners impinging on the adult-born PGNs? And in turn, which neurons receive input from the PGNs? Although the latter question remains completely open, the former question has been partially addressed. For example, patch clamp recordings from adult-born PGNs showed the existence of ORN\u2192PGN synapses (Belluzzi et al., 2003; Grubb et al., 2008). In accordance with these data, in targeted EM screens we always (14/14 PGNs, 8.7 \u00b1 1.3 synapses from each PGN) found ORN\u2192PGN synapses (see supplemental Fig. 5, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Furthermore, almost all adult-born PGNs examined with light microscopy, had PSD95-GFP puncta within ORN-zones (20/21) (Fig. 2), supporting the presence of an ORN\u2192PGN synapse in adult-born PGNs.This connectivity pattern suggests that the adult-born PGNs that we studied here might be \u201ctype I\u201d neurons as determined by current nomenclature, based on synaptic connectivity and immunocytochemical markers (Kosaka and Kosaka, 2007). However, further immunocytochemical analysis is needed to verify this. One reservation from this interpretation concerns possible variability resulting from the variability of injection sites between different studies (Merkle et al., 2007) and species and strain-specificity (Kosaka and Kosaka, 2007). In rats, ORN\u2192PGN synapse is the exception rather the rule (Hayar et al., 2004; Wachowiak and Shipley, 2006). In addition, EM data from BALB/C mice (the strain used here), found no evidence for ORN\u2192PGN synapses (White, 1972, 1973). The rarity of ORN\u2192PGN synapses in general sampling techniques versus their abundance in targeted analyses from different injection sites (Belluzzi et al., 2003; Grubb et al., 2008) suggests that this synapse might hold special importance for adult-born PGNs.This work was supported by Israeli Science Foundation Grant #313-05 to A.M.

The loss of MOCA in mice leads to axonal degeneration and causes sensorimotor impairments by decreasing cofilin phosphorylation and altering its upstream signaling partners LIM kinase and p21-activated kinase, an enzyme directly downstream of Rac1. The dystrophic axons found in MOCA-deficient mice are associated with abnormal aggregates of neurofilament protein, the disorganization of the axonal cytoskeleton, and the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles and polyubiquitinated proteins. Furthermore, MOCA deficiency causes an alteration in the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of cofilin-containing rod-like structures. The dystrophic axons show functional abnormalities, including impaired axonal transport. These findings demonstrate that MOCA is required for maintaining the functional integrity of axons and define a model for the steps leading to axonal degeneration.Axonal dystrophy, characterized by swellings and varicosities that interrupt the continuity of axons of dysfunctional or degenerating neurons, is a hallmark of many neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (Medana and Esiri, 2003; Coleman, 2005). Axonal dystrophy also occurs in response to inflammation, metabolic disturbances, myelin disorders, and ischemia (Medana and Esiri, 2003; Coleman, 2005). Axonal swellings often contain aberrant accumulations of axonal cargos such as organelles, vesicles, and cytoskeletal proteins such as neurofilaments (NFs) and microtubules (Chevalier-Larsen and Holzbaur, 2006; Duncan and Goldstein, 2006). Some axonal swellings are filled with autophagic structures resulting from the failure of lysosomal-mediated organelle transport and protein degradation (Nixon, 2006; Rubinsztein, 2006). However, the mechanisms underlying the formation of the axonal pathologies that are shared among many neurological diseases are not well understood.Modifier of cell adhesion (MOCA, DOCK3) was discovered as a presenilin (PS) binding protein (PBP), and is only expressed in neurons and in the testis (Kashiwa et al., 2000). It is a member of DOCK180 family of proteins and functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) (C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Vuori, 2002; Grimsley et al., 2004; Namekata et al., 2004; Meller et al., 2005). Mutations in the human  gene have been linked to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (de Silva et al., 2003). MOCA regulates metabolism of cell adhesion proteins, such as amyloid precursor protein (APP) and cadherin, and is also involved in modulating neurite growth (Chen et al., 2002, 2005). MOCA is found in AD tangles and regulates tau phosphorylation (Chen et al., 2001). In the present study, we generated a  gene knock-out mouse line and demonstrate that the deletion of MOCA leads to a central axonal dystrophy, a concomitant loss of sensorimotor function, and impaired axoplasmic flow, all of which are common to many age-associated neurological diseases. In addition, we demonstrated an alteration of actin dynamics regulated by cofilin and its related kinase pathway that links MOCA to the cytoskeleton network required for axoplasmic function.An affinity-purified polyclonal antibody that recognizes amino acid residues 2012\u20132027 of MOCA was generated in rabbits (Kashiwa et al., 2000). Other antibodies used in the present study include the following: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (catalog #G8795), NF-68 (catalog #N5139) (Sigma-Aldrich); SMI-31 (catalog #SMI-31R), SMI-32 (catalog #SMI-32R) (Covance), APP (22C11, catalog #MAB348), choline acetyltransferase (catalog #AB143), NF-150 (catalog #AB1981), phosphorylated cofilin (catalog #AB3831), GFAP (catalog #AB5804), ubiquitin (catalog #MAB1510) (Millipore), cofilin (612144 from BD Biosciences), mAb 22 (from M. Maloney, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA); phosphorylated cofilin (catalog #3313), LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1) (catalog #3842), phosphorylated LIMK (catalog #3841), p21-activated kinase (PAK)1/2/3 (catalog #2604, Cell Signaling), phosphorylated PAK1/2/3 pSer141 (catalog #44-940G, Invitrogen); and Iba1 (catalog #019-19741, Wako). Fluoro Jade C and Fluoro-Gold (fluorogold) were purchased from Millipore and FluoroChrome, respectively.All procedures for animal studies adhered to the  and were approved by the Salk Institute Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment on a 12 h light/dark cycle with free access to food and water.A  gene knock-out (\u2212/\u2212) targeting vector was made to include a 5\u2032 arm containing a 6 kb dIII-I fragment upstream of exon 2 that was fused in frame to the \u03b2-galactosidase (\u03b2-) gene and a 3\u2032 arm containing a 3.1 kb R I fragment in the downstream of exon 2. A  cassette [used for positive selection of embryonic stem (ES) cells] was placed between the 5\u2032 arm and the 3\u2032 arm, and a  cassette (used for negative selection of ES cells) was placed downstream of the 3\u2032 arm. The resulting construct is shown in supplemental Figure S1A (available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) and is predicted to disrupt most of exon 2 of the  gene as well as its downstream region. Because the \u03b2- gene is fused to the first 24 aa (including those derived from the first exon of the  gene), the expression of \u03b2- gene is driven by the  gene promoter. The targeting construct was introduced via electroporation into ES cells, and homologous recombination was verified by Southern blot analysis (supplemental Fig. S1,, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). The chimeric mice were generated and mated with C57BL/6 mice to produce hemizygous MOCA knock-out (+/\u2212) mice. The hemizygous mice were identified by PCR genotyping and further crossed to each other to produce homozygous \u2212/\u2212 mice (supplemental Fig. S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). \u2212/\u2212 mice were backcrossed with C57BL/6 mice for six generations to produce a mouse line with the same C57BL/6 genetic background. C57BL/6 mice were chosen because this mouse line is most commonly used, and has a relatively known genetic background and an average performance on various behavioral tests. Loss of MOCA expression in the \u2212/\u2212 mice was verified by Western blotting and by the expression of \u03b2-Gal.The rotating rod apparatus (Harvard Apparatus) was used to assess motor performance and measure the ability of mice to improve motor skill performance with training. Mice were placed on the elevated accelerating rod (rotarod, 3 cm in diameter) beginning at 5 rpm/min for four trials per day for three consecutive days. Each trial lasted a maximum of 10 min, during which time the rotating rod underwent a linear acceleration from 4 to 40 rpm over the first 5 min of the trial and then remained at maximum speed for the remaining 5 min. Animals were scored for their latency (in seconds) to fall (height = 20 cm) for each trial. Animals rested a minimum of 10 min between trials to avoid fatigue.The open field test was performed by using MED Associates hardware and the Activity Monitor software according to the manufacturer's instructions (MED Associates). To perform the test, each 2-month-old mouse from either the control or mutant group was placed in the testing chamber, and the activity was tracked by the Activity Monitor software (MED Associates). The time of each testing session was 100 min and the sample interval (the time of each segment) was 5 min. The multiple behavioral parameters were derived from the test, but only the travel distance was analyzed in the present study.The fresh gastrocnemius, gluteal, and triceps muscles from both \u2212/\u2212 and wild-type mice were collected and frozen in isopentane precooled in liquid nitrogen or immersion-fixed in 10% formalin before use. Frozen muscle sections (8-\u03bcm-thick) were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining, and ATPase reactions at pH 9.8 and after preincubation at pH 4.6 and 4.3. The grading system used for statistical purposes was 0 = no abnormalities and 1 = abnormalities observed, such as the presence of internal nuclei, vacuoles, lack of normal striation, glycogen or mitochondrial aggregates, myonecrosis, basophilic or eosinophilic sarcoplasm, fibrosis, and fat accumulation.Sciatic nerves were either processed for paraffin sections or immersion-fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer before processing for plastic sections. L5 dorsal and ventral roots were obtained from animals perfused through the heart with 2.5% phosphate-buffered glutaraldehyde. The vertebral columns were removed and fixed overnight in 2.5% phosphate-buffered glutaraldehyde (4\u00b0C) and roots were dissected out the next day. Sciatic nerves as well as dorsal and ventral roots were postfixed in osmium tetroxide, and dehydrated in serial alcohol solutions and propylene oxide before embedding in Araldite resin. Sections (1 \u03bcm) were stained with toluidine blue acid fuschin or -phenylenediamine for light microscopy.Computer-assisted analyses of myelinated fiber size\u2013frequency distributions were performed on the sciatic nerve and L5 dorsal and ventral roots. For the sciatic nerve of each animal, a single thick section, sampled from the tibial fascicle midway between the sciatic notch and popliteal fossa, was analyzed as described in detail previously (Mizisin et al., 1997). Size\u2013frequency distributions for dorsal and ventral roots were based on single sections from each animal sampled 5 mm proximal to the dorsal root ganglion. Briefly, video images were obtained with an Olympus BH-2 light microscope and attached Cohu 5000 series television camera interfaced with a Hewlett Packard Compaq computer running NIH Image 1.55 software. Using the 40\u00d7 objective, the final magnification of the digitized image was equivalent to 4.05 pixels/\u03bcm. Nonoverlapping fields were sampled by systematic serpentine progression across all fascicles. Myelinated fibers were individually identified and selected before being sorted with an automated process into bins based on axonal diameter.Brains were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 100 mm sodium tetraborate, pH 9.5, for 3 h, cryoprotected with 20% sucrose-potassium-PBS (KPBS), and cryostat sectioned into coronal (30 \u03bcm) sections. Sections were submerged in 0.3% H2O2 for 10 min to eliminate endogenous peroxidase activity and treated with 1% borate to eliminate free paraformaldehyde. Sections were incubated with primary antibody in 0.3% Triton X-100 in KPBS plus 2% filtered serum or BSA overnight at 4\u00b0C, and with secondary antibodies (1:1000) in 0.3% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation with secondary antibody and ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories), sections were developed using metal-enhanced DAB solution. Sections were mounted to slides, dried, dehydrolyzed, treated with xylene, and covered using dibutyl phthalate xylene. For \u03b2-galactosidase histochemistry, sections were further fixed in 10% formalin plus 2 mm MgCl2 for 5 min, rinsed two times with KPBS plus 2 mm MgCl2, and permeabilized in permeabilization buffer (0.01% sodium desoxycholate, 0.02% NP-40, 2 mm MgCl2) for 10 min. Sections were reacted with reaction mix containing 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u03b2-d-galactopyranoside in permeabilization solution overnight at 37\u00b0C. After rinsing in KPBS, sections were mounted to slides, counterstained with neutral red and dehydrated, and covered by coverslips as described above. Images were captured by a Hamamatsu digital camera connected to a Leica Leitz DM IRB microscope, and image analysis on sections was performed using Openlab software (Improvision) or NIH Image software.The cortex from the wild-type and \u2212/\u2212 mice was dissected and dissociated. The cortical cells were placed in poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips and cultured in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27. The neuronal cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS plus 0.25 \u03bcm sucrose for 15 min, washed by PBS, and permeabilized by 0.5% Triton X-100. The fixed cells were blocked in 5% BSA in PBS for 1 h and incubated with primary antibodies followed by fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). The cells were then mounted with antifading media containing 4% -propyl gallate (Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were examined with a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS confocal laser scanning microscope. The images were taken and analyzed by the corresponding software with pixel intensity within a linear range.Subcellular fractionation of spinal cord extracts was performed as described with some modification (Kim et al., 2000; Lah and Levey, 2000; Leem et al., 2002; Gandy et al., 2007). Briefly, 0\u201330% continuous iodixanol gradients were formed in diluent buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and 10 mm NaF, and a protease inhibitor mixture) by overlayering 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 20, 25, and 30% iodixanol (Optiprep; Nycomed Pharma AS) in centrifuge tubes. The centrifuge tubes were equilibrated for 3\u20134 h at 4\u00b0C before use. The spinal cords from the control and mutant mice were collected and homogenized with a Dounce-type homogenizer in homogenization buffer [containing (in mm): 20 HEPES, pH 7.3, 40 KCl, 5 EGTA, 5 MgCl2 containing 1 Na3VO4 and 10 NaF, and a protease inhibitor mixture) at 4\u00b0C. Homogenates were spun at 1000 \u00d7  for 10 min and the supernatants were centrifuged at 65,000 \u00d7  for 60 min. The resulting pellets were suspended in diluent buffer, placed on the top of iodixanol gradients, and subjected to centrifugation at 38,000 rpm (SW41 Beckman rotor), 4\u00b0C for 90 min. Seventeen fractions were collected and analyzed by Western blotting.Cells or brain tissues were lysed in lysis buffer [1% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, plus a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Complete Mini)]. Protein concentrations were determined by Coomassie Plus (Pierce). The same amount of protein from each sample was separated on Novex precast polyacrylamide 10% gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. After overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies, the immunoreactive bands were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad, 1:20,000), using an ECL kit (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). For immunoprecipitations, equal amounts of protein from cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with selected antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight. Either anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG agarose (25 \u03bcl) (Roche) was then added to each sample and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 2 h on a rocker platform. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with the washing buffer (0.1% Triton, 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). The agarose beads were resuspended in 30 \u03bcl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 3 min to release the proteins. After 1 min of centrifugation, the supernatants were separated on 10% or 12% Tris-glycine gels.\u2212/\u2212 and wild-type mice were anesthetized and perfused transcardially with 0.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4. Tissue blocks were postfixed for 1\u20133 h in the same fixative buffer at 4\u00b0C and rinsed in 0.05 m KPBS at pH 7.4. Serial 50-\u03bcm-thick vibratome sections of the spinal cord were cut and fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide with 1.5% potassium ferricyanide, dehydrated with ethanol and propylene oxide, and infiltrated with Spurr's resin. The vibratome sections were flat-embedded between two glass microscope slides, one coated with Liquid Release Agent (Electron Microscopy Sciences), and polymerized overnight at 70\u00b0C. After the coated slide was removed, a BEEM capsule was placed over each section, filled with Poly/Bed 812 (Polysciences), and polymerized overnight. Capsules were removed by concurrent warming and prying. Thin sections were collected onto 200-mesh copper grids, counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined in a JEOL 100CXII transmission electron microscope. Images were collected as TIFF files with a MegaView III digital camera (SoftImaging System).Twelve-month-old mutant and wild-type mice were used for the determination of retrograde transport using the neurotracer fluorogold. Mice were anesthetized and the left lower hind limb was positioned by strapping to a platform. A small stab incision 2\u20133 mm long was made in the skin to expose the underlying muscle at the widest point of the lower limb (\u223c7\u201310 mm distal to the femorotibial joint). A 10 \u03bcl Hamilton syringe was used to deliver 1 \u03bcl of a 2% solution of fluorogold (w/v) in 0.9% saline at a medial, central, and lateral site \u223c2 mm deep in the gastrocnemius muscle of the mouse. Mice were killed at 46 h, the lumbar intumescence of the spinal cord was harvested and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde made in PBS, and floated in 20% sucrose overnight until the cords sank. Longitudinal and coronal sections were prepared by standard methods and subjected to histochemistry analyses described as above. The total number of motor neurons accumulating fluorogold in their cell bodies was counted for each mouse. The mean number of cell bodies accumulating fluorogold was calculated for wild-type versus mutant mice (12 months old) ( = 6 for each group) for the 46 h time point.Control and mutant mice were anesthetized and the sciatic nerve was exposed at the level of the hip flexure 3 cm distal to the L4-L5 DRGs. Two ligations, 2.5 mm apart, were placed on the sciatic nerve with surgical sutures. The wound was closed and the animals were allowed to recover for 6 or 24 h. Subsequently, ligated sciatic nerves were used for immunoblotting. In addition, the sciatic nerve was transected in one group of animals.The behavioral performance scores of each mouse group in the tests as well as the sciatic nerve and root morphometry data were presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. Any differences between groups were examined by performing either a Student's  test, a Wilcoxon signed ranks test, or a one-way ANOVA followed by a  test, as indicated in each related figure legend. A  value <0.05 was considered significant.A \u2212/\u2212 mouse line was established in which the loss of MOCA expression was verified by Western blotting and by the expression of \u03b2-gal (Fig. 1,). \u03b2-gal expression is detected in all regions of the CNS, consistent with the  gene expression pattern shown previously (Kashiwa et al., 2000; Namekata et al., 2004).Expression of MOCA in the CNS and behavioral phenotypes of the \u2212/\u2212 mouse line. , The expression of MOCA in the wild-type, hemizygous, and homozygous knock-out mice. , The expression of \u03b2-galactosidase in several representative brain structures of the wild-type (top) and homozygous knock-out (bottom) mice, including the motor cortex (CTX), caudate putamen (CP), cerebellum (Cb), and spinal cord (Sc). The last panel shows the \u03b2-gal expression pattern in the ventral horn of the spinal cord (blue) counterstained with neutral red. Scale bar, 500 \u03bcm (left three panels) or 50 \u03bcm (the right color panel). , , A clasping phenotype is shown in a mutant mouse (\u2212/\u2212) at the age of 20 months when its tail is lifted (), a behavior that is not present in control (). , Motor performance was assessed by the rotarod test. The average time on the rod for each mouse group (2 months of age) is shown as the mean \u00b1 SD. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA ( = 18, ** < 0.01). , The motor learning ability was measured by continuing the training of the mice on rotarod performance. Four trials were performed daily for three consecutive days using three groups of animals at the age of 16 months. Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD. The data were subjected to a mixed ANOVA in which days were considered the repeated measure. Only the control group at the age of 16 months shows a significant difference ( = 4.42; ** = 0.02). , The difference of the locomotor activities in the mutant and control mice was assessed by an open field test. The travel distance in every 5 min for each mouse group (2 months,  = 12) is shown as the mean \u00b1 SD. The statistics were performed by a Wilcoxon signed ranks test for related samples. * < 0.05.\u2212/\u2212 mice have a normal lifespan and successfully produce offspring. No significant difference in body weight is found between mutant and wild-type groups at any age. The common clinical features of the mutant mice are gait abnormalities, including limb weakness, ataxia, and an impaired ability to swim. The mutant mice also show spinning and clasping phenotypes when their tails are lifted (Fig. 1,). Therefore, the mutant mice may have defects in sensory and/or motor function.The motor performance of \u2212/\u2212 mice was further examined using the rotarod test. The abnormal behaviors are detectable using this procedure at 2 months of age (Fig. 1). The average time on the rod for the \u2212/\u2212 mouse group at 2 months of age was 31 s, compared with 65 s for the control group and 46 s for the +/\u2212 group. To evaluate motor learning ability, we measured the number of trials needed for animals to reach the maximal latency to fall off the accelerating rotarod. Four trials were performed daily for three consecutive days using three groups of animals at two different ages. Although rotarod performance tended to improve after 3 d of training trials in all groups tested, only the control group at the age of 16 months showed a significant difference (Fig. 1). It follows that MOCA deficiency causes impaired motor performance with partial retention of motor learning ability.We next performed an open field test to evaluate activities related to spontaneous locomotion. Over a 100 min monitoring period, there was no significant difference between control and homozygous mutant groups in total travel distance (data not shown). However, when the data were analyzed by splitting travel distance into successive 5 min time bins, the distance traveled every 5 min by each group differs significantly between 45 and 95 min (Fig. 1). Therefore, \u2212/\u2212 mice have decreased overall activity compared with control mice, which may reflect weakness caused by the loss of MOCA.To determine whether locomotor impairments in \u2212/\u2212 mice reflect neuromuscular impairment, skeletal muscle and sciatic nerve were examined. The muscles were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to evaluate the basic tissue organization and cellular structure, and myofibrillar ATPase reactivity was performed to identify fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscle fibers. Compared with wild-type mice, an excessive variability in myofiber size was found in some, but not all, 2-year-old \u2212/\u2212 mice, with atrophic fibers of both fiber types having a round to polygonal shape (supplemental Fig. S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).Morphometric analysis of the L5 dorsal and ventral roots revealed a shift in the size\u2013frequency distribution toward larger fibers in the \u2212/\u2212 mice compared with +/+ mice that was reflected by increases in mean axonal diameter and the relative frequency of large fibers (supplemental Table S1 and Fig. S3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). The apparent shift toward larger fibers in \u2212/\u2212 mice was not associated with a change in myelinated fiber number or density in either the dorsal or ventral roots (supplemental Table S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). In contrast, there was a nonsignificant trend for a shift in the size\u2013frequency distribution of the more distal mixed sciatic nerve of \u2212/\u2212 mice toward smaller fibers compared with +/+ mice that was associated with trends for a decrease in mean axonal diameter and an increase in the relative frequency of small fibers (supplemental Fig. S2 and Table S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).To determine whether any changes in the CNS were associated with the MOCA deficiency, the brain and spinal cord structure and morphology were examined first by Nissl staining. The mutant cortex and cerebellum are slightly smaller compared with the age-matched controls. However, the overall brain and spinal structure is intact in the \u2212/\u2212 mice without apparent loss or disorganization of any major brain or spinal cord region. We next assessed nerve fibers in the CNS of MOCA-knock-out mice. Because abnormal NF accumulation is a marker for axon pathology (Coleman, 2005; Petzold, 2005), we examined the patterns of NF expression in the brain and spinal cord. No significant change was observed in the cortex, but pathological changes were seen consistently in other areas, including the cerebellum, brainstem, habenula, and spinal cord. Abnormal axonal spheroids are stained by NF antibodies in all these structures (Fig. 2, and below), which are consistent with the behavioral abnormalities seen in MOCA-knock-out mice. Because the spinal cords of the MOCA mutant mice show the most pronounced pathology, subsequent analyses are focused on this tissue., Abnormal axonal swellings/spheroids (indicated by arrows or circles) stained by an antibody against NF-68 are present in the spinal cord (), the dorsal column of the brainstem (), the habenula of \u2212/\u2212 mice (), and the cerebellum (), but not in the corresponding areas of control mice (, , , ). DH, Dorsal column; VH, ventral column; cc, central canal; AP, area postrema; Gr, gracile nucleus; Cu, cuneate nucleus; NTS, nucleus of the solitary tract; XII, hypoglossal nucleus; MH, medial habenular nucleus; LH, lateral habenular nucleus; sm, stria medullaris; prf, primary fissure; Sim, simple lobule. Scale bar, 200 \u03bcm.Series of sections through spinal cord were stained with different NF antibodies including NF-68 (Fig. 3,), which recognizes the NF light chain; SMI-31 (Fig. 3,), which recognizes phosphorylated NF heavy chain (NF-200), the active form of the protein; and SMI-32 (Fig. 3,), which recognizes nonphosphorylated NF-200. Abnormal axonal spheroids stained by all three NF antibodies are present in the spinal cord of 20-month-old mutant mice but not in age-matched controls. These abnormal axonal spheroids are spread throughout the gray matter and occasionally are seen in the white matter of the mutant spinal cord; the NF inclusions are rarely seen within neuronal cell bodies. The NF-containing spheroids have different shapes and sizes ranging from 5 to 20 \u03bcm in diameter (Fig. 3). Larger spheroids often have a fibrillary appearance. Similar spheroids are not seen in the mutant spinal cord on postnatal day 1 (supplemental Fig. S4B, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), but are present as early as 2 months of age (supplemental Fig. S4D, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). These abnormal NF aggregates suggest widespread axonal dystrophy in \u2212/\u2212 mice and that the defects become apparent only after birth., Abnormal axonal swellings/spheroids representing degenerative axons are present in the spinal cord of \u2212/\u2212 mice at the age of 20 months (, , ) but not in the age-matched controls (, , ). These abnormal axonal spheroids contain aggregates of neurofilaments. The coronal sections of the spinal cord are stained with different neurofilament antibodies including NF-68 (, ), which recognizes the NF light chain; SMI-31 (, ), which recognizes phosphorylated NF heavy chain; and SMI-32 (, ), which recognizes nonphosphorylated NF heavy chain. , Closer views of axonal spheroids of different sizes. , Western blotting patterns of NFs from different brain regions of control (+/+) and \u2212/\u2212 (\u2212/\u2212) mice. CTX, cerebral cortex; STR, striatum; CB, cerebellum; SC, spinal cord. Arrows indicate the degraded products of nonphosphorylated NF-200. GAPDH is the loading control. , , Activation of microglia in \u2212/\u2212 mice. The activation of microglia is present in the spinal cord of \u2212/\u2212 () but not in control () mice at the age of 20 months. Scale bar, 50 \u03bcm.In addition to immunostaining, we examined the expression of the three NF subunits in the cortex and the spinal cord by Western blotting. The levels of NF-68 and NF-150 in the mutant mice are similar to those in age-matched controls (Fig. 3). There are also no differences in the levels of the full-length phosphorylated (detected by antibody SMI-31) and nonphosphorylated (antibody SMI-32) NF-200 in \u2212/\u2212 mice relative to controls. However, two protein fragments with molecular weights of 25 and 50 kDa, respectively, react with the antibody to nonphosphorylated NF-200 only in the mutant spinal cord (Fig. 3, arrows). Therefore, NF-200 metabolism may be affected in the spinal cords of mutant mice.Because inflammatory responses are commonly associated with axonal damage, we examined microglial activation by staining with an antibody against ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1). Iba1 is a Ca2+-binding protein produced by monocytes and microglia, and alterations in its expression are associated with inflammation (Ito et al., 1998). Iba1-immunoreactive cells in the spinal cord of \u2212/\u2212 mice at both 20 (Fig. 3,) and 2 (supplemental Fig. S4, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) months of age display thickening and retraction of their processes, indicative of microglial activation. These data demonstrate that there is both neurofilament accumulation and microglial activation in the spinal cord of \u2212/\u2212 mice. Both may contribute to the progressive damage and dysfunction resulting from MOCA deficiency.To clarify the nature of the defect in \u2212/\u2212 mice, we examined axons by electron microscopy. The spinal cord of wild-type mice shows the normal appearance of axonal structures with key axoplasmic features including microtubules and NFs (Fig. 4,). We did not see a disorganization of cytoskeletal components, or abnormal vesicle and organelle accumulations in the wild-type mice. In contrast, the spinal cord of \u2212/\u2212 mice shows several different types of abnormal axonal morphologies involving both vesicles and structural proteins. Large numbers of organelles and vesicles consisting of haphazardly arranged vesicles, mitochondria, sporadic multilamellar bodies, and vacuoles accumulate in spinal cord axonal swellings of \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 4,). Degenerating mitochondria and lysosomal electron-dense bodies are common signs of axonal dystrophy (Yu et al., 2005). Some of the structures also fit the criteria used to define autophagic vacuoles (AVs) including a size >0.25 \u03bcm in diameter, a double limiting membrane, and the presence of multiple membranous organelle-derived structures within a single vacuole (Glaumann et al., 1981; Herrera et al., 2006). AVs found in dystrophic axonal swellings of \u2212/\u2212 mice represent both early and late stages of autophagy (Fig. 4,) (Yu et al., 2005). The early-stage vacuoles (Fig. 4, labeled orange 1) include double membrane-bound vacuoles containing engulfed organelles. The late-stage vacuoles (Fig. 4, labeled blue 2) include residual bodies containing the engulfed degraded organelles as well as translucent and dense multivesicular and multilamellar bodies with single and double outer membranes. These abnormal accumulations of AVs are not present in wild-type mice., Autophagic vacuoles are present in spinal cord dystrophic axons of 20-month-old \u2212/\u2212 mice. , A general view of the wild-type spinal cord showing the normal appearance of myelinated and nonmyelinated axons. , A closer look at the axonal cytoskeleton and organization showing microtubules (m, arrow) are often in bundles and more irregularly spaced compared with evenly distributed NFs (f, arrow).

These abnormal structures are often surrounded by AVs (arrows) or mixed with neurofilamentous hypertrophy, a form of terminal degeneration described in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (Brown and Sawchenko, 2007) (Fig. 4,). Finally, we observed highly deteriorated axonal morphologies, including swellings containing many vacuoles distributed among the cytoskeletal components, organelles, and AVs (Fig. 4), or neurofilamentous hypertrophy within the axoplasm in which little axon cytoskeletal structure remains (Fig. 4). These latter morphologies clearly represent axonal atrophy and degeneration in the spinal cord of \u2212/\u2212 mice.The proteasome\u2013ubiquitin pathway can play a role in axon degeneration, because its disruption leads to abnormal protein accumulation in axons (Ehlers, 2004). To determine whether this pathway is affected in \u2212/\u2212 mice, we examined ubiquitinated proteins by Western blotting. There is a dense smear of high molecular weight ubiquitinated proteins in the spinal cord protein extracts of mutant mice, but much less in age-matched controls (Fig. 5). There is less aggregated material in extracts of cortex from \u2212/\u2212 mice, although there is an unknown 25 kDa protein in the cortex that is always highly ubiquitinated in MOCA-deficient mice. The high molecular weight protein bands in \u2212/\u2212 mice represent aggregated ubiquitinated proteins similar to those observed in many cases of neurodegeneration (Rubinsztein, 2006). The protein extracts were further examined after separation into Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions. The expression of the polyubiquitin-conjugated proteins is significantly increased in both soluble and insoluble fractions of the spinal cord of mutant mice (Fig. 5,), with a smaller difference in the cortex (except for the 25 kDa protein noted above). In addition, some dystrophic neurite structures were labeled by the ubiquitin antibody in older \u2212/\u2212 mice (20 months), but none were detected in younger mice (2 months) (Fig. 5), showing age-dependent accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in the mutant mice. These data suggest that protein accumulation in axons may contribute to age-dependent changes in axon morphology and function.Accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in the spinal cord of 12-month-old \u2212/\u2212 mice. , Western blotting patterns of ubiquitinated proteins from different brain regions of control (+/+) and \u2212/\u2212 (\u2212/\u2212) mice.

Ub, ubiquitin-containing aggregates.We next asked whether the abnormal features in \u2212/\u2212 mice correlate with axon functional alterations. Retrograde tracer studies were performed to assess axonal transport. \u2212/\u2212 mice and age-matched wild-type controls were injected with the retrograde neurotracer fluorogold in the gastrocnemius muscle and killed 46 h later to compare the number of motor neuron cell bodies that had accumulated tracer (LaMonte et al., 2002). Longitudinal sections of spinal cord were made and the accumulation of the fluorogold tracer was examined in the motor neuron pools that innervate the injected muscle (Fig. 6,). Sections from wild-type animals revealed heavy labeling of motor neuron columns, whereas those from \u2212/\u2212 mice of the same age contained fewer and less intensely labeled cells (Fig. 6). To obtain quantitative estimates, the numbers of fluorogold-labeled cells were counted in cross-sections of the spinal cord ( = 6). Loss of MOCA causes an average 55% reduction in the number of labeled cells in the spinal cord of mutant mice relative to controls (Fig. 6). To ask whether this decrement is caused by the loss of motor neurons, a series of coronal sections of lumbar spinal cords derived from age-matched +/+ and \u2212/\u2212 mice were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and using an antibody against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), a marker for spinal motor neurons. We did not find any significant difference in motor neuron numbers in the spinal cord between groups (Fig. 6,). In addition, we probed for degeneration of perikaryal elements in the spinal cord by staining with Fluoro-Jade C. Fluoro-Jade C is a polyanionic fluorescein derivative that specifically binds to degenerating neurons (Schmued et al., 2005). We failed to observe any remarkable or consistent staining with Fluoro Jade C in the spinal cord of either wild-type or mutant mice, confirming the absence of motor neuron degeneration. These data suggest that impaired retrograde transport resulting from the MOCA deficiency does not cause loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord. Therefore, it is most likely that the MOCA deficiency causes an impairment of retrograde axonal transport, which is consistent with the observed axonal pathology., Impaired axonal transport in \u2212/\u2212 mice.

Statistical analysis was done by a Student's  test ( = 6, ** < 0.01). , , Schematic presentation of sciatic nerve ligation () and the APP expression levels of different parts in the axon (). The ligation sites are indicated by arrows. The proximal (P part) and distal (D part) segments (on the cell body end) relative to the ligation sites, and the remaining distal site (toward the cell body end; E part) were collected for Western blot analysis after the surgery. The levels of APP in each axonal part were analyzed by using 22C11 antibody. , The percentage of APP expression in the proximal (P part) and distal (D part) segments relative to the controls of similar segments of wild-type animals was quantified by NIH Image tools and the statistics were performed by a Student's  test. The data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD ( = 6, ** < 0.01). Scale bar, 50 \u03bcm.Because APP is transported by an anterograde mechanism (Koo et al., 1990), we ligated sciatic nerve and examined levels of APP in different segments of the nerve to determine whether the loss of MOCA also affects anterograde transport in \u2212/\u2212 mice. Sciatic nerves were ligated in the middle, and segments proximal and distal to the point of ligature were assayed for APP after 6 and 24 h by Western blotting. Six pairs of control and mutant mice were used for the analysis. Because the pattern of APP accumulation was very similar at 6 and 24 h after ligation, 6 h after ligation was used for collecting tissues. In +/+ mice, we observed a substantial increase of APP on the site proximal to the ligation point, accompanied by a striking depletion in the distal half (Fig. 6,). In contrast, the level of APP in the proximal site is significantly less in the \u2212/\u2212 mice compared with that in the control, whereas the APP level in the distal site of mutant mice is consistently higher than that seen in controls. The level of a slow transport marker, \u03b2-tubulin, remained unchanged. The loss of MOCA results in an approximately 40% decrease in APP accumulation proximal to the ligation site, whereas APP levels in the cell body segment of the sciatic nerve of \u2212/\u2212 mice are \u223c8 times greater than in the control mice. These results show that anterograde axonal transport of APP is impaired in \u2212/\u2212 mice.To identify a possible mechanism for the cytoskeletal disorganization and impaired axonal transport in \u2212/\u2212 mice, we fractionated the spinal cord using 0\u201330% continuous iodixanol density gradients and asked whether there is an aberrant distribution of cargo and structural proteins in \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 7). In control mice, actin is distributed throughout the gradient, with the higher densities in the first few \u201clight\u201d fractions. In contrast, much less actin is found in both the intermediate and heaviest fractions from \u2212/\u2212 mice. The distribution pattern of \u03b2-tubulin is similar to that of actin, but with a much smaller decrease in levels in the intermediate fractions from \u2212/\u2212 mice. There are no reproducible changes in the distribution patterns of a marker for neurofilaments, NF-68, and the synaptic protein synaptophysin, in \u2212/\u2212 mice relative to controls. These data suggest that the MOCA deficiency alters protein-protein interactions or the polymerization of proteins within the spinal cord and that actin is the most robustly affected protein.Alterations in actin dynamics are mediated by cofilin in \u2212/\u2212 mice. , A representative spinal cord subcellular fractionation using a 0\u201330% continuous iodixanol gradient ( = 3). Each fraction is presented as the percentage of total protein (sum of OD in scanned blot) for each protein. , Western blotting patterns of cofilin, phosphorylated cofilin, LIMK1, phosphorylated LIMK, PAK1/2/3, and phosphorylated PAK from the cerebral cortex and spinal cord of control (+/+) and \u2212/\u2212 (\u2212/\u2212) mice. GAPDH was used as a loading control. The percentage change in the expression level for each protein is normalized to GAPDH and shown as the mean \u00b1 SD. Statistical analysis was done by a Student's  test ( = 6, ** < 0.01). CTX, cerebral cortex; SC, spinal cord. , Immunostaining of cultured cortical neurons with the antibodies recognizing cofilin (green) and NF-200 (red), and merged (overlap yellow). The formation of rod-like structures (arrows) stained by the cofilin antibody is present in cultured \u2212/\u2212 (\u2212/\u2212) neurons (C4, C6). The rod-like structures are largely confined to the thinner neurites, as previously shown (Minamide et al., 2000). Scale bar, 15 \u03bcm.Cofilin is a major actin-depolymerizing factor in the mammalian CNS and is a target of many signaling pathways that perturb the actin cytoskeleton (Ono, 2003; Sarmiere and Bamburg, 2004). Importantly, the regulation of cofilin is downstream of Rac1, and MOCA is a GEF that mediates Rac1 activity (Grimsley et al., 2004). Cofilin inclusions are found in AD brains, and the formation of rod-like structures containing cofilin is associated with neurodegeneration (Minamide et al., 2000). Therefore, we asked whether the MOCA deficiency leads to an alteration of cofilin activity, which is modulated by its phosphorylation. Western blots were performed using specific antibodies recognizing cofilin and phosphorylated-cofilin (Ser3). Levels of cofilin expression in the spinal cord and the cortex of \u2212/\u2212 mice are similar to those of control mice (Fig. 7). However, the levels of phosphorylated cofilin are reduced by \u223c50% in the cortex and spinal cord of \u2212/\u2212 mice relative to controls (Fig. 7). These data suggest that the loss of MOCA causes an increase in cofilin activity, which may have a direct impact on actin dynamics.A pathological alteration in cofilin activity results in the appearance of rod-like structures in cultured neurons (Minamide et al., 2000). Therefore, this assay was used to confirm the phosphorylation data. Cortical neurons derived from the control and \u2212/\u2212 mice were cultured for 3 d and stained with cofilin and neurofilament antibodies. In control neurons, cofilin is evenly distributed (Fig. 71\u20133). However, in \u2212/\u2212 neurons, there were rod-like structures positively stained in thin neurites by the cofilin antibody (Fig. 74,6). Approximately 50% of the \u2212/\u2212 neurons contained the rod-like structures in the mutant cultures, whereas essentially none were present in cultured control neurons. These data suggest that the MOCA deficiency causes the dysfunction and abnormal distribution of cofilin similar to that reported previously in cultured neurons after the induction of neurodegeneration (Minamide et al., 2000).Cofilin phosphorylation is mediated by upstream signals that include the activation of Rho/Rac GTPases, PAK, and LIMK (Ridley, 2006). PAKs are primary targets for Rho/Rac GTPases; most of the closest relatives of Rac1 and Cdc42 activate at least one of these kinases (Ridley, 2006). The phosphorylation and activation of LIMKs is regulated by PAKs (Edwards et al., 1999; Gohla and Bokoch, 2002). Because MOCA activates Rac1 and modifies the actin cytoskeleton in cultured neurons (Grimsley et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2005), we asked whether the overactivation of cofilin caused by the MOCA deficiency is the result of a change in the PAK\u2013LIMK pathway. Western blots were performed using specific antibodies recognizing LIMK1 and 2, phosphorylated LIMK (Thr508 and Thr505 for LIMK1 and 2, respectively), PAK1/2/3, and phosphorylated PAK (Ser144, Ser141, or Ser139 for PAK1, 2, or 3). Consistent with the decrease in cofilin phosphorylation, the levels of phosphorylated LIMK are also reduced by \u223c50% in the spinal cord of \u2212/\u2212 mice relative to control animals, but not in the cortex, where minimal unphosphorylated protein could be detected (Fig. 7). In contrast, the overall level of phosphorylated PAK remains similar between the control and \u2212/\u2212 groups in the cortex and spinal cord, but the expression level of PAK1/2/3 is increased by two- to threefold in the spinal cord. These data show that the PAK\u2013LIMK pathway is affected by the loss of MOCA, and that the changes in this pathway are more pronounced in the spinal cord than in the cortex. A different pathway from MOCA to cofilin must be operational in the cortex because cofilin phosphorylation in cortex and spinal cord are similarly decreased.To clarify the function of MOCA, we have generated a \u2212/\u2212 mouse line and analyzed the resultant phenotype. The mice have sensorimotor impairments and structural changes that include axonal swellings containing NFs and AVs in several brain regions including the spinal cord and cerebellum. These changes are associated with impaired axonal transport. Because axonal pathology is the major abnormality found in \u2212/\u2212 mice, it is concluded that MOCA is essential for maintaining the functional integrity of axons and that its loss causes pronounced central axonal pathology and behavioral abnormalities.The only mutations of the  gene linked to a human disease to date are associated with ADHD (de Silva et al., 2003). A chromosome disruption was found in an Australian family, and all individuals carrying this mutation display the ADHD phenotype. The disruption was caused by the insertion of a gene called  (a sodium/hydrogen exchanger protein) into the MOCA genomic locus. However, it is not clear whether this disruption causes a loss or gain of either gene's function, or which gene is responsible for the phenotype. We performed several behavioral tests including the startle response (data not shown), open field, and rotarod tests to clarify the phenotypic changes caused by the loss of MOCA. All of these procedures demonstrate that \u2212/\u2212 mice are physically less active compared with age-matched controls and have various sensory (ataxia and proprioceptive deficits) and motor (weakness) impairments. Therefore, it appears that the loss of MOCA leads to impaired sensorimotor behaviors, but the ADHD-like phenotype cannot be formally excluded.The most striking pathology in \u2212/\u2212 mice is in the spinal cord, which has axonal swellings containing abnormal accumulations of NFs indicative of dystrophic axons. NFs are the primary constituents of the axon cytoskeleton and are formed by heteropolymerization of the NF triplet proteins, NF-L, NF-M, and NF-H (Hoffman and Lasek, 1975; Hirokawa et al., 1984). NFs work together with actin filaments and microtubules to maintain neuronal morphology and function (Lee and Cleveland, 1996). Because NFs have a long half-life relative to other proteins, damaged NFs are likely to accumulate, leading to axonal pathology (Lee and Cleveland, 1996). We did not observe motor neuron death in \u2212/\u2212 mice or loss of myelinated fibers in the dorsal and ventral roots, but NF spheroids accumulate in axonal fibers and only rarely appear in cell bodies, suggesting that the axon is the major target affected by the loss of MOCA.Electron micrographs show that cellular organelles and AVs accumulate in some abnormal axonal swellings in \u2212/\u2212 mice. These morphological changes are almost identical to those found in the spinal cord of the APP/PS1ki mouse model of AD (Wirths et al., 2007). This mouse model carries the mutant AD genes including human  with Swedish and London mutations, and murine  with two familial AD-linked mutations (PS1M233T and PS1L235P). Because immature AVs move along axons by regulated retrograde transport (Hollenbeck, 1993) and the defective AV transport may impede lysosomal degradation, the accumulation of AVs in \u2212/\u2212 mice is most likely linked to impaired axonal transport.The autophagic pathway is involved in the turnover and recycling of cytoplasm and organelles engulfed within double-membrane vesicles, known as autophagosomes (Shintani and Klionsky, 2004). Similar to the AV morphologies observed in dystrophic neurites of AD transgenic mice, axonal swellings in \u2212/\u2212 mice also contain autophagosomes and other immature AVs, suggesting impaired maturation of nascent AVs (Yu et al., 2005). Autophagy plays a major role in the clearance of most long-lived and unfavorable proteins that aggregate in cells as a consequence of aging and disease (Rubinsztein, 2006; Simonsen et al., 2007). A deficiency of autophagy in neural cells causes neurodegeneration and leads to the accumulation of ubiquitin-containing inclusion bodies (Hara et al., 2006; Komatsu et al., 2006; Simonsen et al., 2007). We also find that polyubiquitin-conjugated proteins are elevated in the spinal cord of \u2212/\u2212 mice and that this effect increases with age, suggesting that their accumulation is a consequence of inefficient or overwhelmed autophagic activities. In addition to the disorganization of the axonal cytoskeleton and the accumulation of AVs, we observed axonal morphologies indicative of advanced axonal degeneration in the spinal cord and brainstem of \u2212/\u2212 mice. Impaired axonal transport is a common feature of many neurological diseases. Our data from fluorogold-labeling and sciatic nerve ligation studies demonstrate impaired axonal transport in \u2212/\u2212 mice. The accentuation of proximo-distal tapering of peripheral myelinated fibers in the roots and sciatic nerve may be a structural correlate of the axonal transport abnormalities in \u2212/\u2212 mice, because impaired axonal transport in experimental diabetic neuropathy is associated with an increase in axonal caliber proximally and a decrease distally (Medori et al., 1988). APP is transported in a fast anterograde manner within axons (Koo et al., 1993; Kamal et al., 2000; Lazarov et al., 2005; Stokin et al., 2005). PS is involved in APP trafficking (Naruse et al., 1998; Cai et al., 2003) and PS mutations impair APP axonal transport (Pigino et al., 2003; Lazarov et al., 2007). We show here that axonal transport of APP is defective in \u2212/\u2212 mice, consistent with our previous observation showing that MOCA interacts with PSs and regulates APP metabolism (Kashiwa et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2002).Because the axonal transport system comprises various cargos, motor proteins, cytoskeleton components, and accessory regulatory molecules, disruption of any of these components could result in defective transport. Our electron micrographs show that axonal cytoskeletal components are disorganized in the spinal cord and brainstem of \u2212/\u2212 mice. To explore the cause for the initiation of cytoskeletal disorganization, we have focused on the actin cytoskeleton because of the aberrant distribution of actin in iodixanol gradients of spinal cord. The actin cytoskeleton has been directly linked to the abnormal accumulation of NFs and is required for NF transport (Yang et al., 1999; Jung et al., 2004). The disruption of BPAG1 (bullous pemphigoid antigen 1), a protein involved in anchoring neuronal intermediate filaments to the actin cytoskeleton, leads to axonal swellings containing NF aggregates similar to those in \u2212/\u2212 mice (Yang et al., 1999). We have previously shown that MOCA colocalizes with actin fibers and that MOCA is involved in regulating neurite outgrowth (Chen et al., 2005). In addition, MOCA is a GEF for the Rho/Rac GTPases, which play major roles in regulating the actin cytoskeleton (Ridley, 2006). Therefore, MOCA may be required for the maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton and its loss may lead to defects in the actin dynamics, NF accumulation, and defective axonal transport.Actin dynamics are regulated by a plethora of actin-binding proteins under the control of specific signaling pathways. Among this group, cofilin has been implicated in neurite outgrowth and axonal transport (Bray et al., 1992; Meberg and Bamburg, 2000), and cofilin and its related upstream signals have been implicated in the generation of dystrophic neurites (Minamide et al., 2000; Zhao et al., 2005; Maloney and Bamburg, 2007). Cofilin is the major actin-depolymerizing factor in the CNS and is required for the proper assembly and function of actin fibers (Sarmiere and Bamburg, 2004). The activity of cofilin is regulated by LIM kinase. LIM kinase phosphorylates cofilin and inactivates it, leading to an increase in polymerized actin (Arber et al., 1998). LIM kinase is, in turn, a substrate for PAK, which is activated by Rho/Rac GTPases (Edwards et al., 1999; Gohla and Bokoch, 2002). We show here that the MOCA deficiency causes the formation of cofilin-containing rod-like structures in cultured cells, with a corresponding decrease in cofilin phosphorylation in both the spinal cord and cortex, suggesting an increase in cofilin activity in \u2212/\u2212 mice. In addition, LIM kinase phosphorylation is decreased in the spinal cord, but not in the cortex of these animals. These data suggest that the actin cytoskeleton in the spinal cord is affected by the loss of MOCA via the disruption of the LIM kinase\u2013cofilin pathway. Although there is a similar decrease in cofilin phosphorylation in spinal cord and cortex, and cultured cortical neurons display cofilin abnormalities, there are no significant pathological alterations in the cortex. This difference may be attributable to the relative lengths of axons and transport distances, or unknown differences in signaling pathways affected by MOCA.The other upstream component of the LIM kinase pathway, PAK, is also altered in response to the MOCA deficiency. Total PAK (PAK1, 2, and 3) expression is increased in the spinal cord, but, again, not in the cortex. MOCA is a member of the DOCK180 family (C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Vuori, 2002) and the other members, such as DOCK4 and DOCK180, may partially replace the MOCA-mediated function after the cells lose MOCA. Therefore, the increase in the total PAK may be a compensatory reaction in response to the MOCA deficiency, and the cells need to make more PAKs to react with other members of the DOCK180 family to overcome the loss of MOCA. However, the ratio of phosphorylated PAK versus total PAK is reduced in the spinal cord, consistent with the reduced phosphorylation of cofilin and LIM kinase. Therefore, the loss of MOCA GEF activity alters the PAK\u2013LIM kinase pathway in the spinal cord that regulates cofilin and the actin cytoskeleton. The intermediate pathway between MOCA and cofilin is likely to be different in the cortex. Our data are in line with a growing body of evidence supporting a link between alterations in the actin cytoskeleton and axonal transport defects in the early stages of many neurological diseases (Minamide et al., 2000; Zhao et al., 2006; Maloney and Bamburg, 2007).Axonal dysfunction is not always associated with nerve cell loss, and in the majority of cases, only select subsets of neurons are affected. For example, in many mutations that are linked to motor neuropathies, axons are the only major disease target (Pasinelli and Brown, 2006). In human AD brains, loss of synapses is widely distributed, whereas neuronal loss is selective and localized (Masliah et al., 2006). Identifying a common pathway linking the initiation of axonal dysfunction with axonal degeneration should provide a significant advance in understanding the mechanisms involved in the neurodegenerative process and aid in the development of an early treatment for many neurological diseases. Based on our morphological and mechanistic evidence, we present a working model to delineate the likely progression of axonal degeneration occurring in \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 8). Initially, the loss of MOCA causes the disruption of the axonal cytoskeleton because of a dysregulation in actin polymerization through the PAK\u2013LIM kinase\u2013cofilin pathway. Altered actin polymerization leads to the disruption of axonal transport promoting further disorganization of structural proteins and the accumulation of organelles and AVs. Protein turnover is impaired because of the inability of protein clearance mechanisms, such as autophagy, to remove debris, leading to more abnormal protein aggregation and accumulation, and impaired axonal trafficking. The final steps are the vacuolization and hypertrophism of the axonal cytoskeleton, which leads to axonal degeneration. Therefore, \u2212/\u2212 mice provide a novel model to study the connections between the distinct molecular and pathological features that define many neurological diseases.A model for the progression of axonal degeneration in \u2212/\u2212 mice.

Viewing appetizing foods alone can induce food craving and eating, although there is considerable variation in this \u201cexternal food sensitivity\u201d (EFS). Because increased EFS is associated with overeating, identifying its neural correlates is important for understanding the current epidemic of obesity. Animal research has identified the ventral striatum, amygdala, hypothalamus, medial prefrontal and premotor cortices as key interacting structures for feeding. However, it is unclear whether a similar network exists in humans and how it is affected by EFS. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we showed that viewing appetizing compared with bland foods produced changes in connectivity among the human ventral striatum, amygdala, anterior cingulate and premotor cortex that were strongly correlated with EFS. Differences in the dynamic interactions within the human appetitive network in response to pictures of appetizing foods may determine an individual's risk of obesity.Eating behavior can be triggered by internal signals of energy deficits such as hunger. However, external cues such as the sight of appetizing foods can also evoke a desire to eat, even in the absence of hunger. This external food sensitivity (EFS) varies considerably across individuals, and high EFS has been associated with increased risk for obesity when exposed to a food-rich environment (Braet and Van Strien, 1997; H\u00f6rchner et al., 2002; Braet et al., 2007; Burton et al., 2007; Elfhag et al., 2007, 2008). Given recent concerns that advertisements and packaging can initiate and maintain increased food intake, identifying the neurobiological basis of EFS is crucial for understanding obesity.Animal research has implicated a broad network mediating feeding behavior, including subcortical (ventral striatum, amygdala, hypothalamus), allocortical (hippocampus), and frontal cortical regions (motor, premotor, orbital and medial prefrontal cortices) (Masuda et al., 1997; Nishijo et al., 1997; Baldo et al., 2005; Kelley et al., 2005). Functional imaging research in humans has also highlighted the role of these regions in food processing (Small, 2002; Killgore et al., 2003; DelParigi et al., 2007). However, critical questions remained unanswered.Previous demonstrations of independent regional effects do not address potentially important interactions that occur in the neural network implicated in processing foods. The change in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response in any brain region is the result of inputs from multiple brain sources and intracortical processing in that area (Logothetis et al., 2001; Goense and Logothetis, 2008). In contrast, connectivity analysis examines the interaction between pairs of specific brain regions. Here, we used psychophysiological interaction (PPI) to address how the physiological connectivity (coupling) between pairs of regions is affected by psychological context (e.g., viewing appetizing vs bland foods) (Friston et al., 1997). Of particular relevance, recent work in rats examining the correlation between brain regions expressing \u201cimmediate early gene and proenkephalin\u201d (measures of neuronal metabolism) indicates that the connectivity between the amygdala, ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens core) and prefrontal cortex is modulated when animals are exposed to contextual cues associated with appetizing food (Schiltz et al., 2007). These regions are directly anatomically interconnected (Kunishio and Haber, 1994; Friedman et al., 2002; Haber et al., 2006; Barbas, 2007; Ghashghaei et al., 2007). Hence, a formal analysis of their connectivity in humans in response to viewing foods, and the modulation of this connectivity by the EFS personality trait, could provide new insights into the neural basis of vulnerability to obesity.We investigated these issues using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to focus on the neural correlates of viewing appetizing compared with bland foods in healthy volunteers. Our main hypothesis was that the connectivity in the feeding network identified by animal research would be regulated by the interactive effects of viewing appetizing (relative to bland) foods and individual variability in EFS. To directly test this hypothesis, we studied PPI using general linear models (GLMs) of fMRI data.Twenty-one right-handed healthy volunteers with normal or corrected to normal vision completed the study for payment (10 females; age range, 19\u201339; mean age, 25.3 years; mean intelligence quotient, 119.8; SD, 21.6; mean body mass index, 24; SD, 4.6). Participants were nonsmokers with no neurological or psychiatric history, including eating disorders. The study was approved by the local ethics committee, and subjects provided written informed consent. Subjects fasted for at least 2 h before the fMRI session and completed the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ) which assesses EFS (van Strien et al., 1986). The DEBQ also assesses two additional factors implicated in obesity that are not specifically related to external food cues: overeating in response to emotional distress (DEBQ-emotional) and the tendency to suddenly abandon an intense dieting regime (DEBQ-restrained) (van Strien et al., 1986). In addition, participants completed the Spielberger State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger et al., 1983) and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D scale) (Sawyer-Radloff, 1977) to exclude any confounding effect by other personality factors associated with overeating as a result of emotional distress. Before and after scanning, subjects also completed the \u201chunger questionnaire,\u201d a self-report measure of subjective hunger (Friedman et al., 1999).During scanning, subjects viewed full-color photographs of foods consistently identified as highly appetizing (e.g., chocolate cake, ice cream) or bland (e.g., rice, potatoes) (Fig. 1). There were 30 exemplars of each class. Stimuli were selected from ratings made by a different group of individuals ( = 12). Ratings were made on a Likert scale (from 1 to 7) and indicated the degree to which each stimulus was pleasant, appetizing, and arousing. Mean ratings for the stimuli used are shown in supplemental Table 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material. Wilcoxon's signed rank tests showed that appetizing foods were rated as significantly more pleasant and appetizing than bland foods ( < 0.005). Stimulus categories did not differ significantly on ratings of arousal ( > 0.05). All photographs were presented via an angled mirror above the subjects' eyes, which reflected back-projected images from a translucent screen in the bore of the magnet behind the subject's head. Stimuli were presented in alternating 21 s epochs each containing six food images from one category (either appetizing or bland) intermixed with six null events. A total of 18 epochs of each category were presented. The transition between the 21 s epochs was not signaled, each food stimulus was repeated on average 3.5 times, and the identity of the repeated images was counterbalanced across subjects.fMRI paradigm and examples of stimuli used. Subjects were shown alternating 21 s epochs containing pictures of either appetizing or bland foods (18 epochs of each). Each epoch comprised six food trials interspersed with six null events. See Materials and Methods for a full description of the paradigm.Each \u201cfood trial\u201d comprised a 1000 ms presentation of a photograph (either appetizing or bland food) followed by a low contrast central cross (750 ms). The food photographs subtended horizontal and vertical visual angles of \u223c11 and 10\u00b0, respectively. Each image was displaced by \u223c0.8 degrees to the left or right of center, and subjects were asked to indicate its position by making a two-choice (left/right) button response within the 1750 ms trial duration. Null events constituted a 1750 ms presentation of the same low contrast central cross. The stimuli during each epoch were pseudorandomized with respect to trial type (food trial or null event), such that no more than three consecutive trials were of the same format (food trial or null event). Pseudorandomization enhanced design efficiency while preserving the unpredictability of stimulus onsets in naive subjects. The total experiment duration was 12 min and 36 s.MRI scanning was performed on a 3-Tesla Tim Trio (Siemens) with a head coil gradient set at the Medical Research Council, Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit. Whole-brain data were acquired with echo-planar T2*-weighted imaging (EPI), sensitive to the BOLD signal contrast (46 coronal slices, 3 mm thickness; repetition time, 2800 ms; echo time, 30 ms; flip angle, 78\u00b0; field of view, 192 mm; voxel size, 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm). The first three volumes were discarded to allow for equilibration effects. T1-weighted structural images were acquired at a resolution of 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm. Data were analyzed using statistical parametric mapping 5 (SPM5) software (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/). The EPI images were since interpolated in time to correct for slice time differences and realigned to the first scan by rigid body transformations to correct for head movements. The mean EPI was computed for each subject and inspected to ensure that none showed excessive signal dropout in medial temporal and ventral anterior cingulate cortices (ACCs). EPI and structural images were coregistered and normalized to the standard template in MNI space (Montreal Neurological Institute\u2013International Consortium for Brain Mapping) using linear and nonlinear transformations and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of full-width at half-maximum 8 mm.This analysis was used to functionally define the MNI reference coordinates for the ventral striatum and amygdala which were used as \u201csource\u201d regions for the PPI connectivity analyses. Another aim was to verify that the viewing appetizing relative to bland foods elicits the previously reported food processing neural network (Small, 2002; Killgore et al., 2003; DelParigi et al., 2007).A random effects model was implemented using a two-stage process (first and second level).This random-effects analysis allows inferences about the general population from which subjects were drawn. For each subject we used a GLM to assess regionally specific effects of task parameters on BOLD indices of activation (Friston et al., 1994). The model included two experimental factors (appetizing and bland food presentation), effects of no interest (null events), and the realignment parameters to account for residual motion-related variance. Low-frequency signal drift was removed using a high-pass filter (cutoff 128 s) and autoregressive(1) modeling of temporal autocorrelations was applied.All events (appetizing, bland, and null) were modeled by \u03b4 functions convolved by the hemodynamic response function (HRF). The \u03b2-weight derived from the GLM therefore reflects the average response to all events of a given type. Because we used the canonical HRF, the mean peak activation after an event is directly proportional to the \u03b2-weight. Null events acted as a baseline and enhanced food stimulus related variance in regional BOLD signal. This increases the power of subsequent connectivity analysis. From the first-level analyses, we generated contrast images for appetizing versus bland foods. These are contrast images (of the voxel-wise differences in \u03b2-estimates for appetizing and bland foods) but not statistical images. The second-level analysis of the group used these contrast images in a new GLM from which we generated statistical images, SPM{t} maps. With balanced designs at the first level (i.e., similar events for each subject, in similar numbers), this second-level analysis closely approximates a true mixed effects design, with both within and between subjects variance.The 21 contrast images from individual subjects' first-level analyses were entered into second-level models to explore the main effect of the appetizing versus bland contrast in the whole group (one sample  test) and to identify any effect of the psychometric measures (any DEBQ, anxiety, and depression score) on the isolated brain responses for the same contrast (regression models).The first-level (single subject) data were not statistically thresholded before inclusion in the second level. Two approaches to threshold second-level maps were applied. First, for small volume corrections (svc) regarding previous hypotheses in specific regions of interest (ROIs), the threshold was set at  < 0.05 family-wise error (FWE) (Worsley et al., 1996; Friston, 1997). Because brain regions might be very different in size (in particular subcortical compared with cortical areas), we treated them as separate hypotheses and adjust the significance for multiple hypotheses testing using Dunn\u2013Sidak correction for multiple tests (Howell, 2007). The amygdala, striatum, premotor, and ACC were defined as a priori ROIs based on the animal and human literature showing their key role in feeding behavior and in processing reward stimuli such as foods (Rolls et al., 1980; LaBar et al., 2001; Ehrsson et al., 2003; Killgore et al., 2003; Dresel et al., 2005; Haber et al., 2006; Killgore and Yurgelun-Todd, 2006; Alonso-Alonso and Pascual-Leone, 2007; Berthoud, 2007; Cornier et al., 2007; DelParigi et al., 2007; Schiltz et al., 2007; Berthoud and Morrison, 2008). All ROIs were defined using the Marsbar software incorporating the \u201caal.02\u201d atlas for automatic anatomical labeling (http://marsbar.sourceforge.net/) (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002). Second, we report other regions which were not predicted but met a threshold of  < 0.001, uncorrected, 10 contiguous voxels as defined functionally, by their suprathreshold  values.The physiological connectivity between two brain regions can vary with the psychological context (Friston et al., 1997). Here, we were interested in connectivity that is modulated by the context of viewing appetizing versus bland foods. This constitutes a PPI (Friston et al., 1997). We sought to identify \u201ctarget\u201d regions that showed differential connectivity according to the context (appetizing vs bland) with each of two source regions (the ventral striatum and the amygdala) consistently implicated in feeding and food reward by animal and human research (Rolls et al., 1980; Nishijo et al., 1988; Masuda et al., 1997; Baldo et al., 2005; Balleine and Killcross, 2006; O'Doherty et al., 2006); the amygdala and ventral striatum have also been implicated in other types of rewards such as money (Knutson and Bossaerts, 2007) and positive feedback (Cools et al., 2002). We also explored any connectivity pattern arising from the ventral ACC, given its wider role in emotion regulation (Davidson et al., 2000; Ochsner and Gross, 2005; Delgado et al., 2008) and extinction (Phelps et al., 2004; Delgado et al., 2008) (supplemental material, available at www.jneurosci.org). The ventral ACC was identified using the same contrast used to locate the amygdala and ventral striatum source regions.Using PPI, regions are not identified because their activity is correlated with activation in the source region or the presence/absence of appetizing foods but rather because of the interaction between these two variables. More specifically, we sought to identify target regions for which the change in connectivity with the source region varied as a function of EFS. We refer to this latter analysis examining the interaction with ESF as a \u201chigher-order PPI.\u201dSeparate connectivity analyses (PPIs) were carried out, using the ventral striatum, amygdala, and ventral ACC regions from the whole-group analysis as the sources in each (supplemental Figs. 1, 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). The PPI analyses used the same basic procedure, so it is described for the ventral striatum PPI alone. For each subject, we computed the appetizing versus bland food contrast to determine the local maximum that was the nearest voxel to the activation peak in the ventral striatum defined by the whole-group activation clusters (Table 1). Next, 10 mm spheres were constructed around the subject-specific local maximum and the time series for each subject computed using the first eigenvariate from all voxels' time series. Using this approach, the center of the ventral striatum for each subject was the most significant voxel. This meant that the centers of the spheres were slightly different across subjects; thus, we also used a standardized approach using the same 10 mm spheres for all subjects (centers for all subjects in the ventral striatum: MNI,  = 6,  = 6,  = \u22124; in the amygdala: MNI,  = \u221230,  = 2,  = \u221220; and in the ventral ACC: MNI,  = \u221212,  = 36,  = \u22126 which are all the maximal voxels for the appetizing vs bland food contrast) (Table 1). Regardless of the approach used to extract the time series in the source regions, we obtained highly consistent results [supplemental Results (available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), Analysis of connectivity: PPIs using the same center of the sphere in the source regions for all subjects].Main effect of appetizing versus bland food presentation ( = 21, one-sample  test on regional BOLD response)The BOLD time series for each subject was deconvolved to estimate a \u201cneuronal time series\u201d for the source region, using the PPI-deconvolution parameter defaults in SPM5 (Gitelman et al., 2003). The psychophysiological interaction term (PPI regressor) was calculated as the element-by-element product of the ventral striatum neuronal time series and a vector coding for the main effect of task (1 for appetizing foods, \u22121 for bland foods, and 0 for null events). This product was reconvolved by the canonical HRF. The model also included the main effects of task convolved by the HRF, the neuronal time series for each source, and the movement regressors as effects of no interest. Subject-specific PPI models were run, and contrast images were generated for positive and negative PPIs. The identified regions had greater or lesser coupling with the source regions according to the context of appetizing versus bland food presentation.The 21 first-level contrast images were then entered into second-level GLM analyses for the contrast of interest (appetizing vs bland), and SPM{t}maps were generated using Gaussian Random Field theory to make statistical inferences (Friston et al., 1994). The following contrasts were assessed: (1) brain regions that showed changes in connectivity with the source regions for the appetizing versus bland foods context (regardless of variations in any psychometric score) (one sample  test); (2) regions for which the change in connectivity with the source region (after appetizing vs bland food context) were correlated with the individual variation in external food sensitivity (regression model). Correlations with other scales from the DEBQ (DEBQ-emotional, and DEBQ-restrain) and with anxiety and depression scores were also investigated (regression models). The second-level models also all included subjects' change in hunger across the experiment (i.e., difference between self-assessed hunger score before and after the scanning session) as a covariate of no interest to remove possible confounding effects of this variable. The same two approaches reported before were used to statistically threshold maps.Subjects' scores on the EFS and other DEBQ scales were as follows: external food sensitivity (DEBQ-external): range 23\u201347, mean = 34.4, SD = 6.3; DEBQ-emotional: range 16\u201353, mean = 34, SD = 11.2; DEBQ-restrain, range 10\u201342, mean = 23.3, SD = 9.7. Scores on the Hunger Questionnaire before (and after) scanning were as follows: range 9 (16) to 34 (43), mean 24.1 (29.9), SD = 6.8 (7.16). Subjects' scores on other personality dimensions were as follows: trait anxiety: range 21\u201352, mean = 36.52, SD = 8.39; state anxiety: range 20\u201343, mean = 30.71, SD = 6.76; depression (CES-D): range 1\u201324, mean = 11, SD = 6.20.EFS was positively correlated with the change in participants' hunger scores (hunger score after scanning minus hunger score before) ( = 0.39;  = 0.03; one-tailed), but critically showed no correlation with levels of hunger before scanning ( > 0.3). Thus, people who were more sensitive to external food-related cues (high EFS) presented a greater increase in their subjective level of hunger after viewing pictures of appetizing foods. Because EFS can operate in the absence of \u201cinternal\u201d homeostatic signals of hunger (van Strien et al., 1986; Burton et al., 2007), we excluded any contribution of \u201cchange-in-hunger,\u201d by including this as a covariate of no interest in the PPI analyses (see Materials and Methods). Remarkably similar results to those reported were found even when the change-in-hunger covariate was not included (supplemental Results, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material); thus, it cannot account for the effects of EFS we observed. There were also no significant correlations between EFS and any other DEBQ or personality measure, nor between the EFS and the body mass index (BMI) s < 0.09, s > 0.34. Hence, the effects of EFS cannot be attributed to these other variables.Task accuracy to indicate the position of each food picture in the visual display was high for both appetizing (mean accuracy, 96.7%; SD, 2.6) and bland (mean accuracy, 94.8%; SD, 3.1) food presentation ((20) = 1.02;  = 0.31), with no significant correlations with EFS or other DEBQ or personality scales, hunger scores or BMI (s < 0.07; s > 0.38).The whole-group analysis (regardless of individual differences in any personality measure) identified a group of regions showing an increased BOLD response to appetizing compared with bland foods that included the ventral striatum, the amygdala, and the ventral ACC (Table 1; supplemental Figs. 1, 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Moreover, the task evoked activations in brain regions previously implicated in food processing (Small, 2002; Killgore et al., 2003; DelParigi et al., 2007).When we assessed any significant modulation by either the EFS or by any other DEBQ or personality scale (DEBQ-emotional, DEBQ-restrain, trait/state anxiety, depression) on the isolated brain BOLD responses for the same contrast (appetizing vs bland foods), none of the ROIs met the criteria for statistical significance. The only region outside our a priori ROIs that showed a positive correlation with the external food sensitivity was the anterior superior temporal sulcus ( = 56,  = 4,  = \u221218;  = 4.57;  < 0.001, uncorrected;  = 0.72;  < 0.001).In the same way that interactions and main effects are statistically distinct, the interactive influence of EFS on any change in connectivity from viewing appetizing relative to bland foods is also distinct from any overall effect regardless of EFS. First we examined the latter PPIs. The PPIs showing a change in connectivity with the ventral striatum (source region) across all subjects demonstrated no statistically significant effects in our a priori ROIs. However, the whole-brain analysis showed that the frontal pole ( = \u221232,  = 46,  = 10;  = 4.37;  < 0.0001, uncorrected) and the posterior parietal cortex ( = \u221246,  = \u221254,  = 44;  = 4.74;  < 0.0001, uncorrected) showed changes in connectivity with the ventral striatum as a function of the psychological context (appetizing vs bland food). No statistically significant PPIs in our a priori ROIs were found in the whole-group analysis (i.e., regardless of any personality measures) using the amygdala as the source region (even at  < 0.01, uncorrected). Furthermore, no additional regions outside these ROIs met the criteria for statistical significance ( < 0.001, uncorrected).For the analysis in which the ventral striatum was the source region, EFS strongly modulated the change in connectivity between the ventral striatum and amygdala, to the sight of appetizing versus bland foods ( = \u221226,  = \u22124,  = \u221216;  = 6.33;  < 0.0001, FWE svc;  = 0.79;  < 0.001) (Fig. 2), and similarly between the ventral striatum and an area of the premotor cortex involved in the preparation of orofacial movements ( = 56,  = 0,  = 36;  = 4.51;  < 0.05, FWE svc;  = 0.66;  < 0.001) (Fig. 2) (Ehrsson et al., 2003; Dresel et al., 2005). In both cases, EFS was positively correlated with the change in connectivity ranging from more negative values in low EFS to less negative values in high EFS individuals. A change in connectivity between the ventral striatum and the dorsal ACC was also correlated with EFS ( = \u22122,  = 28,  = 20;  = 6.01;  < 0.002, FWE svc;  = \u22120.78;  < 0.001) (Fig. 2), but here the correlation was negative (more positive values in low EFS, and less positive values in high EFS).Higher-order PPI from the ventral striatum (source region). , When viewing appetizing versus bland foods, EFS was positively correlated with the change in connectivity between the ventral striatum and the amygdala. , When viewing appetizing versus bland foods, EFS was positively correlated with the change in connectivity between the ventral striatum and the orofacial region of the premotor cortex. , When viewing appetizing versus bland foods, EFS was negatively correlated with the change in connectivity between the ventral striatum and the dorsal ACC. Color bars represent  statistics. FWE, svc. The  and  coordinates are in MNI space. The regression lines (black) and the 95% confidence intervals (red lines) are shown. , Number of subjects. Activations are shown at the thresholded  < 0.001, uncorrected.For the analysis in which the amygdala was the source region, EFS was negatively correlated with the change in connectivity between the amygdala and both the ventral ACC ( = 0,  = 26,  = \u22126;  = 4.54;  < 0.02, FWE svc;  = \u22120.58;  < 0.005) (Fig. 3) and the dorsal ACC ( = \u22122,  = 24,  = 22;  = 4.05;  < 0.05, FWE svc;  = \u22120.59;  < 0.004) (Fig. 3). In both cases, the range of the connectivity changes was from more positive values in low EFS to less positive values in high EFS individuals. We can therefore conclude that in high EFS people there is a reduction in the change in connectivity (regardless of the sign of the changes) between specific \u201cfeeding\u201d brain areas when viewing appetizing versus bland food. It is also of interest that the dorsal ACC region identified in this latter analysis using the amygdala as the source, showed a considerable overlap with a similar area identified in the previous analysis using the ventral striatum as the source (Fig. 4). A summary of all higher-order PPIs is shown in Figure 5. A whole-brain analysis showed no other regions with EFS-dependent differential connectivity with either the ventral striatum or amygdala ( < 0.001, uncorrected).Higher-order PPI from the amygdala (source region; see Results and Subjects and Methods). , When viewing appetizing versus bland foods, EFS was negatively correlated with the change in connectivity between the amygdala and the ventral ACC. , When viewing appetizing versus bland foods, EFS was negatively correlated with the change in connectivity between the amygdala and the dorsal ACC. Color bars represent  statistics. FWE, svc. The  coordinates are in MNI space. The regression lines (black) and the 95% confidence intervals (red lines) are shown. , Number of subjects. Activations are shown at the thresholded  < 0.001, uncorrected.The dorsal ACC identified in the higher-order PPI analysis (negative correlation) from the ventral striatum (as source region) strongly overlaps with the dorsal ACC identified in the higher-order PPI analysis (negative correlation) from the amygdala as source region.Summary of the higher-order PPI from the ventral striatum and the amygdala source regions. EFS was positively correlated with the connectivity between the amygdala and the ventral striatum, attributed to the emotional and motivational states evoked by the sight of appetizing foods (red solid line). A similar correlation was found with the change in connectivity between the ventral striatum and the orofacial region of premotor cortex that might enable the preparation of motor acts necessary for eating. EFS also show negative correlations with the change in connectivity between the dorsal and ventral ACC and the amygdala and between the dorsal ACC and the ventral striatum (red dotted lines), interpreted as altered prefrontal\u2013limbic interactions. Note also that connections shown indicate changes in connectivity as a function of both viewing appetizing versus bland food and of the external food sensitivity but do not necessarily represent anatomical pathways.The PPIs discussed thus far are all indictors of differential connectivity under different contexts. We also examined the average connectivity, pooled over both psychological contexts (i.e., collapsing the appetizing and bland conditions) for each pair of source and target regions identified by higher-order PPIs. As shown in supplemental Figure 4, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material, no correlations were found between the EFS and the average connectivity. In other words, high EFS subjects do not have intrinsically different coupling between the regions of interest (pooled across all food types). This demonstrates that it is only the change in connectivity induced by viewing appetizing versus bland food that is associated with the EFS.Finally, PPIs arising from the ventral striatum and amygdala were not correlated with the DEBQ-emotional and DEBQ-restrained scales or with other measures of emotional behavior (depression, and state or trait anxiety) (no suprathreshold voxels at  < 0.001, uncorrected). This highlights the specificity of the EFS in capturing individual differences in the change in brain connectivity related to processing external food cues.In all reported analyses, source region data from the ventral striatum and amygdala were extracted using subject-specific peak foci (see Subjects and Methods). However, the results were replicated with a different approach, using a standard coordinate for each of the ventral striatum and amygdala for all subjects (supplemental Results, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).The fact that connectivity between components of the feeding network (Kelley et al., 2005; Schiltz et al., 2007; Berthoud and Morrison, 2008) were only fully identified by the EFS regression analyses accords with the role of EFS in responsivity to external food cues (van Strien et al., 1986; Burton et al., 2007; Elfhag et al., 2007, 2008). In other words, the large variance in the change of connectivity is accounted for by individual differences in EFS, with relative decreases as a function of EFS.We have shown that specific connections in the human brain are differentially affected by EFS, a factor associated with overeating and increased preference for appetizing foods (Braet and Van Strien, 1997; Elfhag et al., 2008), while subjects viewed appetizing compared with bland foods. High EFS was associated with reduced differential connectivity in a network that shows striking similarities with one implicated in feeding behavior by animal research, including the ventral striatum, amygdala, medial prefrontal, and premotor cortices (Kelley et al., 2005).Work in rats has shown that exposure to external contextual cues associated with highly palatable foods alters connectivity between very similar components of the feeding network (Schiltz et al., 2007). Our current findings demonstrate an analogous effect in humans that is critically dependent on EFS. We therefore suggest that individual differences in EFS constitute the behavioral expression of variation in network coupling among neural structures implicated in feeding.EFS also correlated with subjects' change in hunger before and after viewing pictures of foods. However, it is important to note that the connectivity results were found despite factoring out this change. This accords with the observation that high EFS can affect overeating in the absence of hunger (van Strien et al., 1986), and animal research demonstrating that the network we have identified reflects the rewarding/hedonic aspects of food processing (Berthoud and Morrison, 2008). Consistent with this interpretation, a large sample study has shown that increased EFS is associated with increased preference for the sort of high calorie, sweet foods used in our stimulus set (Elfhag et al., 2008). Here, we suggest that this might operate by affecting connections between components of the \u201cfeeding network.\u201dAlthough PPIs do not indicate the direction of influences, anatomical research demonstrates connections from the amygdala to ventral striatum but not vice versa (Russchen et al., 1985; Friedman et al., 2002). In accord with this, the overeating induced by the stimulation of \u03bc-opioid receptors in the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens) is blocked by the inactivation of the amygdala, demonstrating that the latter is a critical source of food-related inputs to the ventral striatum (Will et al., 2004; Baldo et al., 2005). Moreover, a recent study in animals showed that the amygdala response to reward-predictive cues precedes that of the ventral striatum (Ambroggi et al., 2008). Hence, connectivity between the amygdala and ventral striatum operates in one specific direction. A reasonable question is why the PPI analyses identified the amygdala from the ventral striatum but not vice versa. There are different possible explanations for this. First, the construction of the PPI terms from ventral striatum and the amygdala might be asymmetrical because of differences in the convolved hemodynamic response functions. Second, the statistical significance of PPIs from the amygdala and the ventral striatum might differ given the different residual error terms in the two regions. However, in accord with anatomical evidence and previous comparative research, it is reasonable to conclude that the pathway from the amygdala to the ventral striatum is a critical route in mediating the individual sensitivity to hedonic aspects of external food cues.The ventral and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (v/dACC) is strongly anatomically connected with ventral striatum and amygdala (Kunishio and Haber, 1994; Ghashghaei et al., 2007). Researchers in comparative neuroscience have proposed that these connections modulate the response of the ventral striatum and amygdala to appetizing foods and other rewarding stimuli (Haber et al., 2006). The negative correlation between the change in the dACC\u2013ventral striatum connectivity and v/dACC\u2013amygdala connectivity as a function of EFS might therefore represent altered prefrontal\u2013limbic interactions during the processing of hedonic and rewarding aspects of foods (Berthoud, 2007).Anatomical evidence showing projections from ACC to ventral striatum, but not vice versa (Kunishio and Haber, 1994; Haber and McFarland, 1999; Haber et al., 2006), allow us to infer the directionality of the prefrontal and ventral striatum interactions. However, in the case of connectivity between the v/dACC and the amygdala, anatomical projections are bidirectional (although vACC sends more projections to amygdala than it receives and vice versa for dACC) (Ghashghaei et al., 2007), and we would not wish to exclude potential contributions of connections from the amygdala to prefrontal cortex.Furthermore, EFS negatively correlated with the change in connectivity between the vACC and a \u201cgustatory\u201d region of the orbitofrontal cortex (Small et al., 2007) (supplemental material, available at www.jneurosci.org), also implicated in coding the rewarding value of food (O'Doherty, 2004). These interactions accord with the ACC's wider role in extinction of negative emotions (Phelps et al., 2004; Delgado et al., 2008), emotion regulation through cognitive strategies (Ochsner et al., 2004), resolution of emotional conflict (Etkin et al., 2006; Egner et al., 2008), and pain modulation (Ploghaus et al., 2003).It is also of note that prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysfunction has been proposed as a key factor in obesity (Alonso-Alonso and Pascual-Leone, 2007). For example, diffuse hypoperfusion of the PFC has been described in overeating conditions, such as the Kleine\u2013Levine syndrome (Arias et al., 2002), and the hyperphagic behavior observed in patients with degenerative dementia has been shown to positively correlate with the right PFC atrophy (Whitwell et al., 2007).The PPI using the ventral striatum as source region also identified a change in connectivity with the orofacial regions of premotor cortex which might be explained by the existence of both direct and indirect (via ventral tegmental area) anatomical pathways (Draganski et al., 2008) (see also Joel, 2001). The premotor/motor cortices also form part of animal models of feeding and may mediate the transformation of the desire to eat (generated by the ventral striatum after inputs from the amygdala) into the preparation of acts necessary for eating (Kelley et al., 2005).An additional point should be noted. Changes in connectivity were identified by the regression analyses with EFS and not the main effects, emphasizing the importance of this variable in accounting for the wide range of between-subject variance. Similarly, a number of previous fMRI studies have shown correlations with relevant personality variables in a priori regions in the absence of main effects (Bishop et al., 2004; Canli, 2004; Beaver et al., 2006).In the current study, variation in EFS was not confounded by differences in body mass index and the neurohormonal dysregulation associated with established obesity. However, it is important to emphasize that increased EFS is associated with overeating and, together with genetic, environmental and other personality risk factors, operate to promote obesity. Studying EFS in the absence of obesity unconfounds these variables. To this extent, we adopt an analogous approach to the investigation of genetic risk factors in disease by demonstrating the effect of a personality trait (rather than a single genetic variant) on a key biological pathway implicated in the disorder (K\u00f6rner et al., 2008; Li and Loos, 2008).Structural equation modeling of behavioral data has shown that the relationship between EFS and overeating is mediated by food craving (Burton et al., 2007). In addition, converging evidence shows that the craving for food shown by obese individuals shares many similarities with the loss of control and compulsive behavior associated with drug craving displayed by addicted subjects, and the same brain regions (amygdala, striatum, and v/dACC) have been identified for both (Wang et al., 2004a,b, 2006). Similarly, the amygdala and ventral striatum have also been implicated in processing other rewards including money (Knutson and Bossaerts, 2007) or positive feedback (Cools et al., 2002).Finally, we emphasize that high EFS individuals displayed a reduction in the change of connectivity between specific brain regions of the feeding network. This decreased or \u201cless efficient\u201d connectivity is analogous to the reductions in connectivity between regions implicated in aggression in anger-prone individuals (Passamonti et al., 2008) and to the more extreme finding of absent connectivity in psychiatric disorders of aggression (Coccaro et al., 2007), generalized anxiety (Monk et al., 2008), schizophrenia (Fakra et al., 2008), and antisocial behavior (Marsh et al., 2008). Together, these findings provide evidence that less efficient connectivity among relevant brain regions might represent a \u201cneuronal marker\u201d for increased vulnerability to develop abnormal behaviors, including food craving and overeating.Our study reveals how people with high EFS show altered brain connectivity to the sight of appetizing versus bland food. EFS correlated with the change in connectivity between brain regions implicated in motivational aspects of food processing and in emotional regulation. Identification of this relationship provides the critical link between studies of personality traits underlying obesity and the neurobiology of feeding. Our results are also particularly pertinent to recent concerns regarding the power of food advertisements to promote food intake and preferences. In addition, they demonstrate the potential value of individual differences in personality to the developing field of \u201cpersonalized medicine\u201d (Kumar and Ajilore, 2008).This work was supported by the Medical Research Council under project code U.1055.02.001.00001.01 (A.J.C.).

This study addresses the question by relating anatomical measurements of Heschl's gyrus (HG), the structure containing human primary auditory cortex, to how this region processes temporal and spectral acoustic information. In this study, subjects' right and left HG were identified and manually indicated on anatomical magnetic resonance imaging scans. Volumes of gray matter, white matter, and total gyrus were recorded, and asymmetry indices were calculated. Additionally, cortical auditory activity in response to noise stimuli varying orthogonally in temporal and spectral dimensions was assessed and related to the volumetric measurements. A high degree of anatomical variability was seen, consistent with other reports in the literature. The auditory cortical responses showed the expected leftward lateralization to varying rates of stimulus change and rightward lateralization of increasing spectral information. An explicit link between auditory structure and function is then established, in which anatomical variability of auditory cortex is shown to relate to individual differences in the way that cortex processes acoustic information. Specifically, larger volumes of left HG were associated with larger extents of rate-related cortex on the left, and larger volumes of right HG related to larger extents of spectral-related cortex on the right. This finding is discussed in relation to known microanatomical asymmetries of HG, including increased myelination of its fibers, and implications for language learning are considered.The question of how normal variation in brain anatomy relates to differences in brain function is fundamental in the field of neuroscience and intrigues neuroscientists, psychologists, and philosophers alike. Human auditory cortex provides an excellent model system in which to investigate these relationships because there are established interhemispheric differences in both structure and function, but direct relationships have been elusive [but see Schneider et al. (2002, 2005)]. This study examines the structure\u2013function question in the context of basic building blocks of language (rapid acoustic changes) and music (complex frequency information). Although both speech and music recruit neural systems distributed throughout the brain (Tervaniemi and Hugdahl, 2003; Hickok and Poeppel, 2007), the spectrotemporal trade-off model of acoustic processing states that functional lateralization of acoustic encoding contributes to the leftward-lateralizing elements of language and the rightward-lateralizing elements of music (Zatorre et al., 2002). This model is based on studies showing enhanced sensitivity to rapid acoustic changes in left auditory cortex (Li\u00e9geois-Chauvel et al., 1999; Zatorre and Belin, 2001; Sch\u00f6nwiesner et al., 2005; Jamison et al., 2006) and preferential processing of complex spectral information in right auditory cortex (Zatorre, 1988; Johnsrude et al., 2000; Li\u00e9geois-Chauvel et al., 2001; Patterson et al., 2002).Structurally, a number of studies have shown leftward asymmetries in the volume of Heschl's gyrus (HG), the location of human primary auditory cortex (Morosan et al., 2001). This asymmetry is largely attributable to greater white matter volumes, likely related to a greater number of fibers and/or increased myelination (Penhune et al., 1996; Anderson et al., 1999; Chance et al., 2006). The spectrotemporal trade-off model proposes that microstructural properties may underlie observed hemispheric differences in auditory processing, in that greater myelination and connectivity in left auditory cortex may underlie that region's specialization for handling fast temporal information. Conversely, denser, more interconnected columnar structure in right auditory cortex appears more conducive to evaluating fine frequency distinctions (Seldon, 1981, 1982; Anderson et al., 1999; Sigalovsky et al., 2006). However, a relationship between cortical structure and acoustic processing has never been directly established.Here, we used structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess the relationship between the volume of auditory cortex and its functional response to spectrally and temporally varying auditory stimuli. We used a well established protocol to label and measure HG volumes from structural MRI scans and adapted a well controlled stimulus set consisting of amplitude-modulated noise bands varying orthogonally in their temporal modulation rate and number of spectral components to assess auditory cortical responses (Sch\u00f6nwiesner et al., 2005). We tested the hypotheses that variance in HG asymmetry and/or volume of left HG (LHG) across individuals would predict the response to increasing rate of temporal change, and variance in HG asymmetry and/or volume of right HG (RHG) would relate to the response to increasing spectral density.Twelve normal right-handed adults with no history of neurological problems participated in this study (7 female, 5 male, average age 27). Handedness was verified with the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldfield, 1971). Normal and symmetric hearing was verified through an audiologic exam. After preprocessing the functional data, it was noted that one subject's data had severe motion artifact, and another dataset had an unacceptably low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), leaving 10 useable datasets. All scanning was performed on a 3T Siemens Trio scanner fitted with an eight-channel headcoil.Anatomical scans were collected as T1-weighted whole-brain three-dimensional volumes (magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo) with a repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) of 2100 ms/2.4 ms, flip angle (FA) of 15\u00b0, and an inversion time of 1100 ms. Matrix size was 256 \u00d7 256, field of view (FOV) 22 cm, and slice thickness 1 mm, with a resolution of 0.86 \u00d7 0.86 \u00d7 1.0 mm. Sequence parameters were optimized for the 3T Trio system.BIST (Brain Imaging Software Toolbox) was used for all processing of the anatomical data (McConnell Brain Imaging Center at the Montreal Neurological Institute). T1 volumes were preprocessed to maintain any morphological distinctions between participants and across hemispheres within individual brains. They were normalized to a right/left symmetric template of standard stereotaxic space using only linear transformations to avoid warping of pertinent brain structures (Collins et al., 1994). All volumes were then corrected for intensity nonuniformities (Sled et al., 1998). The T1 volumes were randomly flipped in the left/right dimension before labeling by someone not involved in brain labeling so that labelers were blind to hemisphere and could not be biased by this knowledge.Right and left HG were identified and manually indicated on each subject's T1 volume as described in our previous work (Penhune et al., 1996, 2003; Wong et al., 2008). This system of landmarks and guidelines used for delineating HG on MRI scans was developed to give the best estimate of the location of primary auditory cortex from gross morphological features (Penhune et al., 1996). This definition was based on a postmortem study in which the location of primary auditory cortex was determined cytoarchitectonically and related to the gross morphology of the temporal lobe (Rademacher et al., 1993). The results of that study have been confirmed by a subsequent postmortem investigation that integrated cytoarchitectonic data and gross morphology in standardized stereotactic space (Morosan et al., 2001). Most importantly, the location of primary auditory cortex identified from gross anatomical landmarks in the Penhune et al. (1996) study overlapped almost entirely with the average location of primary auditory cortex as identified by cytoarchitecture in the Morosan study (Hall et al., 2002). Briefly, this definition includes the gyral region bounded anteriorly by the first transverse sulcus, and posteriorly by Heschl's sulcus. In the cases when a sulcus intermedius was present, if that sulcus extended at least half the length of the gyrus, it was considered a gyral duplication. In this case, the sulcus intermedius was extended in a straight line to the gyral base, and the gyrus anterior to the sulcus intermedius was taken as HG. If the sulcus intermedius extended less than half the length of the gyrus, it was not considered a gyral duplication, and Heschl's sulcus formed the posterior boundary. For common-stem duplications (one instance in this dataset), we painted two labels. In one label, we extended Heschl's sulcus in a straight line to the base of the stem and painted HG anterior to that line. For the second label, we included all of the first label plus the entire stem common to both gyri by extending a line perpendicular to Heschl's sulcus across the posterior gyrus and painting medially from that line to the base of the stem. We ran all statistics with gyral volumes from both of these labels, and the results did not differ. Values from the second label are shown. The software Display allowed simultaneous viewing of all three planes of section, a crucial advantage to performing these measurements accurately (Rademacher et al., 1993; MacDonald et al., 1994). This manual identification method allows us to capture individual variations in HG anatomy more fully than automatic methods permit. Labeled structures were automatically segmented into gray and white matter volumes (Collins et al., 1995). Gray and white matter and total gyral volumes were recorded, and asymmetry indices were calculated using the standard formula: asymmetry index (AI) = (L_volume \u2212 R_volume)/(L_volume + R_volume). Therefore, positive values indicate larger left volume. To illustrate this technique, Figure 1 shows left and right HG manually outlined on a representative T1 volume.A representative T1 volume is shown in coronal (top,  = \u221216) and axial (bottom,  = 8) sections. Left column, Original unmarked scan. Middle column, Location of manual HG labels in red. Right column, HG labels segmented into gray and white matter, shown in green and red, respectively. L, Left; R, right.Functional T2* images were obtained using echoplanar imaging (EPI), with each scan collecting 20 3-mm-thick slice images oriented parallel to the Sylvian fissure, covering the temporal lobes and surrounding area with a resolution of 3.44 \u00d7 3.44 \u00d7 3 mm (TE = 30 ms, FA = 90\u00b0, matrix size = 64 \u00d7 64, FOV 220 with 100% phase, acquisition time 1.2 s, EPI factor = 64). A sparse sampling technique with clustered image acquisition was used to ensure that any blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response related to loud scanning noises had diminished before the next scan took place (Belin et al., 1999; Hall et al., 1999; Wong et al., 2007). A TR of 8 s was used, with a delay of 6.8 s. Therefore, each trial's 1.2 s of scanning began 0.2 s before the end of the stimulus. Because the BOLD response corresponds to neural activity occurring seconds before the scan, this overlap did not affect the results. Scanner and stimulus presentation computers synchronized each trial via a trigger. All subjects wore custom headphones made out of ear defenders modified to allow auditory stimuli in through a hollow tube while decreasing the amount of scanner noise reaching the listener's ears by 30 dB. An acoustic blanket constructed of loaded vinyl and fiberglass matting (Singer Safety Company) was also placed firmly along the inside wall of the scanner's bore, further attenuating the scanner noise without any alteration of the MR signal. During a recent scanner upgrade, noise-reducing foam was inserted into the magnet case itself, substantially reducing the amount of noise output by the scanner during data acquisition.Stimuli based on M. Sch\u00f6nwiesner's Random Spectrogram Stimuli (Sch\u00f6nwiesner et al., 2005) were created in Matlab (The MathWorks) by orthogonally manipulating temporal and spectral parameters of a 7 s noise stimulus spanning 200\u20136000 Hz. This stimulus paradigm was carefully chosen for its ability to orthogonally vary temporal and spectral stimulus characteristics during a single fMRI trial. Stimuli were created by constructing a two-dimensional (time and frequency) random field spectrogram and converting it into sound. To create this spectrogram, the time window is divided into a specified number of bins of equal duration. Similarly, the frequency axis is divided into a specified number of bins of equal size based on the equivalent rectangular bandwidth (Moore and Glasberg, 1983). A random field is applied to the resulting time/frequency grid, with one number per spectrotemporal bin indicating intensity level. Then, 980 sine waves are fit to cover the spectrogram, with the level of each wave following the contour of the random field (see Fig. 2 for a schematic). By combining temporal and spectral bins into a single stimulus, the spectrogram appears as a checkerboard pattern, with blocks of various intensities. All stimuli have 5 ms on and off ramps, and are ramped 10 ms between intensity changes.Schematic of stimulus composition [adapted with permission from Sch\u00f6nwiesner et al. (2005)]. Stimuli of 1 s duration are depicted with time on the -axis and spectrum on the -axis. Actual stimuli were 7 s. Shades of gray denote signal intensity. , Depiction of a Base stimulus (far left) and its three orthogonal manipulations. Note that the three upper stimuli maintain three temporal bins but increase the number of spectral components. Similarly, the lower three stimuli maintain three frequency bins but increase the number of temporal bins. , A sound with a spectrogram equal to the random field is constructed by modulating the amplitude of the sine tone components (6 tones in this example; actual stimuli used 980 tones) with the random field values. The sine tones are then added to create the time-domain stimulus that is then converted to sound.A Base stimulus served as an anchor for both acoustic manipulations, with three large frequency bins of \u223c1.5 octaves that changed intensity at a rate of 3 Hz. The temporal manipulations produced three additional stimuli, each with increasing rates of change (5 Hz: Rate1, 10 Hz: Rate2, 33 Hz: Rate3), maintaining the frequency information in the Base stimulus. The spectral manipulations also produced three additional stimuli, each with decreasing sizes of frequency bins (6 bins of \u223c 981 cents each: Spect1, 30 bins of \u223c196 cents each: Spect2, and 294 bins of \u223c20 cents each: Spect3), maintaining the temporal information in the Base stimulus. A silent condition was included in which no stimulus was presented. Thirty tokens of each stimulus were created so that no exact stimulus was heard more than once. Level version 2.0 software was used to normalize all stimuli to equal dB RMS (Bob Tice and Tom Carrell, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE). Stimuli were presented binaurally through headphones at 90 dB sound pressure level (SPL) at a sampling rate of 22,050 Hz. Thirty trials of each of the eight conditions were presented in a pseudorandom order (same order for each subject, 240 total trials). Presentation order was calculated by OptSeq such that the same condition was not presented more than three times in a row (one occurrence) and each condition's stimulus trials are spread across the testing session. Subjects were requested to press a button each time they heard a stimulus to maintain alertness.SPM2 software was used for all preprocessing and analyses of fMRI data (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, University College London). Typical preprocessing steps were followed [motion correction, coregistration to T1, resampling into standardized space using the MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) EPI template, smoothed to full-width at half-maximum = 6 mm]. Additionally, for each functional volume, SNR was computed for each voxel (Parrish et al., 2000).The spectral density of the Spect3 condition (200\u20136000 Hz divided into 294 bins) was intended to challenge the spectral processing capabilities of the auditory system. However, the spectral bins of this condition appear to have been too dense to be processed discretely. The highest spectral condition used in the Sch\u00f6nwiesner et al. (2005) study on which the stimuli were modeled divided 200 Hz to 16 kHz into 16 bins. Within our Spect3 condition, the spectral density ranged from \u223c17 to 25 bins per critical band (Zwicker, 1961). For comparison, the spectral density of the Spect2 condition ranged from \u223c1.5 to 2.5 critical bands per spectral bin, and those of the Spect1 and Base conditions spanned critical bands, from \u223c2.5 to 6.5 critical bands per spectral bin. Additionally, the Spect3 stimulus was processed in a manner distinct from the responses to the other experimental conditions. It evoked a response considerably weaker than the Base condition, yet stronger than silence in all subjects. This response pattern is consistent with what one would expect from a noise stimulus containing a single spectral bin spanning the entire frequency range, e.g., white noise, and can be seen online in supplemental Figure 1 (available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). For these reasons, the Spect3 condition was not included in the analyses reported below.Covariation analyses identified voxels that increased activity with increasing rate of stimulus change or increasing spectral complexity. The BOLD response for each subject covarying with acoustic rate or spectral information was assessed using parameter number as a covariate: (1 = Base, 2 = Rate1, 3 = Rate2, 4 = Rate3) or (1 = Base, 2 = Spect1, 3 = Spect2). The resulting -statistic maps identify voxels in which the slope of the regression is significantly different from zero, meaning that those regions covary with rate of stimulus change or spectral complexity. A second-level analysis was performed on the individual covariation results to observe the effects at the group level.In a region of interest (ROI) analysis, individual activity levels were extracted for each condition within an ROI determined by the manually marked HG labels described above (right and left), providing a description of activity originating in auditory cortex including primary regions. For this analysis, a finite impulse response-based model including all conditions was created in SPM to determine the amount of BOLD activity associated with each condition for each subject. Marsbar software extracted ROI activity levels from this model (Brett et al., 2002).The literature on the anatomy of Heschl's gyrus indicates a highly variable morphology (Leonard et al., 1998; Morosan et al., 2001), and our dataset bore this out. Of the 20 gyri assessed in this study, nine gyral duplications were noted, with nearly equal incidence on right and left (five on left), a proportion of duplicate gyri consistent with previous reports [summarized by Penhune et al. (1996)]. All duplications on the right and one on the left were complete, indicated by a sulcus intermedius extending the length of the gyrus. Of the remaining left duplications, two were formed by a sulcus intermedius extending from the gyral base, leaving the lateral gyral ends fused, one had a sulcus intermedius that did not quite extend fully either medially or laterally, and one was formed by a sulcus intermedius that started at the lateral end of the gyri but did not extend to the gyral base, leaving the anterior and posterior gyri with a common stem. One rater labeled all gyri, and a second rater labeled 70% of them as a reliability check. Interrater reliability, calculated by correlating total HG volume across raters, was high (Pearson's  = 0.937). To directly compare our measurements to those published previously, we calculated normative ranges of volumes and asymmetry indices from a composite of all Penhune et al.'s published normal data (1996, experiments 1 and 2:  = 40; 2003, hearing subjects only:  = 10). No differences were found between our data and the Penhune data for left HG volume, right HG volume, or asymmetry index (independent sample  tests,  > 0.1 all comparisons), indicating our measurements are consistent with previously published reports. We found the typical HG asymmetry distribution with leftward asymmetry more common (Penhune et al., 1996; Chance et al., 2006). Of our 10 subjects, 5 were leftward asymmetric (AI > 0.1), 3 were rightward asymmetric (AI < \u22120.1), and 2 were symmetric (0.1 > AI > \u22120.1) (see Table 1). Asymmetries of gray and white matter, which always went in the same direction within subjects, were strongly correlated ( = 0.922,  < 0.001), although strength of asymmetry (absolute value of AI) was stronger for white than gray matter (paired  = 4.217,  < 0.005).Volumetric measurements in cubic millimeters of left and right white, gray, and total Heschl's gyrus, and the AI of total HG volumeBoth temporal and spectral covariation analyses revealed bilateral regions along the length of HG and onto planum temporale, including core and belt regions, showing increased BOLD activity in response to increasing rate of stimulus change and spectral complexity, respectively. The cortical areas covarying with rate of stimulus change overlapped areas seen in similar studies addressing functional lateralization of temporal auditory processing (Zatorre and Belin, 2001; Sch\u00f6nwiesner et al., 2005; Jamison et al., 2006) and included core and belt regions centered on HG (Sweet et al., 2005). In the temporal analysis, a larger region of significance was seen on the left, located more posteriorly than that on the right (7965 mm3 on left vs 5184 mm3 on right) (Fig. 3, Table 2). The region covarying with temporal information extended more posteriorly and surrounded HG slightly more than the region covarying with spectral information on the left. On the right, the temporally covarying region extended more anterolaterally along the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and posterolaterally onto the middle temporal gyrus than the spectral covariations. The spectral analysis revealed larger regions of significance than the temporal analysis bilaterally, with a larger region of significance on the right than on the left (16,767 mm3 on right vs 16,119 mm3 on left) (Fig. 3, Table 2). The spectral region of covariation extended substantially more anteriorly and posteriorly along the STG, and covered more planum temporale bilaterally than the temporal region of covariation.Cortical regions with BOLD activity significantly covarying with temporal () and spectral () information. Results from individual subjects are overlaid on their own structural scans. Transverse slices tilted at a 35\u00b0 angle allow visualization of results along the superior temporal plane. Data are ordered by asymmetry index descending in a clockwise direction; the subject with the highest leftward HG asymmetry is shown in the top left corner. Therefore, the top row shows the leftward asymmetric group, and the bottom row shows the non-leftward asymmetric group. Group average covariation maps are shown to the right of individual data. Color bars indicate significance (). , , Activation values from HG ROIs are plotted in arbitrary units for temporal () and spectral () conditions. Error bars indicate SE (, ). L, Left; R, right.Significance peaks and values: , ,  coordinates in MNI space, peak  and  values, false discovery rate-corrected  values, and extent of hemispheric cluster size in cubic millimetersWe overlaid our covariation significance maps with Morosan's probability maps of three HG subdivisions thresholded at 50% probability. These subdivisions divide HG into three cytoarchitectonically distinct regions in the posteromedial to anterolateral direction. The center region, Te1.0, is thought to correspond with the auditory koniocortical core field, with Te1.1 positioned posteromedially, and Te1.2 anterolaterally. In the temporal covariation analysis, significant regions on the left included most of Te1.0 and all of Te1.1. It did not extend to Te1.2 on the left. On the right, significant regions included portions of all three regions. In the spectral covariation analysis, significant regions on the left included all of areas Te1.0 and Te1.1, and a slight amount of Te1.2. On the right, significant regions included all of Te1.0, most of Te1.1, and a portion of Te1.2. Activity in core auditory regions is not always found to covary with acoustic parameters, but this result was seen in the Sch\u00f6nwiesner et al. (2005) study using similar stimuli.Activation strength in response to each temporal condition was extracted from individual HG ROIs (Fig. 3). A 2 \u00d7 4 ANOVA of side (left vs right) by rate (Base, Rate1, Rate2, Rate3) was performed. A main effect of rate was found ( = 5.4, df = 3, 27,  = 0.005), with no main effect of side ( = 0.20, df = 1, 9,  > 0.6). A significant rate-by-side interaction was found ( = 4.5, df = 3, 27,  = 0.01). Planned comparison one-way paired  tests between left and right activity within each temporal condition helped inform the interaction result. Significant differences between sides were found for the base condition, with right more active than left ( = 2.38, df = 9,  < 0.05), and the Rate3 condition, with left more active than right ( = 1.9, df = 9,  < 0.05). Left and right responses did not differ in Rate1 and Rate2 conditions ( > 0.05 both comparisons).  Wilcoxon signed-rank tests compared activity levels between conditions within sides. Setting the \u03b1 at 0.01 to account for multiple comparisons, activity on the left was significantly greater in the Rate3 condition than either Base or Rate1 ( = 2.6,  < 0.01 both comparisons). No differences between conditions were detected on the right ( > 0.01 all comparisons).Activation strength in response to each spectral condition was also extracted from individually marked HG ROIs and submitted to a 2 \u00d7 3 ANOVA of side (left vs right) by spectral condition (Base, Spect1, Spect2) (Fig. 3). A main effect of condition was found ( = 12.9, df = 2, 18,  < 0.0005), with no main effect of side ( = 2.4, df = 1, 9,  > 0.1). No interaction was found ( = 1.4, df = 2, 18,  > 0.2). To investigate the main effect of condition,  Wilcoxon signed-rank tests compared activity between conditions collapsed across sides. The Base condition had significantly lower activity levels than either Spect1 ( = 2.8,  = 0.005) or Spect2 ( = 2.7,  = 0.007). Planned comparison one-way paired  tests between left and right activity were also performed. Aside from the right/left difference reported above for the Base condition, neither spectral condition significantly differed ( > 0.05 both comparisons).The chief goal of this study was to relate structural HG measurements to degree of lateralization of HG activity in response to acoustically manipulated sounds. We wanted to test the prediction that normal variations in HG volumes would be related to normal variations in acoustic processing. Our analyses support this claim.Subjects were divided into groups based on their pattern of anatomical HG asymmetry. The leftward asymmetric group (LHG > RHG) included five subjects with larger left HG than right HG, and the non-leftward asymmetric group (LHG \u2264 RHG) included five subjects with either symmetric or rightward asymmetric HG.Two ROI pairs in left and right auditory cortex were constructed, based on the regions showing significant covariation with the temporal and spectral manipulations described above (Fig. 3,). To control for differences in left and right HG volumes, we made each ROI pair symmetric by adding its right/left mirror image to itself, thus equating the size of search areas in the right and left hemispheres. Hence, the symmetric ROIs are maximally sensitive to all voxels that show a response to the stimulus, but are unbiased with respect to the question of interest, right versus left degree of response. This method also avoids unnecessarily penalizing those with atypical HG patterns, e.g., right larger than left HG. The extent of activity significantly covarying with stimulus change within right and left ROIs was compared using two 2 \u00d7 2 group-by-side ANOVAs. These were followed by planned within-group Wilcoxon signed-rank tests comparing extent of acoustically covarying activity within the left versus right ROIs. In addition, the correlation between HG volume in each hemisphere and the number of voxels that covaried with the acoustic manipulation was assessed.A main effect of side was seen ( = 18.2, df = 1, 8,  < 0.005). No main effect of group or side-by-group interaction was found. Because of the small number of subjects in each group, we also performed planned Wilcoxon signed-rank tests within each group examining the extent of rate-related activity within the left versus right ROI. This analysis revealed a significantly larger cortical extent of rate-related activity in the left ROI of the LHG > RHG group (Wilcoxon  = 2.02,  < 0.05), but not the LHG \u2264 RHG group (Wilcoxon  = 1.48,  > 0.1) (Fig. 4). To further understand the relationship between left and right HG volume and the extent of rate-related activity within right and left HG, we combined the data from both groups and performed Spearman's correlational analyses relating total HG volume to extent of rate-related activity within the ROI on each side. This analysis revealed a continuous structure\u2013function relationship between left HG volume and the extent of cortex showing rate-related activity within the left ROI (Fig. 4) ( = 0.65,  < 0.05). A similar effect was not seen on the right (Fig. 4) ( = 0.03,  > 0.9), suggesting a vital role of cortical rate processing in this structure\u2013function relationship, as opposed to the idea that a larger amount of cortex will simply activate more voxels. Mean effect size of the cortical region significantly covarying with rate within the left and right ROIs was also extracted for each subject and subjected to the same 2 \u00d7 2 group-by-side ANOVA as the extent data. No significant effects were found.Structure\u2013function relationship. , Temporal. , Extent of rate-related cortex in subjects with (LHG > RHG) and without (LHG \u2264 RHG) larger left HG than right HG.

Within-group Wilcoxon signed-rank tests comparing extents in left and right ROIs informed this interaction effect. In the LHG > RHG group, a trend toward larger extents in the right ROI was found ( = 1.75,  = 0.08) (Fig. 4). No right/left difference was seen in the LHG \u2264 RHG group ( = 0.81,  > 0.4). As in the temporal analysis, strength of covariation between HG volume and extent of spectrally related cortex within the corresponding ROI was assessed using Spearman correlations. An opposite pattern to that seen in the temporal analysis was found. Left HG volumes did not significantly correlate with the extent of spectrally related cortex in the left ROI ( = 0.16,  > 0.6) (Fig. 4). In contrast, right HG volumes significantly correlated with extent of spectrally related cortex in the right ROI ( = 0.66,  < 0.05) (Fig. 4). Mean effect size of the cortical region significantly covarying with spectral complexity within the left and right ROIs was also extracted for each subject and subjected to the same 2 \u00d7 2 group-by-side ANOVA as the extent data. No significant effects were found.This study investigated how normal variations in cortical anatomy are reflected in cortical function. We predicted that the relationship between auditory cortical structure and function would differ between temporal and spectral acoustic parameters in a manner consistent with the spectrotemporal model of acoustic processing. These data provide a direct link between normal variations in auditory cortical anatomy and variations in auditory processing of spectral and temporal cues. Specifically, statistical mapping of BOLD activity analyzed with covariation and ROI techniques indicated leftward lateralization for processing of rapidly changing stimuli, and rightward lateralization for processing of spectrally complex stimuli. These data are consistent with the spectrotemporal model of lateralization (Zatorre et al., 2002) and corroborate previous studies (Schwartz and Tallal, 1980; Robin et al., 1990; Belin et al., 1998; Zatorre and Belin, 2001; Sch\u00f6nwiesner et al., 2005; Jamison et al., 2006). These data also support the theory of asymmetric sampling in time, which posits that left auditory cortex integrates over relatively short periods of time, and the right integrates over relatively long periods (Poeppel, 2003). Accordingly, our data showed lateralization of the slowest rate (3 Hz) to the right and the fastest rate (33 Hz) to the left. Anatomical variability of HG measured here is also consistent with other reports (Penhune et al., 1996, 2003; Leonard et al., 1998; Morosan et al., 2001; Wong et al., 2008). However, the present data are the first explicitly linking anatomical variability to individual differences in both temporal and spectral acoustic processing.People with the typical pattern of leftward HG asymmetry showed opposite patterns of functional activity in response to temporal versus spectral acoustic changes. Consistent with the spectrotemporal trade-off model of acoustic processing, they had larger extents of rate-related cortex in LHG and tended toward larger extents of spectral-related cortex in RHG. We also saw larger LHG associate with temporal processing and larger RHG associate with spectral processing when looking at absolute HG volumes, regardless of typical or atypical HG asymmetry. The specificity of the temporal and spectral structure\u2013function relationships to single and opposite HG supports the notion that the relationships are founded on the response to acoustic manipulations, and are not simply attributable to larger cortical regions necessarily producing more activity. Indeed, HG volume did not predict response strength. This indicates that a bigger left HG may recruit a larger cortical region for rate-related processing, but the active region will not show increased activity levels over those with a smaller gyrus. The finding that functional responses from those with the typical HG asymmetry pattern was consistent with much of the functional spectrotemporal literature makes sense in that subject samples from those studies likely include more people with larger left HG than with larger right HG.The idea that more cortical area is required for increased resolution or specialization may be a central property of the sensorimotor system. Penfield's classic studies revealed that larger sensorimotor cortex regions are devoted to the hand than to other similarly sized body parts, such as the knee, to support the increased hand sensitivity and control finer movements necessary for hand use (Penfield and Boldrey, 1937). Additionally, more cortex in the primary visual area is devoted to the fovea, the retinal region responsible for our high-resolution central vision, than the surrounding area, which processes peripheral vision at a lower resolution (Holmes, 1918). Therefore, the larger cortical auditory region recruited in some of the subjects in the present study may reflect an increased sensitivity to rapid auditory input in those subjects. This increased cortical representation might be associated with a larger number of neurons or more fibers.White matter volume did not selectively relate to lateralization of auditory temporal or spectral processing. However, consistent with previous work, volumetric asymmetries were larger in white than in gray matter, lending support to the importance of white matter structural characteristics in processing temporal acoustic features (Penhune et al., 1996). Although we suspect that microstructural white matter differences between left and right HG may be driving the lateralization of rapid auditory processing, volumetric asymmetry of white matter may be too gross a measure to see this effect. In our sample, white, gray, and total volume asymmetries were highly correlated. Uncovering the distinct influence of white matter on auditory lateralization may require direct assessment of its microstructure with techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging.The results described in this paper were found with a small number of subjects, necessarily reducing statistical power. However, our anatomical and functional analyses were consistent with previous reports. Additionally, the structure\u2013function relationships found were specific both to side of HG and acoustical property, and were consistent with predictions based on the spectrotemporal model of acoustic processing. The coherent patterns in our results therefore give us confidence in their validity.Left HG structure has recently been implicated in language learning. Wong et al. (2008) found that subjects who successfully learned to associate foreign (Mandarin-like) pitch patterns with word meaning had larger left HG volume than those who had difficulty learning these associations. Although spectral changes determined the semantic pitch patterns, the learning task required subjects to attend moment-to-moment pitch changes, a temporally demanding task. Additionally, Golestani et al. (2002, 2007) showed that people who quickly learned to discriminate foreign speech sounds (Hindi-like retroflex consonants differing in 40 ms formant transitions) had greater concentration of white matter in left HG and parietal areas than those who learned more slowly. The present results suggest that a larger left HG, associated with a larger extent of rate-responsive cortex, could be associated with more efficient processing of speech-related cues, which could facilitate learning and perceiving new speech sounds. We might therefore predict that subjects in this study with leftward asymmetric HGs would be better at learning these linguistic tasks. In contrast to our findings, a previous study found no clear relationship between HG volume and language lateralization, as measured with the intracarotid sodium amytal test (Dorsaint-Pierre et al., 2006), but did find that gray matter density in Broca's area predicted lateralization. This finding likely relates to the speech production task used to elicit lateralization in that study, whereas the present study used a purely perceptual paradigm. It is also possible that HG volume may only relate to speech perception when learning new speech sounds, a time when acoustic fidelity impacts perception more strongly than once linguistic proficiency has been reached (Takata and Nabelek, 1990; Garcia Lecumberri and Cooke, 2006).Two comprehensive studies link volumetric HG measures to tonal processing and musicianship (Schneider et al., 2002, 2005). In the 2002 study, musicians showed larger HG gray matter than nonmusicians across hemispheres. Additionally, subjects with more HG gray matter had higher musical aptitude scores and larger early cortical responses to tonal stimuli. In the 2005 study, relative left and right volumes of lateral HG gray matter determined how subjects perceived ambiguous tones. Those relying on spectral cues showed a rightward asymmetry, and those relying on fundamental frequency showed a leftward asymmetry. Interestingly, lateralization of early cortical responses to these same tones mimicked the anatomical asymmetries. Together, these studies relate the absolute size of HG gray matter volume to musical aptitude, and its relative size to perceptual strategy. The present study specifically relates absolute size of right HG to the extent of right auditory cortex sensitive to increasing spectral information. The extent of this spectral-related cortex could affect the strength of early cortical responses measured by Schneider et al. (2002, 2005). Although the manner of volumetric measurement differs substantially between these studies, it appears clear that anatomical variations in HG affect the way spectral information is processed both at a basic acoustic processing level and in forming a perceptual strategy.A number of microanatomical differences between left and right HG provide some insight into potential mechanisms by which auditory cortical structure may affect the way it processes acoustic information. Fast temporal processing requires a maximally efficient organization coupled with optimized transfer times, whereas processing fine spectral differences requires a denser, more interconnected neural network. Primary auditory cortex is organized in columns of neuronal clusters, with cells within a neuronal column sharing functional properties. Neuronal columns in left HG are wider in diameter and spaced further apart (Seldon, 1981). Additionally, intercolumn connections are less tangled and more highly myelinated on the left, allowing faster, more efficiently routed transmission of information (Seldon, 1982; Anderson et al., 1999; Sigalovsky et al., 2006). Columns in right HG are closer together and more interconnected, possibly allowing finer spectral distinctions to be coded. Left HG also appears to have a higher density of neurons, with a larger proportion of large pyramidal cells (Hutsler and Gazzaniga, 1996; Morand et al., 2001). Differences between the way cells in left and right auditory cortex connect to other cells have also been found. Larger pyramidal cells have longer axons, giving the left HG more neurons with a longer reach (Hutsler and Gazzaniga, 1996). Within auditory association cortex on the left posterior superior temporal gyrus, neuronal columns are spaced further apart with longer interconnecting axons than those in the same region on the right or HG on either side (Galuske et al., 2000). Additionally, more minicolumns in left HG are associated with more fibers in the posterior midbody of the corpus callosum, where primary auditory cortex is known to project interhemispherically (Chance et al., 2006). All of these features likely contribute in yet poorly understood ways to the functional differences between left and right auditory cortices observed here and in previous studies.This study describes a relationship between HG volumetric asymmetry and acoustic processing. The literature concerning cortical structure\u2013function relationships at this level of detail is still sparse. Our data address how normal variations in the structure of sensory cortices may affect the way people process and perceive sensory information.This work was supported by the following agencies: The National Institutes of Health\u2013National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, The American Hearing Research Foundation, The National Organization for Hearing Research Foundation, The Hugh Knowles Foundation, and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.

In the present study, we have addressed the role of agonist binding and desensitization in the early trafficking of glutamate receptor-D (GluR-D) AMPA receptors. Analysis of point-mutated GluR-D receptors, via electrophysiology and immunofluorescence, revealed that agonist-binding activity is essential for efficient delivery to cell surface in transfected cell lines and in neurons. Cotransfection with stargazin could fully rescue the surface expression of nonbinding mutant receptors in cell lines, indicating that stargazin is able to interact with and promote exit of AMPA receptors from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) independently of agonist binding. Secretion of separately expressed ligand-binding domain constructs showed a similar dependency of agonist binding to that observed with full-length GluR-D, supporting the idea that glutamate-induced closure of the binding site cleft is registered by ER quality control as a necessary priming step for transport competence. In contrast to agonist binding, the ability of the receptor to undergo desensitization had only a minor influence on trafficking. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that AMPA receptors are synthesized as intrinsically unstable molecules, which require glutamate binding for structural stability and for transport-competence.Maturation of newly synthesized ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluR) in the rough endoplasmic reticulum is subject to exquisite quality control mechanisms to ensure that only properly folded and assembled receptors are capable of leaving the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in an efficient manner (Vandenberghe and Bredt, 2004). Consistent with findings on well characterized model proteins, exit of iGluR from ER is likely to require a stably folded oligomeric structure and may further depend on blocking or shielding of specific sequence motifs which hinder export from ER (for review, see Ellgaard and Helenius, 2003; Sitia and Braakman, 2003). Arginine-based ER retention signals (Michelsen et al., 2005) have been identified in the NMDA receptor subunit NR1 (Standley et al., 2000; Scott et al., 2001; Xia et al., 2001), in the kainate receptor subunits KA2 (Ren et al., 2003a; Nasu-Nishimura et al., 2006), and GluR5 splice variant 2b (Ren et al., 2003b). For AMPA receptors, which form both GluR-B (GluR2) subunit-containing heteromeric receptors and GluR-B-lacking homomeric and heteromeric receptors, no such canonical ER retention/retrieval motifs have been identified. However, an arginine residue uniquely present in the channel pore region of the edited GluR-B subunit has been reported to regulate ER exit by preventing the transport of homomeric GluR-B receptors (Greger et al., 2002, 2003). Another mechanism, based on an extracellularly located splice form-specific valine/leucine residue, inhibits the ER exit of homomeric flop-type GluR-A and GluR-D AMPA receptors (Coleman et al., 2006).Point mutations in the agonist-binding domain of  GLR-1 (Grunwald and Kaplan, 2003), mammalian kainate (Mah et al., 2005; Valluru et al., 2005; Fleck, 2006; Priel et al., 2006), and AMPA receptor subunits (Greger et al., 2006) have been reported to impede the expression of the cognate receptors on cell surface. The nature of the responsible mechanism(s) and the importance of agonist-binding activity itself, for the transport of AMPA receptors, are still poorly understood. Further, AMPA receptors are unique in their association with stargazin family regulatory proteins [transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs)] (Chen et al., 2000; Tomita et al., 2003). We investigated the early trafficking of GluR-D AMPA receptors carrying mutations in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) to eliminate agonist binding or desensitization. Our results indicate that agonist-binding activity is essential for the transport of GluR-D to plasma membrane both in cell lines and in neurons, whereas the ability to desensitize may play a less critical role. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coexpression with stargazin is able to overcome the transport block of the nonbinding AMPA receptor mutants in cell lines. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that both glutamate and stargazin make additive incremental contributions to structural stability of AMPA receptor ligand-binding domain and thereby promote the exit of the receptor from the endoplasmic reticulum.Plasmids for the expression of wild-type and mutated full-length AMPA receptor subunits in mammalian cells were constructed in pcDNA3.1 (Stratagene). GluR-D flip (GluR-Di) and flop (GluR-Do) expression plasmids have been described previously (Pasternack et al., 2002; Coleman et al., 2006). GluR-Di point mutations R507K, E727D, and E727Q were made by replacing the wild-type restriction fragment with the corresponding fragment in the respective mutant construct made originally in the insect cell vector pFastbac1 (Jouppila et al., 2002). The L505Y mutation was introduced in pFastbac1 by overlap extension PCR with mutagenic primers. All GluR-Di constructs, except for L505Y (untagged), contained a Flag epitope inserted between the signal peptide and the first residue of the predicted mature polypeptide (alanine-22). Wild-type and mutated GluR-D S1S2 fusion protein cDNAs (Lampinen et al., 1998, 2002) were transferred from pFastbac1 as I-dIII fragments into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech), replacing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) sequence as described previously (Coleman et al., 2006).Primary antibodies used in immunofluorescence staining were monoclonal M1 anti-Flag (Sigma; 5 \u03bcg/ml), and Fab7 and Fab22 (both at 10 \u03bcg/ml) (Jespersen et al., 2000). Secondary antibody used was Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse (7 \u03bcg/ml) from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. For immunoblotting, anti-GluR-BDLONG (Coleman et al., 2006) or anti-stargazin (1:5000) made in-house were used. Commercial antibodies used were rabbit anti-myc (AbCam; 0.1 \u03bcg/ml) and rabbit anti-NMDAR1 (Chemicon; 0.2 \u03bcg/ml); secondary antibody used was anti-rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences; 1:5000).HEK293 and COS-7 cells were cultured and transfected as described previously (Coleman et al., 2003). For coexpression, cDNAs were transfected at a 1:1 ratio. For drug treatments, 50 \u03bcm 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[]quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX) (Tocris) in DMSO or 100 \u03bcm 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5-2,3-benzodiazepine hydrochloride (GYKI-52466) (Tocris) in ethanol was added immediately after transfection; control cells received vehicle only. The cells were analyzed as described below. For patch clamp experiments, the cells were cotransfected with pEGFP-C1 for visualization of GFP fluorescence. Primary cortical neurons were isolated from embryonic day 18 mouse embryos and transfected after 10 d  (d.i.v.) and analyzed at 14 d.i.v. as previously described (Cai et al., 2006).Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made from GFP-positive HEK293 cells with Axopatch 200B amplifier and Clampex 8.2 software (Molecular Devices) (M\u00f6ykkynen et al., 2003). Electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments) and had a resistance of 4\u20136 M\u03a9 when filled with internal solution containing (in mm): -methyl-d-glucamine 100; CH3SO3H 100; CsF 40; MgCl2 10; HEPES 10; EGTA 5, pH 7.4. The cells were continuously perfused with recording solution containing (in mm): NaCl 150; KCl 2.5; CaCl2 2.5; MgCl2 1; HEPES 10; glucose 10, pH 7.4. Glutamate was dissolved in the recording solution and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.4. Glutamate was applied to the cells using a stepper motor driven applicator (Warner Instrument). The recordings were digitized using a Digidata 1322A analog to digital converter (Molecular Devices) with a sampling rate of 10 kHz and filtering using a lowpass bassel filter at 1 kHz. Each glutamate application was done twice and traces were averaged. Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad) was used for the statistical analysis.Transfected COS-7 cells were fixed and immunostained 40 h after transfection, as previously described (Coleman et al., 2006). Neuronal staining was done as described (Cai et al., 2006). Images were obtained and analyzed as previously described (Cai et al., 2006; Coleman et al., 2006) with an Olympus Provis AX70 epifluorescence microscope coupled to a Photometrics SenSys air-cooled CCD camera and Image ProPlus software.Transfected HEK293 cells were biotinylated with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) as described previously (Coleman et al., 2006). Triton X-100 extracts were bound to streptavidin-conjugated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and precipitated proteins were harvested and analyzed as described earlier (Coleman et al., 2003). For analysis of GluR-D S1S2 construct secretion, growth media were collected from transfected HEK293 cells 40 h after transfection, and 1 mm PMSF was added. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation (1500 \u00d7 , 5 min, 4\u00b0C). Samples of media and total cell extracts prepared in Triton X-100 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (Coleman et al., 2003). Immunoblots were scanned via Adobe Photoshop and analyzed using Image ProPlus software as described (Coleman et al., 2006).Triton X-100 extracts from transfected cells were incubated with Endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs) according to manufacturer's instructions and as previously described (Coleman et al., 2006).Statistical analyses of the electrophysiological and ligand-binding data were performed by using GraphPad Prism 4.02 (GraphPad Software). Numerical data are expressed as arithmetic mean \u00b1 SEM, or as the mean with its 95% confidence interval in parentheses, as indicated.To study the role of agonist binding in cellular transport of AMPA receptors, we engineered mutations in the flip isoform of GluR-D (GluR-Di), which is efficiently expressed on the plasma membrane in transfected COS-7, HeLa, and HEK293 cells, whereas the flop isoform is retained in the ER (Coleman et al., 2006). We focused on two key residues directly involved in agonist binding, arginine-507 (R507) and glutamate-727 (E727) (Fig. 1). R507 is homologous to GluR-B (GluR2) R506, which interacts with the \u03b1-carboxylate of glutamate and other agonists, whereas E727 (corresponding to GluR-B E726) has hydrogen bond and coulombic interaction with the \u03b1-amino group of the agonist (Fig. 1\n). Previous studies have demonstrated that even the relatively conservative R507K and E727Q mutations lead to a complete or near-complete loss of agonist-binding activity as determined by radioligand ([3H]AMPA) binding assay or by fluorescence titration, whereas E727D mutation preserves binding, although with somewhat lowered affinity for glutamate (Lampinen et al., 1998; Abele et al., 2000; Jouppila et al., 2002). To analyze the role of desensitization, we used a leucine-to-tyrosine mutation (L505Y), which in other AMPA receptor subunits leads to loss of desensitization (Stern-Bach et al., 1998; Robert et al., 2001; Sun et al., 2002). This residue does not make any direct contacts with the agonist. Rather, it contributes to a subunit interface which is presumably characteristic of the short-lived active (non-desensitized) conformation and is stabilized by the tyrosine mutation (Sun et al., 2002). Consistent with this structural information, the L505Y mutation, introduced either in the full-length GluR-D or in the S1S2 ligand-binding domain construct, did not significantly affect the agonist-binding properties in radioligand binding assay (supplemental Table 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).Location of the mutated residues. \n\n, Sequence alignment indicating the positions of the residues corresponding to GluR-D L505Y (yellow), R507 (blue), T677 (green), and E727 (red) in AMPA receptor subunit GluR-B, kainate receptor subunits GluR6 and KA-2, NMDA receptor subunit NR2A, and  GLR-1. Sequence numbering starts from first methionine, thus including the signal peptide. \n\n, Model of GluR-B S1S2 in complex with glutamate (1FTJ) (Armstrong and Gouaux, 2000) showing the residues equivalent to GluR-D residues L505, R507, T677, and E727. Color codes are as before. Bound glutamate is shown as van der Waals spheres. The figure was prepared by using iMol (courtesy of P. Rotkiewicz, Burnham Institute for Medical Research, La Jolla, CA).To verify the functional status of the mutant receptors, whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made from transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 2). l-Glutamate (10 mm) elicited rapidly desensitizing currents in both wild-type (wt) and E727D receptor channels (Fig. 2\n), whereas no responses could be recorded for R507K and E727Q mutants in agreement with their inactivity in agonist binding (Jouppila et al., 2002). Glutamate responses showed similar rates of desensitization for wild-type and E727D channels; time constant for dissociation, \u03c4des, was 5.1 \u00b1 0.30 ms ( = 16) for wt GluR-Di and 5.8 \u00b1 0.36 ms ( = 9) for E727D. A substantial non-desensitizing steady state current was observed with the E727D mutant but not with wt GluR-D (Fig. 2\n). Glutamate triggered a robust non-desensitizing current in GluR-D L505Y channels (Fig. 2\n), in agreement with earlier findings in other AMPA receptor subunits (Stern-Bach et al., 1998; Robert et al., 2001, Sun et al., 2002; Mitchell and Fleck, 2007). Responses to AMPA (100 \u03bcm) were qualitatively similar to those obtained with glutamate, except that L505Y channels showed an initial desensitizing component in addition to the sustained non-desensitizing current (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Dose\u2013response analysis revealed that L505Y and E727D mutations exert strong but opposite effects on glutamate potency: the former produced a 40-fold increase, whereas the E727D channels showed a 32-fold decrease in potency (Fig. 2\n). The corresponding EC50 values were 49 (47\u201352) \u03bcm, 2.0 (1.6\u20132.5) mm, and 64 (41\u201398) mm for L505Y, wild-type, and E727D GluR-Di channels, respectively. The leftward shift in the glutamate dose\u2013response curve of L505Y is consistent with reported effects of analogous mutations in other subunits (Stern-Bach et al., 1998; Robert et al., 2001; Mitchell and Fleck, 2007). In contrast to glutamate, AMPA potencies were not strongly affected by the mutations: EC50 values were 86 (81\u201391) \u03bcm for wt GluR-Di, 100 (95\u2013105) \u03bcm for E727D, and 30 (24\u201338) \u03bcm for L505Y mutant (Fig. 2\n).Electrophysiological characterization of point-mutated GluR-D channels expressed in HEK293 cells. \n\n, Representative current responses to l-glutamate (10 mm; horizontal bar) for wild-type GluR-Di and mutant channels. Note the different scales for wild type versus mutants. E727Q and R507K mutant channels showed no response to 10 mm glutamate application. \n\n, Dose\u2013response curves for l-glutamate and AMPA obtained for wt GluR-Di and for the E727D and L505Y mutants.We analyzed the cellular localization of GluR-Di mutants in transfected COS-7 cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. Comparison of anti-Flag immunostaining in permeabilized and nonpermeabilized cells indicated that while all constructs had closely similar overall expression levels, the nonbinding R507K and E727Q mutant receptors were largely absent from cell surface, whereas wt GluR-Di and the E727D mutant showed intense surface staining (Fig. 3\n). Because the Flag epitope was not present in the GluR-Di L505Y construct, we used the monoclonal antibody Fab7 (Jespersen et al., 2000) for staining. This antibody is specific for a common N-terminal epitope in GluR-B and -D subunits. L505Y receptors were expressed in COS-7 cells as indicated by robust staining in permeabilized cells, but in contrast to bright Fab7 surface labeling of wt GluR-Di, only minimal L505Y staining was detected on the plasma membrane (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) (Fig. 3\n). We noticed that cultures transfected for expression of L505Y channels frequently contained floating/dead cells, prompting us to consider the possibility that moderate expression of the non-desensitizing GluR-Di L505Y channels may be toxic for the cells. The previously described electrophysiology results could result from low levels of channel expression, as detected by a more sensitive technique. Therefore, a similar immunostaining was performed for cells transfected and maintained in the continuous presence of NBQX, a competitive antagonist. Consistent with the predicted toxicity of L505Y expression, inclusion of NBQX (50 \u03bcm) in the culture medium led to a dramatic increase in the surface expression of L505Y, albeit not to wt GluR-Di levels (Fig. 3\n). In contrast, NBQX did not improve plasma membrane expression of the nonbinding R507K or E727Q mutants, nor did it have any effect on wt GluR-Di or GluR-Do, or E727D (Fig. 3\n) (supplemental Figs. 3, 4, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Furthermore, GYKI-52466 (100 \u03bcm), a noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonist, increased the surface expression of L505Y but not of the R507K mutant, similarly to what was observed with NBQX (supplemental Fig. 4, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).Immunofluoresence staining of point-mutated GluR-D receptors expressed in transfected COS-7 cells. The labeling was performed under nonpermeabilized conditions to reveal the surface staining, whereas the permeabilized staining indicates the total expression. Anti-Flag was used for all constructs except for L505Y, which lacks the Flag epitope, and was stained with monoclonal antibody Fab7 [see supplemental Fig. 2 (available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) for additional controls]. \n\n, No surface expression is observed in cells expressing nonbinding GluR-Di mutants R507K and E727Q or for the non-desensitizing mutant L505Y. \n\n, \n\n, Inclusion of NBQX, a high-affinity competitive antagonist, has no effect on GluR-Di R507K (\n\n) but rescues the surface expression of GluR-Di L505Y (\n\n). Graphs show quantification of antibody surface labeling of cells expressing indicated constructs in the presence and absence of NBQX from the time of transfection.To quantify the relative levels of cell surface expression of mutated GluR-D receptors, we used membrane impermeant biotinylation of transfected HEK293 cells (in the absence of NBQX). GluR-Di and the point-mutated receptors were expressed at similar levels as indicated by immunoblots probed with anti-BDLONG, which recognizes the cytoplasmic C terminus of GluR-D (Coleman et al., 2006) (Fig. 4\n,). In good agreement with fluorescence microscopy, only wt GluR-Di and the E727D mutant were labeled with biotin (Fig. 4\n,). Plasma membrane levels of the GluR-Di mutants R507K, L505Y, and E727Q were low and in the same range as those of the wild-type flop isoform, retained in the ER in transfected cell lines (Fig. 4\n,) (Coleman et al., 2006). Next, we determined the sensitivity of GluR-Di mutants to endoglycosidase H (EndoH) to identify the step in the secretory pathway affected by ligand-binding domain mutations. Of the four mutant receptors, only E727D showed resistance to EndoH as indicated by the separation of the broad receptor band into a doublet in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4\n). The extent of EndoH-resistance of GluR-Di E727D (\u223c50%) was similar to that previously observed for wt GluR-Di (Coleman et al., 2006). In contrast, E727Q, R507K, and L505Y mutants were fully sensitive to EndoH treatment suggesting that the receptor mutants unable to reach the cell surface are primarily retained in the ER.Consistent differences in cellular localization of mutated GluR-D receptors in HEK293 cells. \n\n, Immunoblot of biotinylated surface-expressed receptors in transfected HEK293 cells.

Extracts of transfected HEK293 cells were immunoprecipitated with Fab7 antibody, treated with endoglycosidase H as indicated to cleave immature high-mannose glycans, and analyzed by anti-BDLONG immunoblotting.To find out whether the transport effects exerted by LBD mutations were entirely dependent on the native-like tetrameric structure or whether they could also manifest independently, by the LBD itself, we analyzed the secretion of S1S2 LBD constructs. In addition to the mutations tested in the full-length receptor, we included two further mutants, E727A and T677A; neither had activity in [3H]AMPA binding assay (Lampinen et al., 1998, 2002). In GluR-B, the equivalent threonine residue to T677 forms essential interactions with the \u03b3-carboxylate of glutamate (Armstrong and Gouaux, 2000). Immunoblot analysis of media and cell extracts of transfected HEK293 cells revealed that wt GluR-Di S1S2 and the E727D mutant were efficiently secreted into the culture medium, and the L505Y mutant showed an intermediate level of secretion, whereas all nonbinding mutant proteins were retained in the cells (Fig. 5\n,). These findings correlate well with those obtained with the full-length receptor constructs, including the contrasting behaviors of the flip and flop isoforms (Fig. 5) (Coleman et al., 2006), and strongly suggest that binding of an endogenous agonist (glutamate) to the LBD is obligatory for trafficking of GluR-Di forward from the ER. In addition, the results indicate that the integrity of the LBD can be monitored by cellular quality control independently of the assembled multimeric structure.Secretion of GluR-D S1S2 ligand-binding domain constructs from transfected HEK293 cells. \n\n, Anti-Myc immunoblots of HEK293 growth media (\n\n) and Triton X-100 extracts (\n\n) of cells collected 40 h after transfection. \n\n, Quantification of the immunoblots. Ratios of secreted and cell-associated immunoreactivities are shown in relation to wt GluR-Di S1S2, given an arbitrary value of 100%. The values and error bars correspond to a minimum of three independent experiments.In neurons and in cell lines, transport of AMPA receptors from ER to cell surface is strongly promoted by stargazin and other TARPs (Chen et al., 2000; Vandenberghe et al., 2005a). Stargazin increases the surface expression of a non-desensitizing GluR-A mutant (L497Y) in oocytes but does not effect the surface expression level of the constitutively active Lurcher-like mutant (Tomita et al., 2007), indicating that the underlying molecular interactions are dependent on specific receptor conformations. Because the effects of binding site mutations have not previously been analyzed, it was of interest to examine whether the trafficking of GluR-Di mutants would be influenced by the presence of stargazin. Unexpectedly, all GluR-Di mutant receptors, including the nonbinding R507K and E727Q receptors, became readily detectable by cell surface biotinylation when coexpressed with stargazin (Fig. 6\n, top panel). Densitometric analysis of the blots indicated similar overall expression levels and steady-state surface levels for all constructs (Fig. 6\n,), although the surface expression of L505Y and E727D mutants showed more variation than others, and, respectively, appeared somewhat lower and higher than the wild-type level (Fig. 6\n). The differences had no statistical significance, however. These results demonstrate that stargazin is able to interact with and promote the trafficking of AMPA receptor mutants incapable of agonist binding.Coexpression with stargazin rescues the surface expression of GluR-Di mutants in HEK293 cells. \n\n, Biotinylation assay indicating levels of surface-expressed and total GluR-Di mutants and total stargazin levels as detected by immunoblotting with anti-BDLONG serum (top and middle) and with anti-stargazin serum (bottom). \n\n, \n\n, Quantification of surface (\n\n) and total (\n\n) GluR-D protein expression in HEK293 cells relative to wt GluR-Di. Error bars indicate mean \u00b1 SD,  = 4. For controls in the absence of stargazin, see Figure 4\n, representative of an experiment performed in parallel and under identical conditions.Interestingly, stargazin changed the electrophoretic banding pattern of the mutant receptors. In the absence of stargazin, both wild-type and mutated receptors migrated as a single major band (Fig. 4\n, bottom panel), whereas in the presence of stargazin, all GluR-D constructs except for wt GluR-Di resolved as clear doublets (Fig. 6\n, middle panel). This is suggestive of a less stringent coupling between glycan processing and passage through the secretory pathway for GluR-Di in the presence of stargazin. To ascertain whether stargazin expression could cause a general relaxation of ER quality control, we examined the transport to cell surface of GluR-Di\u039422\u2013162, a deletion mutant not transported to the cell surface, most probably caused by incomplete folding in the absence of a substantial N-terminal polypeptide fragment (Pasternack et al., 2002). As an additional control, we used the NR1a subunit of the NMDA receptor, which is poorly expressed on the cell surface when expressed without NR2A or 2B subunits (McIlhinney et al.,1998; Okabe et al., 1999). As determined by biotinylation assay, GluR-Di\u039422\u2013162 and NR1a showed a minimal presence on the plasma membrane in transfected HEK293 cells both in the absence and in the presence of stargazin (supplemental Fig. 5,, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Thus, stargazin does not induce a general, nonspecific relaxation in quality control of the secretory pathway. Furthermore, the ineffectiveness of stargazin with GluR-Di\u039422\u2013162, a mutant receptor likely to have a gross folding defect, is consistent with the notion that stargazin interacts only with nearly or completely folded/assembled AMPA receptors (Vandenberghe et al., 2005b).The heterologous expression studies discussed above were performed in cell lines (COS-7, HEK293) that are well characterized model systems suitable for the analysis of general features and mechanisms of protein folding and transport; however, they do not natively express GluR-D or other AMPA receptor subunits. Therefore, it was important to complement the investigation with studies in neuronal cells that do endogenously express GluR-D on cell surface. For this purpose, we used cultured mouse cortical neurons. Immunofluorescence labeling with GluR-D N terminus-specific monoclonal antibody Fab22 (Jespersen et al., 2000) showed a punctate pattern of surface staining which became gradually more pronounced as the cultures approached maturity (supplemental Fig. 6, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).To examine the role of agonist-binding activity in neuronal receptor transport, the cortical neurons were cotransfected with GFP and GluR-D cDNAs at 10 d.i.v. and visualized for GFP expression and anti-Flag surface staining at 14 d.i.v., a time when the endogenous GluR-D is well expressed. Clear and intense surface labeling was seen for recombinant GluR-Di and GluR-Do receptors, demonstrating that the block in the ER exit observed for GluR-Do in cell lines is not present in cortical neurons. In contrast, the nonbinding GluR-Di mutants R507K and E727Q, which also displayed a transport block in cell lines (in the absence of stargazin), did not show any surface expression in transfected neurons (Fig. 7). Because cortical neurons express stargazin and related TARPs (Tomita et al., 2003), the specific trafficking defect observed for the nonbinding GluR-D mutants implies differences in the quality control mechanisms and trafficking checkpoints between neurons and heterologous cells.Expression of GluR-Di, GluR-Do, and GluR-Di mutants R507K and E727Q in mouse cortical neuronal cultures. Transfected neurons were identified by GFP fluorescence. Surface expression was examined by labeling nonpermeabilized cells with anti-Flag.Our findings demonstrate that agonist-binding ability is indispensable for GluR-D AMPA receptor maturation and further suggest that glutamate-induced closure of the binding site cleft is registered by ER quality control as a necessary priming step for transport competence. In discussion of the underlying mechanisms, we will initially focus on agonist binding, as the sole crucial step, followed by consideration of the role of agonist-induced conformational shifts.In its nascent state, the receptor is likely to have a relatively unstable structure with local unfolding favoring retention in the ER through recurrent interactions with luminal and transmembrane chaperones. It is conceivable that binding of endogenous glutamate and subsequent closure of the binding site cleft would provide structural stabilization, which may in itself push the receptor on to the forward pathway. Such a mechanism has been proposed for the effects of \u201cpharmacological chaperones\u201d on G-protein-coupled receptor trafficking (Morello et al., 2000; Pet\u00e4j\u00e4-Repo et al., 2002). Calorimetric and spectroscopic studies actually indicate that glutamate binding confers substantial stability to GluR-D ligand-binding domain: Thermal denaturation point (Tm) of GluR-D S1S2 protein is +35\u221238\u00b0C in the absence and + 49\u00b0C in the presence of a saturating concentration of glutamate (Madden et al., 2000; Pasternack et al., 2003). Although corresponding data for the full-length GluR-D or other AMPA receptor subunits are not available, it is intriguing that these Tm values suggest that under physiological conditions, association with glutamate would confer substantial stability to the otherwise metastable AMPA receptors. Independent support comes from the findings that nonbinding AMPA receptor mutants are fully transport competent when expressed in insect cells, which are cultured at +27\u221228\u00b0C, well below the Tm of S1S2: GluR-D S1S2 mutants R507K and E727Q are efficiently secreted to culture medium (Lampinen et al., 1998), and full-length GluR-A(R481K) mutant, corresponding to R507K, is expressed on the cell surface at wild-type level (Kawamoto et al., 1997).Next, we consider the role of additional glutamate-driven conformational shifts typical of AMPA receptor activity cycle (for review, see Mayer, 2006; Greger et al., 2007). A pore-loop mutation (Q608R) that eliminates homomeric channel activity has no effect on GluR-D surface expression (Coleman et al., 2006), excluding the requirement for ion channel activity in forward trafficking, consistent with observations on other AMPA receptor subunits (Fleck, 2006). However, activity-related conformational transitions, in particular, desensitization, may still be essential for ER exit. The non-desensitizing GluR-B mutant (L504Y) has a poor surface expression in neurons, whereas a mutation (N768D) that accelerates desensitization has the opposite effect (Greger et al., 2006, 2007). Desensitization also seems important in kainate receptor trafficking, as mutant GluR6 receptors locked in a non-desensitizing conformation are poorly transported to cell surface (Priel et al., 2006). Consistent with these studies, we found that the non-desensitizing GluR-Di mutant L505Y does indeed have impaired cell surface expression. However, this was largely corrected by inclusion of an antagonist (NBQX or GYKI-54266) in the cultures. Obviously, the non-desensitizing, Ca2+-conductive mutant channels are toxic; much like heterologously expressed NR1a/NR2A NMDA receptors (Cik et al., 1993). Changes in membrane properties and/or loss of dying cells by shedding in the medium would readily account for the difficulties in visualizing L505Y transfectants in the absence of antagonist. However, some findings do suggest that additional factors, unique to the structural features of the mutant protein, may account for a minor part of the transport defect. First, the antagonist treatments did not completely rescue the surface expression of L505Y, suggestive of a remaining inherent defect. Second, L505Y S1S2 protein was secreted to the culture medium at a lower level than the other agonist-binding constructs (wt, E727D). Possibly, the highly stable dimer interface conferred by the leucine-to-tyrosine mutation, also present in the mutant S1S2 (Sun et al., 2002), interferes with the normal folding and maturation process. Therefore, consistent with what has been suggested for other AMPA and kainate receptors (Priel et al., 2006; Greger et al., 2007), the ability to desensitize may be involved in the maturation/early trafficking of GluR-D as well, but for GluR-D, the role of desensitization is clearly of minor importance relative to agonist binding itself.An implicit assumption of the above-discussed scenarios is that physiological glutamate concentrations in the ER are high enough to cause a significant occupancy of AMPA receptors. Unfortunately, the actual glutamate levels are not known, but glutamate is present in the ER and other compartments of the secretory pathway in amounts detectable by immunochemical staining (Meeker et al., 1989). Based on studies with synthetic model compounds, the ER membrane, unlike most other cellular membranes, is permeable to small molecules (Le Gall et al., 2004). If this applies to glutamate, with cytosolic concentrations in the range of 1\u201310 mm (Ishikawa et al., 2002), AMPA receptors would be well saturated by agonist from early on in their biosynthetic route, even if luminal glutamate concentrations were at somewhat lower levels.The finding that coexpression with stargazin completely rescued the surface expression of nonbinding GluR-Di mutants in cell lines has implications for understanding stargazin-AMPA receptor interaction in the ER. The role of agonist binding in stargazin-AMPA receptor interaction is poorly understood; prolonged exposure to glutamate dissociates the stargazin-AMPA receptor complex (Tomita et al., 2004), although this may depend on the preparation (Vandenberghe et al., 2005b). Studies with chimeric TARPs imply extensive extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic interactions with AMPA receptors (Tomita et al., 2004), but the actual AMPA receptor regions contacted by stargazin have not yet been fully defined. The present findings indicate that stargazin can interact with and promote AMPA receptor trafficking in the absence of bound agonist. This suggests that contacts with the closed binding cleft or with the short-lived subunit interface, typical of the active non-desensitized conformation, have a more minor role than other interaction sites. The latter may include the linker regions between the ligand-binding domain and the transmembrane domains (Milstein and Nicoll, 2008); electron microscopy studies of AMPA receptors purified from native tissue show a transmembrane or juxtamembrane location for the majority of TARP-assigned electron density (Nakagawa et al., 2005).It is enlightening to relate our findings to the potential mechanisms underlying stargazin's chaperone-like activity on AMPA receptors. Stargazin may directly participate in subunit assembly, mask ER retention signals still present in the tetrameric channels and/or improve the structural stability of the receptor. Lack of association of stargazin with monomeric and dimeric subunit species in cerebellar extracts and the lack of excess, nonassembled subunits in stargazer mutant mice argue against a major role in the assembly, and suggest that stargazin associates exclusively with tetrameric receptors (Vandenberghe et al., 2005b). It is difficult to distinguish between the two remaining mechanisms mentioned above, especially as features typical of local unfolding are likely to serve as ER retention signals. For example, the complete rescue by stargazin of the ER transport block of GluR-Do, assigned to amino acid 780 (Coleman et al., 2006), is consistent with both mechanisms, masking a flop-specific retention signal (Leu780) or alternatively, providing additional stability for ER exit. However, the well trafficked GluR-Di isoform lacks any obvious retention signals. Therefore, the dramatic increase in the surface expression of the nonbinding GluR-Di mutants in the presence of stargazin is best explained by an ability to increase the structural stability of the receptor, in an agonist-independent manner. In fact, because of its firm association with AMPA receptors, stargazin has been termed an auxiliary AMPA receptor subunit (Fukata et al., 2005; Vandenberghe et al., 2005b), a situation consistent with a mutually stabilizing relationship between the molecules. Furthermore, the induction of unfolded protein response in cerebellar granule cells of stargazer mice suggests that stargazin suppresses local unfolding of AMPA receptors, in agreement with a role in stabilizing AMPA receptor structure in the ER (Vandenberghe et al., 2005a).In contrast to cell lines cotransfected with stargazin, the inactive binding site mutants R507K and E727Q were not expressed on the surface of transfected cortical neurons, indicating that endogenous TARP expression is not sufficient to overcome the transport block caused by the absence of bound glutamate. This finding emphasizes the crucial role of agonist binding for the transport of AMPA receptors to neuronal plasma membrane. Whether the apparent discrepancy between the neuronal and cell line transfectants is attributable to differences in concentrations of ER folding machinery components, insufficient levels of endogenous TARP, or the existence of additional neuron-specific quality control checkpoints, is unclear.In conclusion, our findings invoke the hypothesis that AMPA receptors are synthesized as intrinsically unstable molecules, which require bound glutamate for structural stability and transport-competence. Thus, glutamate, binding early in the biogenesis, may be regarded either as a small-molecule chaperone or as a structural part of the intracellular AMPA receptor complex, to be disposed of by dissociation as the receptor reaches the cell surface. Additional stability may be provided by stargazin (and other TARPs) as part of the native complex. Considering the close structural similarity and related findings with other iGluR (Grunwald and Kaplan, 2003; Mah et al., 2005; Valluru et al., 2005), the requirement for agonist binding may be a general property of iGluR maturation.This work was supported by Academy of Finland Grant 110900 (to K.K.).

Superoxide produced from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is considered the major source of ROS in neurons during excitation where mitochondrial superoxide levels are normally controlled by superoxide dismutase (SOD-2). The present study hypothesizes that capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia is a consequence of superoxide build-up in spinal dorsal horn neurons and SOD-2 is a major determinant. To test this hypothesis, the spinal levels of SOD-2 activity, inactivated SOD-2 proteins, and mitochondrial superoxide were measured and correlated to the levels of capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia in mice with and without SOD-2 manipulations. The data suggest that superoxide accumulation is a culprit in the abnormal sensory processing in the spinal cord in capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia. Our studies also support the notion that SOD-2 nitration is a critical mechanism that maintains elevated superoxide levels in the spinal cord after capsaicin treatment. Finally, our findings suggest a therapeutic potential for the manipulation of spinal SOD-2 activity in pain conditions.Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are highly reactive oxygen containing molecules that exert a cytotoxic effect in neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, and the normal aging process (Jenner, 1994). Cellular ROS levels are under the tight control of antioxidant systems. The first and most crucial antioxidant is mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (MnSOD; SOD-2), which neutralizes superoxide by converting it into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Hydrogen peroxides are normally further metabolized into molecular oxygen and water by either catalase or glutathione peroxidase (Fridovich, 1995). Superoxide (O2\u25cf\u2212) generated from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is a major source of neuronal ROS (Jenner, 1994; Fridovich, 1995). Superoxide has not received much consideration in persistent pain, but increased ROS production is observed in injured peripheral nerve and inflamed tissue (Khalil et al., 1999; Levy et al., 1999; C\u00edzkov\u00e1 et al., 2002; Twining et al., 2004; Park et al., 2006), and antioxidants produce analgesia in both neuropathic (Tal, 1996; Khalil and Khodr, 2001; Kim et al., 2004) and inflammation (Haley et al., 1992; Wang et al., 1996; Coderre et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2007) pain. However, the underlying mechanism by which ROS reduction alleviates pain is not well understood.The first step of establishing a clear understanding of ROS mechanism in persistent pain is an identification of the major action site: peripheral tissue, the spinal cord, etc. In the capsaicin-induced pain model, an intradermal injection of capsaicin produces two distinctive pain components: primary and secondary hyperalgesia. The primary hyperalgesia is caused by peripheral sensitization and the secondary hyperalgesia is caused by central sensitization (Willis, 2001). Therefore, the capsaicin-induced pain model is an excellent model with which to identify the ROS action site. In our earlier study in the rat, a significant analgesic effect of ROS scavengers was observed in capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia (Lee et al., 2007), suggesting ROS involvement in the spinal cord. Furthermore, ROS accumulation was observed primarily in the mitochondria of dorsal horn neurons after capsaicin treatment in mice (Schwartz et al., 2008). These results suggest that elevated mitochondrial ROS may be an important mechanism of capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia. Thus, we hypothesize that the mitochondrial antioxidant SOD-2 is a critical determinant for mitochondrial superoxide accumulation and subsequent capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia. The importance of SOD-2 has been suggested in a chronic inflammatory pain model (Wang et al., 2004) and a NMDA-induced hyperalgesia (Muscoli et al. 2004). To test this hypothesis, the spinal levels of SOD-2 protein, SOD-2 activity, and inactivated SOD-2 protein were measured in mice after a capsaicin injection to a hind foot with and without ROS scavenger treatments. Capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia was also examined in mice in which SOD levels were manipulated pharmacologically or genetically. Our results show that the spinal SOD-2 activity levels correlate with levels of capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia. Moreover, elevated mitochondrial superoxide accumulation after capsaicin treatment is, in part, attributable to inactivation of SOD-2 proteins. Thus, these data suggest that endogenous levels of mitochondrial SOD-2 determine the levels of spinal superoxide, which in turn determine the levels of central sensitization and, thus, capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia.Young adult male mice (20\u201325 g of body weight) of various stains were used for this study. Wild-type FVB/NJ mice and heterozygous SOD-2 knock-out (KO) mice [B6.129S7-Sod2tm1Leb/J] in the C57BL/6 background were purchased from Jackson Laboratory, and heterozygous SOD-2 transgenic mice (TG) in the C57BL/6 background originated from Ho et al. (1998). All heterozygous mice (SOD-2 KO and SOD-2 TG) were compared with wild-type littermates for all experiments. Animals were housed in groups of four to five in plastic cages with soft bedding and  access to food and water under a 12 h light/dark cycle. All animals were acclimated for 1 week before any experimental procedures. All experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas Medical Branch and are in accordance with the National Institutes of Health's .For injection of capsaicin, each mouse was anesthetized with isoflurane (2.0% for induction and 1.5% for maintenance) in a flow of O2 and placed in a prone position. Capsaicin solution (0.5%) was made by dissolving 5 mg of capsaicin (Sigma) in 1 ml of vehicle containing 20% alcohol and 7% Tween 80 in saline, immediately before injection. For behavioral testing, 5 \u03bcl of capsaicin solution was injected intradermally using a 30 gauge needle attached to a Hamilton syringe. The needle was inserted near the heel of the left hind foot and advanced to the middle of the plantar surface as shown in Figure 1. A successful injection was noted by the formation of a \u201cbleb\u201d \u223c2 mm in diameter. The insertion site was pressed for 1 min to prevent leakage of the solution after removal of the needle. Anesthesia was discontinued and the mice were aroused within 5 min and then returned to their cages. For SOD protein and activity analysis and ROS imaging, 25 \u03bcl of 0.5% capsaicin was injected into multiple sites of both the plantar and dorsal surface of the left hind foot to increase receptive fields of capsaicin responsive afferents and, thus, to maximize the number of affected neurons in the spinal cord.Foot withdrawal frequencies in response to von Frey stimuli were measured and used as an indicator of mechanical sensitivity. Tests were conducted blindly and foot withdrawal responses were assessed before and 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 24 and 48 h (sometimes 72 h) after intradermal capsaicin injection. For each test, the animal was placed in a plastic chamber on top of a mesh screen platform and was habituated for at least 10 min. Mechanical stimuli were applied from underneath to the plantar surface of the left hind foot. The mechanical sensitivity of the foot was determined by the frequency of positive foot withdrawal responses to 10 repetitive von Frey stimuli. The von Frey monofilaments of 2.48, 3.00, or 3.61 (vF#2.48, #3.0, or #3.61), which are equivalent to 0.03, 0.10, or 0.41 g force, respectively, were used for stimulation. For mechanical stimulation, a von Frey filament was applied perpendicular to the stimulation site with sufficient force to bend the filament for 2\u20133 s and then removed. An abrupt withdrawal with or without licking of the foot, during stimulation, or immediately after stimulus removal, was considered a positive response. Each test was composed of 10 stimuli for each area. The number of positive responses was converted into a percentage with 10 positive responses corresponding to 100%. Primary and secondary hyperalgesia were assessed as shown previously (Schwartz et al., 2008). In brief, primary hyperalgesia was assessed by applying von Frey filaments to site P in Figure 1, which is 2 mm distal from the injection site (site I). For secondary hyperalgesia, a von Frey monofilament was applied at the base and/or proximal part of the third and fourth toes (site S). This area is at a sufficient distance from the capsaicin injection site (\u223c7 mm), and is thus not directly affected by capsaicin, but becomes extremely sensitive and thus is identified as a site of secondary hyperalgesia.For direct transcutaneous intrathecal injection, a modified method (Lee et al., 2007) of the original intrathecal injection method (Hylden and Wilcox, 1980) was used. Mice were anesthetized (2.0% for induction and 1.5% for maintenance) with isoflurane in a flow of O2, placed in a prone position, and the hair on their back was clipped. The caudal paralumbar region, just cranial to the iliac crests, was securely held by the thumb and middle fingers of the left hand, and the index finger was placed on the tip of sixth lumbar (L6) spinous process, the highest point of the vertebral column. A 1.5-inch-long 30 gauge needle connected to a Hamilton syringe was positioned underneath the index finger with the beveled side facing upward in a forward direction. The needle was inserted into the tissue at a 45\u00b0 angle. The angle of the needle was maintained until the needle went through the fifth intervertebral space (L5\u2013L6) and \u201cslipped in\u201d causing a sudden lateral movement of the tail. Solution was injected at a rate of 1 \u03bcl/s. The needle was held in position for 10 s and removed slowly to avoid any outflow of the solution. Anesthesia was discontinued and the mice were aroused within 5 min and then returned to their cages.Mn (III) tetrakis(4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP; 5mg; Calbiochem) was dissolved in 2.5 ml of saline, and 100 \u03bcl of this solution was injected intraperitoneally per 20 g of body weight (10 mg/kg). The same volume of saline was used as a control. To determine the role of SOD in capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia, MnTBAP was administered either 0.5 h before (pretreatment) or 1.5 h after (posttreatment) capsaicin treatment. To examine the dose\u2013response, one of three doses of MnTBAP, 2 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg/kg of body weight, or saline was injected intraperitoneally, 1.5 h (posttreatment) after intradermal injection of capsaicin.Diethylthiocarbamate (DETC; 0.2 mg; Sigma) was dissolved in 4 ml of saline, and 5 \u03bcl of this solution was injected intrathecally (0.05 mg). The same volume of saline was used as a control. To determine the role of SOD in capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia, DETC was administered either 0.5 h before capsaicin treatment (pretreatment) or 1.5 h after (posttreatment). To examine the dose\u2013response, one of three doses of DETC, 0.01, 0.02, or 0.05 mg, or saline was injected intrathecally, 1.5 h (posttreatment) after intradermal injection of capsaicin.Either 0.2 mg of phenyl -tert-butylnitrone (PBN) or 0.5 mg of 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl (TEMPOL; Sigma) was dissolved in 1 ml of saline, and 5 \u03bcl was injected intrathecally 15 min after capsaicin injection (200 \u03bcg of PBN; 500 \u03bcg of TEMPOL). The same volume of saline was used as a control.At the time of tissue sampling, mice were anesthetized deeply with sodium pentobarbital (Nembutal, 75 mg/kg) and perfused through the aorta with cold saline for \u223c1 min. The L4\u20135 spinal cord segments were removed after laminectomy and divided into right (contralateral) and left (ipsilateral to capsaicin injection) halves and frozen immediately on dry ice. The spinal cord segments were homogenized, using a bead beater, in 100 \u03bcl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Base, 150 mm NaCL, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% Chaps, 2 mm EGTA, 1% protease inhibitor mixture). Lysates were centrifuged at 12,500 \u00d7  for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatants were collected and protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (BCA; Pierce). Protein (40 \u03bcg) was resuspended in 40 \u03bcl of Laemmli sample buffer and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and heated for 10 min. The samples were loaded in 15% SDS polyacrylamide gels. After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes and blocked. For detection of SOD-2, blots were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-SOD-2 (1:3000 dilution; Upstate Cell Signaling) and then incubated with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:3000 dilution; Bio-Rad). The specific complex was detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system. The density levels of SOD-2 bands were quantified by using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). Equal protein loading was determined using \u03b2-actin (1:10,000 dilution; Sigma) expression as a control.The L4\u20135 spinal cord segments were sampled after cold saline perfusion as described in the previous section. The spinal cord segment was homogenized, using a bead beater, in 100 \u03bcl of lysis buffer. After homogenization, solubilized extracts were sonicated and centrifuged at 12,500 \u00d7 . The supernatants were collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C immediately. Protein concentration was determined by BCA method, as described in Western blot analysis of SOD-2. Solubilized proteins (40 \u03bcg) were incubated with agarose-conjugated anti-nitrotyrosine antibody (Upstate Cell Signaling) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Agarose beads were collected by centrifugation at 12,500 \u00d7 , washed in PBS, and collected. The mixture of the beads-antibody and binding proteins complex was resuspended in 50 \u03bcl of Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol (Bio-Rad), and heated. The samples were loaded in 15% SDS-PAGE minigels. After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred electrophoretically to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad), and Western blots were performed as above. Mouse brain treated with peroxynitrite for 10 min (Upstate Cell Signaling) was used as a positive control.Tissue samples were homogenized in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, ph 7.4. The homogenates were centrifuged for 20 min at 12,500 \u00d7 ; supernatant was collected and stored on ice. Protein concentration was determined by BCA method as above. SOD activity was measured using a microtiter plate assay for SOD using a water soluble tetrazolium (WST-1) salt (Peskin and Winterbourn, 2000). The reagent mixture for detection consisted of the following: assay buffer: 1 mm diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (DTPA; Sigma), 1 mm hypoxanthine (Sigma), 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0; Catalase: 2 mg/ml (Sigma); WST-1: 50 \u03bcm (Dojindo Laboratories); and xanthine oxidase: 4.5 mU/ml (Sigma). Xanthine oxidase was added to the reaction mixture immediately before starting the assay. Samples were diluted 1:10, and each sample was pipetted in triplicates as well as standards. Reagent mixture (200 \u03bcl) per well was pipetted into each well and absorbance was read at 450 nm from time 0 min and every 10 min for 1 h on a microplate reader (model 680-UV, Bio-Rad). Bovine Cu/Zn SOD (Sigma) was used as a standard and final SOD concentrations of 0, 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 ng/well were used for the standard curve. SOD1 activity was inhibited, by performing the assay in the presence of 2 mm NaCN 30 min before assay.MitoSox Red (Invitrogen) was dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and saline to a final concentration of 33 \u03bcm. Under isoflurane anesthesia, 10 \u03bcl of MitoSox was injected intrathecally by using a direct transcutaneous intrathecal injection method described previously. Approximately 23 h after MitoSox injection, mice received an intradermal injection of either capsaicin (0.5%, 25 \u03bcl) or the same volume of vehicle on both the plantar and dorsal surfaces of the left hind foot. Mice remained under 1.5% isoflurane anesthesia for 30 min to suppress any side effects induced by capsaicin. Mice were perfused through the aorta with saline followed by fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde 1 h after capsaicin injection, and the L4\u2013L5 spinal cord segments were removed. The cord was postfixed 4\u201315 h in the perfusion fixative, equilibrated in 30% sucrose, cryosectioned at 30 \u03bcm, and mounted on gelatin coated slides. The sections were examined under a fluorescent microscope with a rhodamine filter. Two different regions of the dorsal horn were photographed from 10 randomly selected sections from each animal: the lateral part of laminas I-II and laminas III-V. Photographs were taken with a Q-Imaging Retiga 2000R digital camera attached to an Olympus BX50 microscope using a 63\u00d7 oil objective lens and saved as digital image files. The number of MitoSox-positive cellular profiles with distinctive nuclei (dark oval shaped space surrounded by red granules) was counted from these pictures.To identify spinothalamic tract (STT) neurons, a retrograde marker fluorogold (FG; Fluorochrome) was injected into the ventroposterior lateral thalamic nucleus (VPL). For FG injection, mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (75 mg/kg, i.p.) and placed in a stereotactic frame (Stoelting Company). A burr hole was made on the cranium at 1.5 mm posterior to the bregma and 1.62 mm lateral from the midline. A Hamilton syringe was inserted to 3.6 mm depth from the brain surface and 1 \u03bcl of FG (4% in d.w.) was injected into the VPL at a rate of 0.1 \u03bcl/min. Twenty minutes later, the needle was removed, the wounds were sutured, and the mice were returned to their cage after recovering from anesthesia. Three to four days later, mice were treated with MitoSox and capsaicin as described above and the spinal cord tissues were processed and examined. The spinal cord sections were examined under a fluorescent microscope with rhodamine and DAPI filters. FG labeled STT neurons were photographed for FG and MitoSox from 10 randomly selected sections from each animal. The number of double labeled, FG and MitoSox, STT neurons were counted in each animal and averaged in capsaicin ( = 5) and vehicle ( = 5) groups.Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM and were analyzed using the statistical program SigmaStat (Version 3.1, Systat Software). Statistical analyses for differences in changes over time in multiple groups were performed using two-way ANOVA with one repeated factor (time), followed by Duncan's  test. Differences of values in different groups were tested using the Student's  test (when comparing two groups) or the one-way ANOVA (when comparing more than two groups) followed by  pairwise multiple comparisons. All statistical tests were evaluated at an \u03b1 level of significance of 0.05.After an intradermal injection of capsaicin in mice, primary and secondary hyperalgesia were determined by applying a von Frey monofilament to sites P and S in Figure 1, respectively. It is well known that after capsaicin injection only mechanical, but no heat, secondary hyperalgesia develops; whereas, both mechanical and heat components are present in primary hyperalgesia (Torebj\u00f6rk et al., 1992; Willis, 2001). Using this feature, we attempted to confirm the sites testing for both primary and secondary hyperalgesia. Two hours after an intradermal capsaicin injection to the foot, thermal hyperalgesia developed, as shown by 44.5 \u00b1 7.31% decrease in foot withdrawal latency ( = 6;  < 0.05 by paired Student's  test) from baseline values, at the capsaicin injection site (site P), but there was no statistical difference in heat response at site S (85.1 \u00b1 6.72% from baseline value). However when mechanical sensitivity was measured in the same mice, mechanical hyperalgesia developed at both sites P and S similar to the results of all experiments in this study (Figs. 1\u20132). Therefore, the data confirm that these two tested sites P and S elicit primary and secondary hyperalgesia, respectively.Effect of a SOD mimetic, MnTBAP, on capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia in response to vF (#3.61). , Sites of capsaicin injection and behavioral testing in the mouse hind foot. For capsaicin injection, a 30-gauge needle was inserted at the heel of the foot (X) and advanced to the injection site (I), and capsaicin (25 \u03bcg in 5 \u03bcl of vehicle) was injected intradermally. Foot withdrawal frequencies in response to von Frey stimuli were measured at site P for primary hyperalgesia and at site S for secondary hyperalgesia. , , Posttreatment effect; , , pretreatment effect. ,The mean \u00b1 SEM ( = 6/group) of primary (, ) and secondary hyperalgesia (, ) are plotted against the postcapsaicin treatment time. MnTBAP [or vehicle saline (Sal)] was injected systemically (intraperitoneally) 1.5 h after or 0.5 h before (indicated by downward arrows) capsaicin injection (indicated by upward arrowheads) for posttreatments or pretreatments, respectively. MnTBAP reduced capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia in a dose-dependent manner but not primary hyperalgesia. *Values significantly different from corresponding values of the vehicle-treated group at  \u2264 0.05, by Duncan's  test after two-way repeated ANOVA. The data indicate that removal of superoxides exogenously supplemented by a SOD mimetic, reduces capsaicin induced secondary hyperalgesia. MnTBAP(Mn-T) doses: 2, 5, or 10 mg/kg body weight.Effect of a SOD inhibitor, DETC, on capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia in response to vF (#3.61). , , Posttreatment results; , , pretreatment results. The mean \u00b1 SEM ( = 6/group) of primary (, ) and secondary hyperalgesia (, ) are plotted against the postcapsaicin treatment time. DETC [or vehicle saline (Sal)] was injected intrathecally 1.5 h after or 0.5 h before (indicated by downward arrows) capsaicin injection (indicated by upward arrowheads) for posttreatments or pretreatments, respectively. DETC enhanced and prolonged capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia in a dose-dependent manner but not primary hyperalgesia. *Values significantly different from corresponding values of the vehicle-treated group at  \u2264 0.05, by Duncan's  test after two-way repeated ANOVA. The data indicate that superoxide accumulation caused by inhibition of SOD enhances and prolongs the capsaicin induced secondary hyperalgesia. DETC (D) doses: 0.01, 0.02, or 0.05 mg in 5 \u03bcl of saline.To test whether superoxide is involved in capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia, the effect of a SOD mimetic, MnTBAP, and a SOD inhibitor, DETC, was examined on pain. Systemic (intraperitoneal) MnTBAP (10 mg/kg) treatment, 1.5 h after capsaicin injection, had no effect on the primary hyperalgesia (Fig. 1). The same treatment, however, showed a significant reduction on the secondary hyperalgesia (Fig. 1), which lasted \u223c6 h. In a dose\u2013response study, both 5 and 10 mg/kg of MnTBAP produced graded antihyperalgesic effect, whereas, 2 mg/kg had no effect compared with the saline-treated group. The fact that a SOD mimetic produced antihyperalgesia only on secondary hyperalgesia suggests that superoxide is involved in central sensitization.Intrathecal injection of SOD inhibitor DETC (0.05 mg) 1.5 h after capsaicin treatment, in contrast, significantly enhanced and prolonged the secondary hyperalgesia but not the primary hyperalgesia (Fig. 2,). The enhanced hyperalgesia lasted up to 24 h with the highest dose tested (0.05 mg) but for 8 h with two lower doses (0.02 and 0.01 mg). In a dose\u2013response study, all three doses showed graded enhanced hyperalgesia compared with the saline-treated group. Because DETC would block SOD activity and lead to superoxide accumulation, the enhancement of capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia by DETC also supports the idea of superoxide involvement in central sensitization.Although posttreatment of either MnTBAP or DETC suggests that superoxide is involved in the maintenance of secondary hyperalgesia, it is not known whether superoxide is also critical for the development of capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia. To address this issue, mice were treated with either MnTBAP or DETC 0.5 h before capsaicin treatment and mechanical hyperalgesia was measured. Pretreatment with MnTBAP (10 mg/kg) significantly reduced the capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia (Fig. 1), whereas DETC (0.05 mg) increased both the duration and the magnitude of capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia (Fig. 2). Neither MnTBAP nor DETC had any effect on the development of capsaicin-induced primary hyperalgesia (Figs. 1, 2). These results suggest that superoxide is critical for not only the development but also the maintenance of capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia, thus suggesting a role of superoxide in central sensitization.Previous findings have indicated that the levels of superoxide in the spinal cord are increased in response to intradermal capsaicin. We considered two possibilities that could explain the spinal superoxide elevation: a decrease in SOD-2 protein levels and/or a decrease in SOD-2 activity levels independent of a change in SOD-2 protein levels. First, the total amount of SOD-2 protein in the spinal cord was measured by Western blotting. As shown in Figure 3, the levels of SOD-2 protein in the ipsilateral L4\u20135 spinal cord did not change significantly 1 h after capsaicin treatment compared with vehicle-treated mice. Thus, the data indicate that changes in the total SOD protein levels are not likely the cause of superoxide elevation.Total SOD-2 protein, N-SOD-2 protein levels, and SOD-2 activity levels in the L4/5 spinal cord. , Example of Western blot gel for SOD2 proteins. There is no change in the total amount of SOD2 proteins in the spinal cord 1 h after capsaicin injection into the paw compared with that of vehicle injection, and statistical analysis was done by nonpaired  test. , Example of Western blot gel for N-SOD2 proteins. One hour after intradermal capsaicin treatment (CAP-1 h), the inactivated N-SOD2 levels increase approximately three times compared with vehicle treatment (VEH-1 h). Treatment with ROS scavengers (PBN: 100 mg/kg; TEMPOL: 300 mg/kg) 15 min after capsaicin injection (CAP+PBN-1 h and CAP+TEMPOL-1 h), completely reversed N-SOD2 levels to normal levels. Five hours after capsaicin treatment (CAP-5 h), N-SOD2 levels were slightly higher than vehicle-treated (VEH-5 h) control mice but not significantly different. The data indicate that ROS accumulation in the spinal cord might be caused, in part, by inactivation of SOD2 by nitration. , The SOD2 activity levels were measured in six groups of mice ( = 12/group), and the average values (\u00b1SEM) are shown in . CAP-1 h and CAP-5 h: 1 and 5 h after capsaicin; VEH-1 h and VEH-5 h: 1 and 5 h after vehicle; CAP+PBN-1 h and CAP+TEMPOL-1 h: 1 h after capsaicin plus PBN or TEMPOL treatment; PBN or TEMPOL was injected systemically (intraperitoneally) 15 min after capsaicin. SOD activity levels were significantly reduced 1 h after capsaicin, then moderately recovered at 5 h compared with that of vehicle treatment. Capsaicin-induced reduction on SOD2 activity was completely recovered by treatment with a ROS scavenger, PBN or TEMPOL. *Values significantly different from corresponding values in the vehicle-treated group at  \u2264 0.05 ( = 12), by Duncan's  test after one-way repeated ANOVA. The data indicate that intradermal capsaicin induce the reduction in SOD2 activity in the spinal cord resulting from ROS elevation.In the next experiment, levels of SOD-2 activity in the spinal cord were examined with a microtiter plate assay for SOD using a WST-1 salt (Peskin and Winterbourn, 2000). SOD-2 activity levels in the spinal cord after various manipulations in mice are shown in Figure 3. One hour after intradermal capsaicin treatment (CAP-1 h), SOD-2 activity levels in the ipsilateral L4/5 spinal cord were greatly decreased compared with that of vehicle-treated mice. This decrease, however, was completely reversed when the mice were treated with ROS scavengers, PBN or TEMPOL, 15 min after capsaicin (CAP+PBN-1 h and CAP+TEMPOL-1 h). When spinal SOD-2 activity levels were measured 5 h after capsaicin treatment, the time mechanical hyperalgesia was significantly recovered from the peak response at 2 h after capsaicin treatment, SOD-2 activity levels also were significantly recovered from the lowest value at 1 h after treatment. The results show that spinal levels of SOD-2 activity, but not SOD-2 protein levels, were decreased after intradermal capsaicin and then recovered by ROS scavenger treatment, suggesting that ROS are involved in the reduction of SOD-2 activity. The data also indicate that the levels of SOD-2 activity are correlated with the amount of mechanical hypersensitivity. These findings suggest that decreased SOD-2 activity in the spinal cord, at least in part, results in elevation of superoxide and subsequently hyperalgesia.Because spinal SOD-2 activity levels were decreased without changes in protein levels, we speculated that the SOD-2 enzyme might have been inactivated. Inactivation of SOD can be caused via nitration by peroxinitrite under some oxidative stress conditions (Yamakura et al., 1998; Hylden and Wilcox, 1980; Salvemini et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2004; Muscoli et al., 2004). Therefore, the levels of nitrated SOD-2 (N-SOD-2) were measured in the L4/5 spinal cord of mice after various manipulations. The results of N-SOD-2 protein levels in the spinal cord are shown in Figure 3. The levels of N-SOD-2 in the ipsilateral L4/5 spinal cord were significantly increased (\u223c3-fold) 1 h after capsaicin treatment (CAP-1 h), compared with that of vehicle-treated mice. Five hours after capsaicin treatment (CAP-5 h), spinal N-SOD-2 levels were significantly reduced from the peak levels but still slightly higher than, but not significantly different from, the vehicle-treated mice (VEH-5 h). In addition, PBN and TEMPOL treatment in combination with capsaicin (CAP+PBN-1 h and CAP+TEMPOL-1 h) did not alter the spinal N-SOD-2 protein levels compared with that of vehicle-treated mice (VEH-1 h). These results suggest that the decrease in SOD-2 activity in the spinal cord after capsaicin treatment is caused by inactivation of SOD-2 by nitration. The significant reduction of N-SOD-2 levels by ROS scavengers also support the notion that elevated levels of ROS are involved in nitration of SOD-2.Previous findings indicate that spinal SOD activity levels are inversely correlated with the levels of the capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia. Because mitochondria is speculated as the primary source of neuronal ROS and SOD-2 is a mitochondria-specific antioxidant, we determined whether SOD-2 could modulate hyperalgesia by measuring capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia in mice whose SOD-2 expression was modified genetically. Two genetically altered lines of mice were used: heterozygous SOD-2 overexpressing transgenic mice (SOD-2 TG) and heterozygous SOD-2 underexpressing knock-out (SOD-2 KO) mice. Capsaicin-induced mechanical hyperalgesia was determined as described previously by measuring foot withdrawal frequencies in response to vF filament stimuli. Mechanical sensitivity was measured before and various times after a capsaicin treatment, and results are shown in Figures 4 and 5., Capsaicin-induced primary () and secondary () hyperalgesia in SOD-2 KO mice and ROS scavenger effect on primary () and secondary () hyperalgesia. The average foot withdrawal frequencies (\u00b1SEM,  = 10 per group) in response to vF (#3.61) stimuli are plotted against the postcapsaicin treatment (indicated by upward arrowheads) time. The capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia, both primary and secondary, was significantly enhanced and prolonged in SOD-2 KO mice compared with that of wild-type littermates. Posttreatment with a ROS scavenger, TEMPOL [500 \u03bcg in 5 \u03bcl of saline (Sal); indicated by downward arrow], 1.5 h after capsaicin, significantly reduced secondary hyperalgesia but not primary hyperalgesia. Asterisks (*), Values are significantly different from corresponding values in the control groups (wild-type mice in , ; saline group in , ) at  \u2264 0.05 by Duncan's  test after two-way repeated ANOVA., , Capsaicin-induced primary () and secondary () hyperalgesia in SOD-2 TG mice in response to vF (#3.61). The capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia, both primary and secondary, were significantly reduced in SOD-2 TG mice compared with wild-type littermates. The effect is severer for secondary hyperalgesia than primary hyperalgesia; thus, secondary hyperalgesia is almost nonexistent. Asterisks (*), Values are significantly different from corresponding values in the wild-type littermates (Wt CAP) at  \u2264 0.05 ( = 10) by Duncan's  test after two-way repeated ANOVA.In SOD-2 KO mice, capsaicin injection produced significantly enhanced and prolonged (up to 48 h) secondary hyperalgesia compared with wild-type littermates (Fig. 4). Primary hyperalgesia also was increased modestly (Fig. 4). When SOD-2 KO mice were treated with TEMPOL, 1.5 h after capsaicin treatment, secondary hyperalgesia quickly subsided 30 min after TEMPOL treatment, returning to normal levels within 5 h after capsaicin treatment (Fig. 4). These results suggest that reduced levels of SOD-2 in SOD-2 KO mice allowed increased superoxide accumulation and enhanced secondary hyperalgesia. To confirm whether the enhanced hyperalgesia is caused by reduced SOD-2 function in these mice, the levels of SOD-2 activity in the spinal cord were also measured after capsaicin treatment in SOD-2 KO mice. As shown in Figure 6, the basal endogenous levels of SOD-2 activity were significantly lower in SOD-2 KO mice (SOD-2 KO VEH) compared with their wild-type littermates (Wt VEH). One hour after capsaicin treatment, SOD-2 activity levels were further decreased in SOD-2 KO mice (SOD-2 KO CAP) and, thus, significantly lower than that of capsaicin-treated wild-type littermates (Wt CAP) or of vehicle-treated SOD-2 KO mice (SOD-2 KO VEH).SOD2 activity levels in the L4/5 spinal cord in SOD-2 KO and SOD-2 TG mice with and without intradermal capsaicin treatment. The endogenous SOD2 activity levels are significantly lower in SOD-2 KO mice (SOD-2 KOVEH) and significantly higher in SOD-2 TG mice (SOD-2 TGVEH) compared with wild type (Wt-VEH). Capsaicin treatment (CAP-1 h), SOD2 activity levels significantly decreased in Wt and SOD-2 KO mice but not in SOD-2 TG mice. *Values are significantly different between two linked groups at  \u2264 0.05 ( = 12) by Bonferroni's  test after one-way repeated ANOVA. ns, Nonsignificant.In SOD-2 TG mice, the levels of capsaicin-induced primary and secondary hyperalgesia were significantly reduced, especially the secondary hyperalgesia, compared with that of wild-type littermates (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the basal levels of SOD-2 activity were approximately twice in SOD-2 TG mice (SOD-2 TG VEH) compared with that of wild type (Wt VEH), and their levels did not decrease significantly after capsaicin treatment (Fig. 6). These results suggest that high levels of SOD-2 activity in SOD-2 TG mice do not allow superoxide accumulation beyond normal levels even after capsaicin treatment, and thus prevent the development of secondary hyperalgesia. These results are consistent with the notion that manipulating endogenous SOD-2 levels can either enhance or reduce superoxide accumulation in the spinal cord, which in turn will either increase or decrease central sensitization, and thus influence the levels of hyperalgesia.Previous data indicate that superoxide accumulation in the spinal cord is correlated to the levels of endogenous SOD-2 activity. To determine whether mitochondrial superoxide levels in the spinal dorsal horn were modified by SOD-2 activity levels, the number of dorsal horn neurons showing increased superoxide was examined by using redox sensitive dye MitoSox. The reduced form of colorless MitoSox was injected intrathecally \u223c24 h before sacrificing to allow dye to penetrate into the spinal cord and to sequester in the mitochondria. One day later, mice were treated with either capsaicin or vehicle and then killed by perfusion fixation 1 h after capsaicin treatment. This study was done in SOD-2 TG and SOD-2 KO mice and their wild-type littermates with and without capsaicin treatment, and the results were compared among the different groups.When the spinal cord sections were examined, oxidized MitoSox labeling was detected as red fluorescent granules scattered in the cytoplasm of cells (Fig. 7), confirming our previous findings (Schwartz et al., 2008). From a glance, it was clear that the number of MitoSox-positive cells varied greatly among different tissues (Fig. 7). Thus, quantification was done for the number of MitoSox-positive cells in the superficial (laminas I-II) and deep (laminas III-V) layers of the spinal dorsal horn. The results of these studies are shown in Figure 7,  and . In addition, we also examined that the number of MitoSox-positive STT neurons (Fig. 7), representing ascending pain projection neurons. MitoSox-positive STT neurons were increased significantly in capsaicin-treated mice (76% of total STT neurons) compared with that of vehicle-treated control group (52%)., MitoSox-labeled L5 spinal dorsal horn (lamina V) sections in various groups. MitoSox labeling is identified as red fluorescent granules in the cytoplasm of cellular profiles. The round/oval-shaped black space, which is enclosed by red granules, represents the nucleus. The numbers of MitoSox-positive cells are increased after capsaicin treatment in both Wt and SOD-2 KO mice but not in SOD-2 TG mice compared with that of vehicle-treated mice. In addition, the numbers of MitoSox-labeled cells are more numerous in capsaicin-treated SOD-2 KO mice compared with capsaicin-treated Wt mice. The number of MitoSox-positive cells were counted in the superficial (laminas I-II) and deep (laminas III-V) dorsal horn of various groups of mice ( = 7/group), and the results are shown in  and . MitoSox-positive cells are very small in VEH mice in all three groups (Wt, SOD-2 KO, and SOD-2 TG). After CAP treatment, the number of MitoSox-positive cells increases significantly in Wt and SODKO mice but not in SODTG mice. This increase is far greater in SODKO+/\u2212 mice compared with Wt mice. *Values are significantly different between two linked groups at  \u2264 0.05 by Bonferroni's  test after one-way repeated ANOVA. , MitoSox and fluorogold double-labeled ROS producing STT neuron. The STT cell identified by fluorogold label () also shows MitoSox label () as merged in . The data show that some STT cells show enhanced ROS production in response to intradermal capsaicin. ns, Nonsignificant.Intradermal capsaicin (CAP) induced a significant increase in the number of MitoSox-positive cells in the spinal dorsal horn compared with that of vehicle treatment (VEH). In SOD-2 KO mice, the number of MitoSox-positive cells is slightly higher, but not significantly different, than wild-type mice with vehicle treatment. However, the number of MitoSox-positive cells was increased 2\u20133-fold after capsaicin treatment (SOD-2 KO CAP) compared with that of vehicle treatment (SOD-2 KO VEH). This increase in SOD-2 KO mice is significantly higher than that in wild-type mice with capsaicin treatment. In SOD-2 TG mice, there was no difference in the number of MitoSox-positive cells after capsaicin treatment as well as basal levels compared with that of vehicle-treated wild-type littermates. The results confirmed that the levels of endogenous SOD-2 determine the amount of superoxide accumulated by the mitochondria, which in turn induce central sensitization and secondary hyperalgesia.Our previous study has shown that increased levels of spinal ROS are critical for the maintenance of capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia (Schwartz et al., 2008), suggesting ROS involvement in central sensitization. The present study extends this work by showing that mitochondrial superoxide is one of the major sources of elevated spinal, but most likely not peripheral, ROS in capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia, and inactivation of SOD-2 by nitration contributes toward maintaining increased levels of mitochondrial superoxide. The fact that the level of capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia is correlated with the level of SOD-2, further supports the idea that mitochondrial superoxide controls the level of central sensitization. Increased and decreased number of MitoSox-positive dorsal horn neurons, correlated with changes in capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia in SOD-2 KO and SOD-2 TG mice, is consistent with the hypothesis that decreased mitochondrial SOD-2 activity level significantly contributes to spinal superoxide increase and thus hyperalgesia.Importance of SOD-2 and superoxide in a rat inflammatory pain model has been proposed by others (Muscoli et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2004), who suggested that SOD-2 in the spinal cord and superoxides in both the spinal cord and the peripheral tissue are important in the carrageenan-induced inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia in the rat. The present study extends this earlier proposal by showing that (1) spinal SOD-2 are important in capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia in mice; (2) determination of hyperalgesia by the levels of endogenous SOD-2 is clearly demonstrated in mice in which SOD-2 levels are manipulated genetically; (3) imaging data provide a direct evidence of decreased/increased accumulation of spinal superoxides because of increased/decreased levels of SOD-2 in relation to capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia in mice; and (4) the spinal cord seems to be the major action site of superoxides and SOD-2 in capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia, suggesting the role of superoxides and SOD-2 for the central sensitization process.To demonstrate that elevation of superoxide levels in the spinal cord is a key for the development and maintenance of capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia, we show that dismutation of superoxide by an exogenously supplied SOD mimetic, MnTBAP, reduces the secondary hyperalgesia, but not the primary hyperalgesia, in capsaicin-treated mice. Thus, the data suggest the main function of MnTBAP is the reduction of central sensitization by removing superoxide from the spinal cord. In contrast, the capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia is significantly enhanced by the SOD inhibitor DETC. This result further supports the hypothesis that SOD determines the levels of superoxide in the spinal cord, which in turn causes central sensitization and thus secondary hyperalgesia. Thus, it is clear that pain modulation by a SOD mimetic or a SOD inhibitor is mainly achieved through the reduction or increase of superoxide in the spinal cord, respectively, in capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia. However, the possibility of ROS-induced sensitization of supraspinal regions, which in turn influence spinal sensitization, cannot be excluded because an intracerebroventricular injection of ROS scavengers produces a small but significant antihyperalgesic effect in capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia (Lee et al., 2007).Whereas the present study suggests that the spinal cord appears to be the main site of action of a SOD mimetic in capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia, another study has shown that the SOD mimetic, M40403, reduces carrageenan-induced inflammation and hyperalgesia through both peripheral and central mechanisms (Wang et al., 2004). We are not clear why these two studies show different results. One reason for the difference in models could be that the peripheral inflammatory factor is relatively strong as in carrageen-induced hyperalgesia (Wang et al., 2004), whereas it is small in acute capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia as shown in this study.Another important point related to the MnTBAP and DETC study is that both drugs are nonspecific in terms of their subcellular action sites; thus, they will change superoxide levels not only in the mitochondria but also in the cytoplasm and extracellular space. This issue was further probed in this study by using genetically manipulated SOD-2 KO and SOD-2 TG mice to explore the role of mitochondrial SOD. One other issue on the use of MnTBAP is that it can also scavenge peroxynitrite (Hachmeister et al., 2006) in addition to superoxide; thus, it is possible that the reduction of secondary hyperalgesia by MnTBAP may be caused by the removal of peroxinitrite. Future studies are warranted by using more specific SOD mimetics when they become available.The present study also shows that SOD-2 activity levels are altered in the spinal cord after intradermal capsaicin injection without reducing the total SOD-2 protein levels, thus suggesting that inactivation of SOD-2 is important rather than changes in protein levels. Nitration of SOD is one of the modes by which SOD is inactivated (Yamakura et al., 1998; Macmillan-Crow and Cruthirds, 2001; Echtay et al., 2002; Muscoli et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2004; Demicheli et al., 2007). SOD nitration can be reversed by removal of either superoxide or nitric oxide, inhibiting the formation of peroxynitrite and peroxynitrite-mediated protein nitration (Akizuki et al., 2000; Salvemini et al., 2001; Fries et al., 2003). In line with this idea, a previous study has shown that intraplantar injection of carrageenan induces thermal hyperalgesia (Salvemini et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2004) and increases nitration of spinal SOD-2 (Wang et al., 2004), and a SOD mimetic, M40403, reverses these effects (Salvemini et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2004). Increased spinal SOD-2 nitration is also found after intrathecal injection of NMDA, and this effect is reversed by a systemic administration of a SOD mimetic (Muscoli et al. 2004). The present study also confirms that both increased SOD-2 nitration and decreased SOD-2 activity in the spinal cord coincide with the capsaicin-induced secondary mechanical hyperalgesia. Thus, our data are in agreement with previous studies in which SOD-2 nitration in the cord is critical for hyperalgesia. The reversal of hyperalgesia and SOD-2 activity levels by a SOD mimetic is in agreement with the known reversal process of nitrated SOD-2 by removing superoxide from the spinal cord.Previous studies (Muscoli et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2004) have suggested that mitochondrial SOD, SOD-2, is critical for hyperalgesia. This point is further illustrated by using genetically manipulated SOD-2 KO and SOD-2 TG mice in the present study. In SOD-2 KO mice, the SOD-2 protein and activity levels are significantly lower and the magnitude of capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia is significantly greater compared with that of their wild-type littermates. The effects are opposite in SOD-2 TG mice, in which the level of SOD-2 activity is high in the spinal cord, and the capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia is almost nonexistence. Thus, the data indicate that mitochondrial superoxide accumulation, resulting from the insufficiency of mitochondrial antioxidant SOD-2, is critical for hyperalgesia. It is important to note that in SOD-2 TG and SOD-2 KO mice, levels of primary hyperalgesia were also modestly affected. This suggests that SOD-2 manipulations change to some extent the physiological properties of the primary afferents that contribute to primary hyperalgesia. Furthermore, increased and decreased numbers of MitoSox-positive dorsal horn neurons in response to intradermal capsaicin in these SOD-2 KO and SOD-2 TG mice, respectively, confirm that mitochondrial superoxide generation is the major driver of ROS elevation in the spinal cord.Although it is evident that elevated superoxide levels in the mitochondria of dorsal horn neurons are critical for secondary capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia, the exact mechanism of neuronal sensitization by mitochondrial superoxide is not known. Possibilities include deregulation of membrane potentials because of lipid peroxidation (Wang and Thayer, 2002; Choi et al., 2004) or modification of cellular signal transduction pathways (Sluka et al., 1997a; Palecek et al., 2002). Considering that hyperalgesia and SOD-2 nitration is reversible within 30 min after treatment with a SOD mimetic, it is likely that superoxide is involved in the modification of reversible cellular signaling process rather than permanent damage. It has been shown that central sensitization involves activation of ligand-gated ion channels, the substance-P receptor neurokinin-1 (NK1)-R (Sluka et al., 1997b; Palecek et al., 2002), metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGLUR) (Adwanikar et al., 2004; Park et al., 2006), and tyrosine kinase receptors (trkB and Eph) (Ren and Dubner 2007). Furthermore, ROS are considered to be small messenger molecules that modify cellular signaling pathways (Kamata and Hirata 1999; Maher and Schubert 2000). Thus, it is likely that an elevated level of ROS leads the redox status of dorsal horn neurons toward oxidation and, thus, changes the signal transduction pathways toward sensitization. In addition, functional loss of glutamate transporters and glutamine synthase (Trotti et al., 1996, 1999; G\u00f6rg et al., 2005) can lead to increased glutamate levels in the synaptic cleft and overstimulation of the NMDA receptor. Thus, the functional loss of transporters and enzymes in the presence of excess ROS may also contribute toward central sensitization. Future studies are thus warranted to explore detailed redox-sensitive signal transduction pathways in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.In conclusion, our findings suggest that superoxide is particularly important in the sensory processing in the spinal cord in capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia. Our studies also support that SOD-2 nitration is a critical mechanism that maintains elevated superoxide levels in the spinal cord after capsaicin treatment. Finally, our findings suggest a therapeutic potential for the manipulation of spinal SOD-2 activity in pain conditions.This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants R01 NS31680 and P01 NS11255.The authors declare no competing financial interests.Thank you for sharing this Journal of Neuroscience article.NOTE: We request your email address only to inform the recipient that it was you who recommended this article, and that it is not junk mail.

Occasionally, these singular genetic lesions have been assembled into meaningful molecular pathways and neural circuitries. For the most part, however, these genes and their expression patterns in the CNS remain fragmented, demanding new clues from continued mutant screens. From a behavioral screen for long-term memory (LTM) mutants, we have identified  (), which encodes a novel protein. Mutations of  specifically disrupt LTM, leaving earlier memory phases intact. The role of  appears physiological rather than developmental, because acutely induced expression of a + transgene in adults rescues the mutant's LTM defect. More interestingly, induced expression of + specifically in mushroom bodies (MBs), but not in the ellipsoid body of the central complex, is sufficient to rescue the mutant LTM defect. This suggests a role for  in the MB during olfactory memory formation. We also provide evidence that BEN interacts genetically in both synaptic transmission and LTM formation with SCAMP, a synaptic protein known to be involved in vesicle recycling.Like other biological processes, complex behaviors (i.e., learning and memory) are shaped by selective pressure and are remarkably conserved across animal phyla. Such a genetic perspective provides the conceptual motivation to use \u201csimple\u201d model systems initially to discover specific genes involved in a given behavioral phenomenon and then to manipulate each gene's expression or function, thereby unraveling the relevant molecular and neuronal mechanisms. Olfactory memory in  is a well established model system to study the genetic and neuronal architecture of associative learning. Of particular relevance, many genes identified from this model system have mammalian homologs with similar functions (Margulies et al., 2005), or, conversely, genes first discovered to be involved in mammalian plasticity also appear to be involved in associative learning in the fly (Xia et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2007, 2008; Bolduc et al., 2008). Therefore, lessons we learn from the neurogenetics of olfactory memory in flies should be relevant to our understanding of human cognition.Past work on pavlovian olfactory memory in  has begun to elucidate the underlying molecules and circuits (Margulies et al., 2005; Keene and Waddell, 2007). To date, two observations are apparent. First, behavioral plasticity depends on a large fraction of the neuron's proteome (Ashraf et al., 2006). A biological pathway from synaptic dopamine and/or glutamatergic transmission through gene transcription to local protein translation is emerging as a central mechanism of long-term memory (LTM) formation (Petersen et al., 1997; Dubnau et al., 2003; Schwaerzel et al., 2003; Ge et al., 2004; Presente et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2007). More complete connections among genes in this network remain to be discovered, however. Second, distinct neuroanatomical structures underlie olfactory memory formation, including the antennal lobe (AL), the mushroom body (MB), and the ellipsoid body (EB) (Heisenberg et al., 1985; Connolly et al., 1996; Zars et al., 2000; Pascual and Preat, 2001; Akalal et al., 2006; Krashes et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2007). Moreover, imaging studies have revealed neural activities that potentially underlie this behavioral plasticity. Olfactory learning generates (1) one short-lived \u201cmemory trace\u201d in the AL (Yu et al., 2004); (2) two additional, more persistent traces in dopaminergic or in dorsal paired medial neurons, both of which innervate MB neurons (Waddell et al., 2000; Riemensperger et al., 2005; Yu et al., 2005); (3) a fourth trace in the MB \u03b1\u2032 lobe, which is associated with short- to middle-term memory (Wang et al., 2008); and (4) a fifth trace, specific to axons of the MB \u03b1 lobe, only after LTM formation (Yu et al., 2006). Additional anatomies and neural activities involved in memory storage or retrieval have not yet been discerned.To expand our knowledge of genetic pathways and neural circuits, we conducted a behavioral screen for mutants defective in LTM after pavlovian olfactory learning (Lu et al., 2007; Qian et al., 2007) and identified the  gene (), which encodes a novel protein. Although BEN is expressed throughout the brain, induced expression of a + transgene in MB is sufficient to rescue the mutant's LTM defect. The  mutant also is defective in synaptic transmission at the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Perusal of a protein interaction database suggested that BEN interacts with SCAMP, a protein involved in vesicle recycling.  mutants also show defects in synaptic transmission (Fernandez-Chacon and Sudhof, 2000; Lloyd et al., 2000). We confirmed a functional interaction between BEN and SCAMP by showing defects for both LTM formation in adults and synaptic transmission at the larval NMJ in flies heterozygous for mutations in both genes.Transposon mutagenesis was performed as described in previous work (Lu et al., 2007; Qian et al., 2007). A PlacW autosomal mutator in a  balancer chromosome was used to generate X-linked transposant strains. Two thousand twenty-one adult-viable homozygous strains were screened for defective 24 h memory after spaced training using a pavlovian olfactory task (Tully et al., 1994). After outcrossing to  () for at least five generations to equilibrate genetic backgrounds and to remove most second-site mutations and after blind and balanced retesting, 11 candidate mutants were discovered with reliable 24 h memory defects. Based on molecular, genetic and behavioral characterizations of mutant strain 20816039 presented herein, we renamed the novel gene, ,  (\u201cben\u201d means \u201cstupid\u201d in Mandarin) and the original mutant strain . The strain w[*]P{GawB}NP4013/FM7c was obtained from Kyoto Stock Center (Kyoto Institute of Technology, Kyoto, Japan). The strains  (Bellen et al., 2004) and  (Lloyd et al., 2000) were obtained from Bloomington Stock Center (Indiana University, Bloomington, IN). The *; (7018-GAL80ts), *;{,  (7019-GAL80ts) (McGuire et al., 2003),  (hs-GAL4),  (MB247),  (c739), and  (Feb170) drivers were extant stocks in our laboratory. All these strains were outcrossed with  () flies for at least five generations to equilibrate genetic backgrounds.  and  were gifts from the laboratory of Dr. A. DiAntonio (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO) and were crossed for five generations with  balancer flies, which themselves had been outcrossed with  (). All the flies, if not mentioned specifically, were reared at 25\u00b0C and 60% relative humidity with a 14/10 h light/dark cycle. The  (), a Canton-S strain isogenic for the X, second and third chromosomes (Yin et al., 1994), served as a \u201cwild-type\u201d control in all our experiments. Various genetic crosses generated the genotypes tested. Virgin  homozygotes were crossed with  males or  and hiw males for the genetic complementation experiments. Virgin ;hs-Gal4 homozygotes were crossed with UAS-+4\u20138 males for transgenic rescue. Virgin ;UAS-+4\u20138 homozygotes were crossed with Gal80ts; 247, c739 or Feb170 males for spatiotemporal rescue experiments. For experiments using the X-linked Feb170 driver,  flies were bred first by crossing  virgins with Feb170 males. Virgin F1 females (/+,Feb170) then were crossed with FM7a males, and the miniwhite-carrying progeny females with darker eye color (presumably  recombinants) were crossed singly to FM7a males to generate a pure-breeding stock. The putative  stock was confirmed by (1) detecting the  genomic insertion with PCR and (2) demonstrating the presence of  by crossing the flies to UAS\u2013green fluorescent protein. Virgin  or  homozygotes were crossed with  males for the epistasis experiments. Virgin ;hs-Gal4 homozygotes were crossed with ;UAS-+4\u20138 for the epistatic rescue experiment.Genomic DNA was isolated from homozygous  mutants, digested to completion with EcoRl (NEB), and \u201cplasmid rescued\u201d as described previously (Dubnau et al., 2003). DNA sequence was obtained by automated sequencing (Applied Biosystems) with a primer directed against the 3\u2032 long terminal repeat (LTR) of PlacW (5\u2032-CGCCGACAAGCTTTGCGTACTCGC-3\u2032). A blast of genomic DNA flanking the 3\u2032 LTR identified the genomic insertion site of the PlacW transposon.The expected full-length + cDNA was amplified by Pfu-polymerase (Stratagene) from cDNA clone SD04373 (DGRC) and sequenced to confirm its correctness. I restriction sites were added to both ends of the PCR product, which then was subcloned into a pUAST germ-line transformation vector. Transformation was performed by BestGene. Ten transformants were obtained and outcrossed with  () for at least five generations to equilibrate genetic backgrounds to each other and to the  () controls. Quantitative PCR determined that the UAS-+4\u20138 line, with the transgene inserted on the second chromosome, showed the highest level of expression for the + transgene. This line thus was chosen for the rescue experiments.RNA was isolated from adult fly heads of each genotype with Trizol according to the manufacturer's protocols (Invitrogen). PolyA+ RNA was selected with oligo dT-magnetic beads (Dynal Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Northern blots were prepared using standard techniques, as in the study by DeZazzo et al. (2000). In brief, 5 \u03bcg of polyA+ RNA per sample was electrophoresed through a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel via 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid buffer. Gels were blotted onto nylon membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). P32-labeled probes were generated by random priming with (1) reverse transcription-PCR-generated fragments of , , or  predicted exons or (2) an R1/HIII restriction fragment from the  gene (O'Connell and Rosbash, 1984). The resulting PCR fragments then were gel purified (Qiagen) before making radiolabeled probes.Total RNA was isolated from \u223c2000 adult fly heads using Trizol total RNA isolation reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized with Expand Reverse transcriptase (Roche Diagnostics) and oligo-dT primers. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with the PRISM 7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). TaqMan probes for TATA-binding protein (TBP) (control) and appropriate probes for , , and  were synthesized by Applied Biosystems. Data analysis was performed from quadplex independent samples.Whole-mount immunolabeling of 2- to 3-d-old adult brains was performed as described previously (Chiang et al., 2001, 2002). Briefly, dissected brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature overnight, transferred to 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS with 2% Triton X-100 at a room temperature, and vacuumed for 1 h. Fixed tissue then was blocked for 2 d at 4\u00b0C in PBS containing 2% Triton X-100 and 10% normal goat serum (NGS) and successively incubated for 2 d each (with washing between) at 4\u00b0C in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% NGS, and (1) the mouse anti-LacZ monoclonal antibody (1:200 dilution) or the rabbit anti-SCAMP polyclonal antibody (1:200 dilution) or both, or (2) a fluorescence-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200 dilution) and/or goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200 dilution). Next, the brain was cleared and mounted in FocusClear (Pacgen) and imaged with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. For larvae brain and NMJ staining, the same procedure was followed except for changing the Triton X-100 concentration from 2% to 0.2%.Acute heat-shock induction was performed according to previously published protocols (Xia et al., 2005). Briefly, flies were collected and incubated at 25\u00b0C overnight before heat-shock treatment. The next day, flies were transferred to empty glass vials and submerged for 45 min in a 37\u00b0C water bath. After heat shock, flies were transferred to fresh food vials at 25\u00b0C and allowed a 3 h recovery period before training/testing. For experiments using Gal80ts (and Gal4), flies were raised at 18\u00b0C and kept either at 30\u00b0C or at 18\u00b0C as adults for 3 d before training, during training, during the retention interval and during testing.We quantified olfactory associative learning by subjecting 1- to 4-d-old adult flies to a pavlovian conditioning procedure (Tully and Quinn, 1985; Tully et al., 1994; Yin et al., 1994). Typically, after one training session, memory retention in normal flies drops to near zero within 24 h. To produce longer-lasting memory, flies were subjected to repetitive training sessions, either massed (10 sessions with no rest interval) or spaced (10 training sessions with a 15 min rest between each). After training, flies were transferred to food vials (at 18\u00b0C) for 24 h before testing (25\u00b0C) in the T maze. Performance indices (PIs) are normally distributed. Behavioral data were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA with subsequent pairwise planned comparisons between group means. For each experiment, the critical  value (\u03b1 = 0.05) was adjusted for the number of pairwise comparisons made (Bonferroni's correction).Olfactory acuity was quantified by exposing naive flies to each odor (octanol or methylcyclohexanol) versus air in the T maze. After 120 s, the number of flies in each arm of the T maze was counted, and the PI was calculated for each odor as reported (Tully et al., 1994). Shock reactivity was quantified in naive flies by inserting electric grids into both arms of the T maze and delivering shock pulses to one of the arms. Flies were transported to the choice point of the T maze, allowing them to choose between the two arms. After 120 s, the center compartment was closed, trapping flies in their respective arms. Individual PIs were calculated as for olfactory acuity. Data were analyzed as above.Synaptic currents were recorded from muscle 12 in segment 3 or 4 of third instar larvae (Jan and Jan, 1976; Singh and Wu, 1989) using two-electrode voltage clamp as described previously (Wu and Haugland, 1985; Singh and Wu, 1989). Both the voltage electrode and the current electrode were filled with 3 m KCl with a resistance in the range of 5\u201310 M\u03a9. All electrophysiological recordings were performed at room temperature (19\u201323\u00b0C). Stimulation of the precut motor nerve in excitatory junction current (EJC) experiments was achieved by 1 ms positive current stimulation of a loop of motor nerve in a suction electrode. The stimulation threshold was determined by varying stimulation intensity until the amplitude of junction currents appeared. Stimulation intensity was set 1.5 times the threshold. Both spontaneous miniature EJCs (mEJCs) and evoked EJCs were recorded in 0.4 mm Ca2+ Stewart saline (HL-3) (Stewart et al., 1994). All data were acquired at a clamping voltage of \u221280 mV, using an Axoclamp 2B amplifier (Molecular Devices) in conjunction with pClamp6 software. Consecutive events recorded every 2 min were measured per cell using MiniAnal (Synaptosoft) and averaged to determine the mean mEJC amplitude and frequency. Evoked EJCs were measured from 20 stimulations and analyzed by MiniAnal software. Statistical significance was evaluated as above.We screened 2021 homozygous adult-viable PlacW transposants for defects in 24 h memory after spaced training and identified strain 20816039 as one of 11 candidate mutants (Lu et al., 2007; Qian et al., 2007). We named this mutant strain , which means \u201cstupid\u201d in Mandarin, and specified the mutation as . Whereas 1 d memory after spaced training was impaired significantly in the  mutant, 1 d memory after massed training (ARM) was not (Fig. 1), suggesting that LTM but not ARM was disrupted (Tully et al., 1994). Memory retention at 5, 30, or 180 min after a single training session also was normal in  mutants (Fig. 1), further indicating that early memory (short-term memory and middle-term memory) also was not affected (Tully et al., 1996).Mutations of  disrupt LTM formation. , One-day memory after spaced training (10 spaced) or massed training (10 massed) was quantified in control (+/+) and  or  () homozygous mutants. After spaced training, mean memory scores (PI) of both mutants were significantly lower than control ( < 0.001 for both  and ). After massed training, however, mean memory scores of both homozygous mutants did not differ significantly from that of the control ( = 0.066 and 0.180 for  and  respectively). These data establish the specificity of the  mutant for LTM rather than ARM.  = 6 PIs for each group. , One-day memory after spaced (10 spaced) or massed (10 massed) training was quantified in the control (+/+), the heteroallelic / (/) mutant, and the heterozygous /+ or /+ () flies. After spaced training, the mean memory score for the heteroallelic fly was significantly lower than the other two heterozygous flies or the control fly ( = 0.002, 0.026, and 0.009 for +/+, /+, and /+, respectively). After massed training, the mean memory score for the heteroallelic fly was not significantly lower than the other two heterozygous flies or the control fly ( = 0.250, 0.698, and 0.345 for +/+, /+, and /+, respectively). These data establish that disruption of the  gene per se is responsible for the LTM defect.  = 8 PIs for each group. , One-day memory after spaced training (10 spaced) in the control fly (+/+), in the homozygous  mutant (/), and in flies homozygous for a precise excision of the  P-element insertion (). The mean memory score of the / mutant again was significantly lower than the control ( < 0.001), but that for  flies was not ( = 0.775). These data confirm that the P-element insertion, and not a second-site mutation, was responsible for the LTM defect of the  mutant.  = 6 PIs for each group. , Memory retention was quantified at 5, 30, and 180 min after one training session in the control (+/+) or the / mutant. Mutant and control flies did not differ significantly at any time point ( = 0.066, 0.632, and 0.892 for 5, 30, and 180 min, respectively).  = 6 PIs per group. These data indicate that learning or early memory were normal in the mutant. Error bars indicate SEM. Asterisks indicate  < 0.05.As a result of the molecular-genetic characterization of the  mutant (see below), we identified a second putative allele in strain  ().  and  each were recessive to +, and they failed to complement each other for 1 d memory after spaced training (Fig. 1). In contrast,  complemented two different alleles of  (Fig. S1,, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). We also generated a precise excision of  and showed a reversion of the mutant LTM defect in this  homozygote (Fig. 1). Finally, normal performance of the  mutant 5 min after training suggested that it also had normal sensorimotor responses to odors (positive and negative conditioned stimuli) and footshock (unconditioned stimulus). Nonetheless, we assessed olfactory acuity and shock reactivity directly, confirming that these task-relevant behavioral responses were normal in the  mutant (Table 1). Together, these behavior-genetic data establish that disruption of  impairs LTM formation specifically.Sensorimotor controls for olfactory learning in the  mutantPlasmid rescue of the PlacW transposon in the  mutant, followed by sequencing of genomic DNA flanking the PlacW insertion site, identified the  PlacW to be inserted 21 bp 5\u2032 of the  transcript. Functional analysis of  was complicated by the fact that  and  both reside in the largest intron (\u223c33 kb) of , which is involved in synaptic development and function (Fig. 2) (Wan et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2005). We analyzed these three genes' expression levels by Northern blot analysis and real-time PCR (Fig. 2,; Fig. S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). The mRNA levels of  were decreased significantly in the  homozygote and were nearly abolished in the  homozygote, which has an EPgy2 element inserted in the first exon (Bellen et al., 2004). In contrast, mRNA levels of  and  were normal in  or  homozygotes (Fig. S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), suggesting the  PlacW insertional mutation specifically disrupts the  gene and not its neighboring genes. P-element alleles disrupt expression of . , The genomic structure of  located along with  within an intron of . Also shown in expanded view are (1) the PlacW insertion site () of the  mutant, (2) the PEPgy2 insertion site () of the  mutant, and (3) the PGawB insertion () of the  mutant. The directions of enhancer-driven transcription within each P element are indicated by an arrow.

Two null mutations of ,  (ND8) and  (ND9), also are indicated. , Northern blot analysis of the  transcript in the control fly (+/+), the / mutant, and the / (/) mutant. mRNA expression is almost undetectable in the / mutant and is dramatically reduced in the  mutant compared with the control fly. In contrast, mRNA expression of a control gene, , is similar among mutant and control genotypes, indicating that similar total amounts of mRNA were loaded into each lane. , Quantitative analysis of mRNA in the control fly (+/+), the / mutant, and the / (/) mutant from independent samples. Both the homozygous / mutant and the / mutant showed significantly lower expression of  than the control fly ( < 0.001 for both homozygous mutants). Error bars indicate SEM. Asterisks indicate  < 0.05.We have not yet been able to identify antibodies specific to BEN even after several attempts; consequently, we have not determined the subcellular distribution of BEN. Nevertheless, we were able to assess in which neurons of the CNS  likely is expressed by using the  reporter protein within the PlacW transposon of the  mutant, along with the  reporter protein in strain  (), which contains a PGawB transposon inserted in the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of  (Fig. 3,). In contrast to the negative signal observed in wild-type flies, immunostaining for both anti-LacZ and anti-GAL4 in the corresponding flies revealed widespread expression in the adult brain, with higher levels in MB Kenyon cells (Fig. S3,, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Merged confocal images of the anti-LacZ (perinuclear) and anti-GAL4 (cytosolic) signals showed coexpression of these reporter proteins in some Kenyon cells (Fig. 3). Thus, the overlapping expression of the  PlacZ and  PGawB reporter genes suggest that  is expressed in Kenyon cells of the MB.LTM defects of  mutant are rescued by acute induction of transgenic UAS-+4\u20138 in MB. , The LacZ reporter gene within the  transposon and the GAL4 reporter gene within the  reporter gene were expressed together in the / (/) heteroallelic mutant. Immunostaining reveals anti-LacZ (red, perinuclear) and anti-GAL4 (green, cytosolic) confocal signals in most, if not all, Kenyon cells (KC) of the MB. The merged signals (yellow) clearly show coexpression throughout the KC bodies. (Because the GAL4 reporter gene does not carry a nuclear localization signal, its expression extends throughout the KC neuropil, unlike the lacZ reporter.) CA, Calyx. Scale bar, 50 \u03bcm. , The anti-LacZ (red) and anti-GAL4 (green) confocal signals throughout the adult brain of the / (/) mutant were merged (yellow), also revealing widespread colocalization in the central brain outside of MBs. Scale bar, 50 \u03bcm. , One-day memory after spaced (10 spaced) training was quantified in wild-type control +/+ males (+), control +/Y;UAS-;+/+ males (UAS-+), and transgenic mutant ;UAS-;hsGal4/+ males (;+;hsGal4) with (HS+) or without (HS\u2212) heat shock 3 h before training. Without heat shock, the mean memory score of the transgenic mutant was significantly lower than that of the control flies ( = 0.033). With heat shock, however, the mean memory score of the transgenic mutant and the control did not differ ( = 0.847). These data established that universal induction of the + transgene in adult brain is sufficient to rescue the LTM defect in the  mutant.  = 8 PIs for each group. , Quantitative PCR of the  transcript in control +/Y;UAS-;+/+ males (UAS-+) and transgenic mutant ;UAS-+;hsGal4/+ males (;UAS-+; hs-Gal4) 3 h after heat shock (HS+) revealed a significantly higher level of  mRNA expression in the transgenic mutant than in the control ( < 0.001). Without heat shock (HS\u2212), however, the  mRNA level is significantly lower than normal ( < 0.001). mRNA values among all genotypes were normalized to TBP mRNA levels.  = 4 determinations for each group. , Quantitative PCR of the  transcript in control +/Y;UAS-;+/+ males (UAS-+) and transgenic mutant ; UAS-+;hsGal4/+ males (; UAS-+;hs-Gal4). In contrast to  mRNA levels,  mRNA levels were similar between mutant and control with (HS+) or without (HS\u2212) heat shock ( = 0.194 and 0.778, respectively). mRNA values among all genotypes were normalized to TBP mRNA levels.  = 4 determinations for each group. , One-day memory after spaced training (10 spaced) was quantified in control +/Y;+/GAL80ts;+/247 males (GAL80ts;247), transgenic mutant ;UAS-+ (;UAS-+) males, and transgenic mutant ; UAS-+/;+/247 (;+/GAL80ts;247) males with the + trans-gene expression controlled by a the  MB-GAL4 driver and the GAL80ts GAL4 repressor. Flies were raised at the permissive temperature (18\u00b0C), and memory was evaluated either at the same temperature or after 3 d at the restrictive temperature (30\u00b0C). At the permissive temperature, when GAL80ts successfully represses MB-GAL4-driven expression of UAS-ben+, mean memory scores for the ;UAS-+;247 and ;UAS-+ transgenic mutant males both were significantly lower than that for the GAL80ts;247 control flies ( < 0.001 and  = 0.010, respectively). At the restrictive temperature, when GAL80ts fails to repress MB-GAL4-driven expression of UAS-+, mean memory scores for the ;UAS-+/;247 and ;UAS-+ transgenic mutant males were similar to, or significantly lower than, that for the GAL80ts;247 control males ( = 0.830 and  = 0.040, respectively). These data establish that acute induction of the + transgene in MBs is sufficient to rescue the LTM defect in the  adult mutant.  = 6 PIs for each group. , One-day memory after spaced training (10 spaced) was quantified in control +/Y;+/c739;+/GAL80ts males (c739;GAL80ts), transgenic mutant ;UAS-+/+;+/+ males (;UAS-+), and transgenic mutant ;UAS-+//GAL80ts/+ males (;+) with the + transgene expression controlled by a second MB-GAL4 driver, , and the GAL80ts GAL4 repressor. At the permissive temperature, mean memory scores for the ;UAS-+/GAL80ts;c739 and ;UAS-+ transgenic mutant males were significantly lower than that for the GAL80ts;c739 control male ( = 0.005 and 0.037, respectively). At the restrictive temperature, mean memory scores for the ;UAS-+/GAL80ts;c739 and ;UAS-+ transgenic mutant males were similar to, and significantly lower than, that for the GAL80ts;c739 control male ( = 0.069 and  = 0.002, respectively). These data also confirm that acute induction of the + transgene in MBs is sufficient to rescue the LTM defect of the  mutant.  = 6 PIs for each group. , One-day memory after spaced training (10 spaced) was quantified in control +/Y;+/c305a;+/GAL80ts males (c305a;GAL80ts), transgenic mutant ;UAS-+/+;+/+ males (;UAS-+), and transgenic mutant ;UAS-+//GAL80ts/+ males (;+) with the + transgene expression controlled by a third MB-GAL4 driver, , and the GAL80ts GAL4 repressor. At the permissive temperature, mean memory scores for the ;UAS-+/c305a;GAL80ts and ;UAS-+ transgenic mutant males were significantly lower than that for the c305a;GAL80ts control male ( = 0.005 and 0.037, respectively). At the restrictive temperature, mean memory scores for the ;UAS-+/c305a;GAL80ts and ;UAS-+ transgenic mutant males were similar to, and significantly lower than, that for the c305a;GAL80ts control male ( = 0.069 and  = 0.002, respectively). These data confirm yet again that acute induction of the + transgene in MBs is sufficient to rescue the LTM defect of the  mutant.  = 6 PIs for each group. , In contrast, 1 d memory after spaced training (10 spaced) was quantified in the control +/Y;UAS-+/+;+/Gal80ts male (UAS-+;Gal80ts), transgenic mutant +/+;+/+ males, (Feb170), and transgenic mutant Feb170/Y; UAS-ben+4\u20138/+;+/Gal80ts males (Feb170;UAS- ben+;Gal80ts) with expression of the + transgene controlled by an EB-GAL4 driver  and the GAL80ts GAL4 repressor. At the permissive temperature, mean memory scores for the  and UAS-+;Gal80ts transgenic mutant males remained significantly lower than that for the UAS-+;Gal80ts control male ( = 0.004 and 0.038, respectively). At the restrictive temperature, mean memory scores for the  and UAS-+;Gal80ts transgenic mutant males also remained significantly lower than that for the UAS-+;Gal80ts control male ( = 0.028 and 0.024, respectively). These data show that acute induction of the + transgene in EBs is not sufficient to rescue the LTM defect of the  mutant.  = 6 PIs for each group. , One-day memory after spaced (10 spaced) training was quantified in control +/Y;hsGal4/+ males (hsGal4) and the transgenic mutant ;UAS-++;+/hsGal4 males (;+;hsGal4) with (HS+) or without (HS\u2212) heat shock 1 h before testing. The mean memory scores are significantly lower in the transgenic mutant either with heat shock or without heat shock compared with the corresponding control male ( < 0.001 for both). These data established that pan-neural induction of the + transgene in adults during memory retrieval is not sufficient to rescue the LTM defect of the  mutant.  = 8 PIs for each group. Error bars indicate SEM. Asterisks indicate  < 0.05.To establish an acute role for  in LTM, we first attempted rescue of the  mutant LTM defect by driving the expression of a UAS-+ transgene (UAS-+4\u20138) with a hs-Gal4 driver, which induces rapid, ubiquitous expression of + in the adult brain after heat shock. Flies were either heat shocked (25\u201337\u00b0C for 45 min with 3 h recovery) or kept at 25\u00b0C during the experimental procedure, and 1 d memory after spaced training was quantified for all groups. In the absence of heat shock, 1 d memory in the ;UAS-+;hs-Gal4 transgenic mutant males was significantly lower than that in the UAS-+4 control males (Fig. 3). When trained 3 h after heat shock, in contrast, transgenic mutants and controls showed similar 1 d memory (Fig. 3). Heat shock produced no significant effects in wild-type flies (Fig S4, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), thereby allowing the conclusion that heat shock-induced expression of UAS-+ produced a specific rescue of the mutant LTM defect.Consistent with these behavioral rescue data,  mRNA expression in the absence of heat shock was significantly lower in ;UAS-+;hs-Gal4 transgenic mutant males than in the UAS-+ control males and was elevated dramatically in transgenic mutants 3 h after heat shock (Fig. 3). Given 's location within an intron of , we also evaluated whether heat shock affected  mRNA expression levels in transgenic mutant or control males; it did not (Fig. 3).Having established a physiological, rather than a developmental, role for  during adult LTM formation, we returned to the question of where in the adult brain 's function might be critical for LTM formation. The widespread expression patterns of the  and  reporter genes in the adult brain did not provide any clues as to where  might be required for LTM formation. Based on the literature, however, two anatomical regions seemed possible: MBs (Connolly et al., 1996; Zars et al., 2000; Dubnau et al., 2001; Pascual and Preat, 2001; McGuire et al., 2003; Krashes et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2007; Qian et al., 2007) or the EB of the central complex (Wu et al., 2007). We first used the Gal4 driver , which expresses strongly in \u03b1/\u03b2 and \u03b3 lobes and weakly in \u03b1\u2032/\u03b2\u2032 lobes, of MB (Schwaerzel et al., 2002). We combined  with tub-Gal80ts to control UAS-+ transgene expression temporally as well as spatially (McGuire et al., 2003). One-day memory after spaced training was quantified for all groups. When trained and tested at 18\u00b0C (GAL80ts inhibits GAL4), 1 d memory in ;UAS-+/Gal80ts;247 transgenic mutant males and in the ;UAS-+ control mutant males was significantly lower and than in Gal80ts;247 control males (Fig. 3). When trained and tested at 30\u00b0C (GAL80ts fails to inhibit GAL4), 1 d memory in the transgenic mutant males was significantly higher than in mutant control males and was not different from the wild-type control males (Fig. 3). A temperature shift from 18 to 30\u00b0C in control flies produced no effects on 1 d memory (data not shown), therefore suggesting a specific effect of the UAS-+ transgene.This initial result on rescue of the mutant LTM defect with transgenic + expression restricted to MBs was confirmed using two additional Gal4 drivers with preferential expression in MBs. With both  and  (Krashes et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008), we again saw induced rescue of the  LTM defect (Fig. 3,). We also induced expression of UAS-n+ in the EB of the central complex by using the Gal4 driver  but did not observe any rescue of the mutant LTM defect (Fig. 3) (Wu et al., 2007, but see Krashes and Waddell, 2008). Finally, we investigated 's role during memory retrieval rather than memory storage. Transgenic hs-Gal4;UAS-+ mutant males were heat shocked (from 25 to 37\u00b0C for 45 min) and then were allowed to recover at 25\u00b0C for 1 h right before evaluating 1 d memory after spaced training. Transgenic ;UAS-+;hs-Gal4 mutant males showed similar, defective 1 d memory after heat shock (or when not heat shocked) compared with UAS-+4\u20138control males (Fig. 3). Together, these observations suggest that  functions specifically in the adult MB (most likely in \u03b1/\u03b2 an \u03b1\u2032/\u03b2\u2032 lobes) during LTM consolidation.Other memory mutants have demonstrated defects in synaptic plasticity at the larval NMJ (Saitoe, 2001). The  transposon is inserted in a large intron of , however, mutations of which are known to disrupt synaptic structure at the larval NMJ (Wan et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2005). Consequently, we first had to rule out any disruptive effects that the  mutation may have exerted on  function. We clearly detected abnormally high numbers of branches and boutons in homozygous  mutants. Such synaptic structure was normal in the  mutant, however, which also complemented the defects of  (Fig. S1,, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Along with our results from genetic complementation for LTM, these data also confirm that these  mutations do not affect  function.We next evaluated synaptic function in the  mutants by recording from muscle 12 (segment 3 or 4) of the third instar larva (Jan and Jan, 1976; Singh and Wu, 1989). Postsynaptic responses to both spontaneous and evoked transmitter release were quantified. The mean amplitude of spontaneous mEJCs, also called quantal size, typically is considered to be a measure of postsynaptic sensitivity to transmitter. The mean amplitude of evoked EJCs, in contrast, depends on both postsynaptic receptor function and the amount of transmitter released from the presynaptic terminal. We found the mean mEJC amplitude for  homozygotes to be normal (Fig. 4), and the mean mEJC frequency for this genotype was slightly lower than normal, but not significantly so (Fig. 4). In contrast, the mean evoked EJC for  homozygotes was significantly lower than normal, by nearly 35% (Fig. 4). Thus, the quantal content (number of vesicles released, which is estimated by dividing the mean EJC amplitude by the mean mEJC amplitude) at the synapse of the  mutant was only \u223c65% of wild type. This defect in evoked EJCs also was apparent in the ;UAS-+;hs-Gal4 transgenic mutant and the ;UAS-+ mutant control in the absence of heat shock (Fig. 4). When measured 3 h after a 45 min heat shock, however, the mean amplitude of evoked EJCs was rescued fully (i.e., normal) in the transgenic mutant (Fig. 4). Considering quantal content is an indication of presynaptic function (Landmesser, 1998), our data suggest that  is required presynaptically during synaptic transmission. Given our parallel behavioral rescue for LTM, our data suggest that a similar defect in synaptic transmission in the CNS may underlie the LTM impairment of the  mutant. functions together with  during synaptic transmission at the larval NMJ. , Representative traces of spontaneous mEJCs were recorded from muscle 12 on larval segment 3/4 in wild-type control (+/+) or  mutant larvae. Similar mEJC amplitudes and frequencies were observed between these two genotypes. Calibration: 2 nA, 384.0 ms. , Representative traces of evoked EJCs were recorded from muscle 12 on larval segment 3/4 in wild-type control (+/+) or the  mutant. Mutant traces obviously were lower than those for the control. Calibration: 20 nA, 15.4 ms. , Evoked EJC amplitude was quantified in transgenic mutant UAS-+4\u20138/+; hsGal4/+ males (+;hsGal4) and transgenic control mutant ;UAS-+4\u20138/+ males (;+). Each genotype was treated either with (+hs) or without (\u2212hs) heat shock. Without heat shock, evoked EJC amplitudes were similarly low ( = 0.222). With heat shock, however, the evoked EJC amplitude in the transgenic mutant UAS-+4\u20138/+; hsGal4/+ males was significantly higher than that in transgenic control ;UAS-+4\u20138/+ mutant males ( < 0.001). These data establish that pan-neural induction of the + transgene is sufficient to rescue the synaptic transmission defect of the  mutant.  = 10 segment recordings for each group. Error bars indicate SEM. Asterisks indicate  < 0.05.Guided by the NMJ defect of the  mutant, we perused BioGrid, a public database of gene interactions (Stark et al., 2006). We discovered from yeast two-hybrid experiments that BEN interacts with CdsA, which itself interacts with SCAMP (Giot et al., 2003). The  gene encodes a secretory carrier membrane protein family member that has been shown in  to be involved in vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release (Hubbard et al., 2000; Littleton, 2000).Based on this bioinformatics, we evaluated a functional connection between  and  using a classic test for genetic epistasis, quantifying 1 d memory after spaced training in  or  double heterozygotes. Although the  mutation alone appeared to be recessive (LTM was normal), 1 d memory after spaced training was significantly lower than normal in both double heterozygotes (Fig. 5). This defect also appeared specific for LTM, because 1 d memory after massed training and 5 min memory after one training session were normal in both double heterozygotes (Fig. 5,). Importantly, this epistatic LTM defect could be rescued in ;UAS-+;hs-Gal4 transgenic heterozygotes by heat shock-induced overexpression of + (Fig. 5), indicating that the interaction between  and  is physiological rather than developmental. and  function together during LTM formation. , One-day memory after spaced (10 spaced) or massed (10 massed) training was quantified in the wild-type control (+/+), the +/ heterozygote, and the  or  double heterozygotes. After spaced training, the mean memory score for the +/ heterozygote did not differ from that of the control ( = 0.720), whereas mean memory scores for both double heterozygotes ( or ) were significantly lower than normal ( < 0.001 for both). After massed training, mean memory scores did not differ among all four genotypes ( > 0.05). These data establish that  functions together  specifically during LTM formation.  = 8 PIs for each group. , Memory retention was quantified 5 min after one training session in the wild-type control (+/+), the +/ heterozygote, and the  or  double heterozygotes. No significant differences were detected among all the genotypes ( > 0.05).  = 8 PIs per fly group. , One-day memory after spaced training (10 spaced) was quantified in the control /+;hsGal4/+ (/+;hsGal4) and the transgenic P1;UAS-+4\u20138/+;hsGal4/+ double heterozygote (/P1;UAS-+;hsGal4). These two genotypes were trained without heat shock or 3 h after heat shock. Without heat shock, the mean memory score of the transgenic double heterozygote was significantly lower than the control ( = 0.002). With heat shock, however, mean memory scores between these two genotypes did not differ ( = 0.231). These data establish that pan-neural induction of the + transgene is sufficient to rescue the LTM defect produced by an epistatic interaction between the  and P1 mutations.  = 8 PIs for each group. Error bars indicate SEM. Asterisks indicate  < 0.05.We also asked whether  and  functioned together during synaptic transmission at the larval NMJ. Double labeling of larval CNS with anti-lacZ and anti-Scamp in  flies implied that both are expressed in a similar group of motor neurons (Fig. 6, arrowheads), and SCAMP immunostaining was apparent in axons of the motor neurons (Fig. 6). The mean amplitudes of evoked EJCs at the larval NMJ in + or /+ heterozygotes were similar to that in the wild-type (+/+) control (Fig. 6). In contrast, the / homozygote or the / double heterozygote showed significantly lower EJC amplitudes, similar to that produced by the  homozygote (Fig. 6). Thus, SCAMP appears to function together with BEN during synaptic transmission at the NMJ. and  function together during synaptic transmission at the NMJ. , Whole-mount ventral ganglia of the / homozygous mutant were immunostained with anti-LacZ (red, perinuclear) and anti-Scamp (green) antibodies, revealing widespread expression of both  and  in neuronal soma. A merged confocal image (yellow) showed coexpression in motor neurons (arrowheads). (Scamp also showed expression throughout the neuropil.) Scale bar, 50 \u03bcm. , SCAMP (green) also expressed in axons and synaptic boutons (white arrowheads) of / motor neurons innervating the larval NMJ. Scale bar, 50 \u03bcm. , Evoked EJC amplitude was quantified in the wild-type control (+/+), in two homozygous mutants (/ and /), in two heterozygotes (+/ and +/), and in the +/+ double heterozygote (). Mean evoked EJC amplitudes for the two homozygous mutants and for the double heterozygote were significantly lower than normal ( = 0.011, 0.001, and 0.004, respectively), whereas mean evoked EJC amplitudes of the two heterozygotes were similar to that for the control ( = 0.863 and 0.740, respectively). These data indicate that  and  function together during synaptic transmission.  = 8 segments for each group.The  gene resides in a genomic region, near CG5541 within the large intron of  (Fig. 2). To rule out potential second-site effects, we have shown that (1) two independently derived mutations of  yield LTM defects when homozygous (Fig. 1); (2) a heteroallelic combination of these two mutations also disrupts LTM (Fig. 1); (3) two independently derived mutations of  do not yield LTM defects when homozygous (Fig. S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material); (4) heteroallelic combinations of either of these  mutations with  do not yield LTM defects (Fig. S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material); (5) a heteroallelic combination of  and  does not disrupt synaptic structure at the NMJ, as is the case for  mutants (Fig. S1,, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material); (6) Northern blot analyses show reduced levels of mRNA for , but not for  or , in  or  mutants (Fig. 2,; Fig. S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material); (7) induced expression of a + transgene is sufficient to rescue the LTM defect of the  mutant (Fig. 3,,); and (8) induced expression of a + transgene yielded an increase in  mRNA but had no effect on  mRNA (Fig. 3,). Together, these data establish that the LTM defect of the  mutant derives from disruption of the  gene.LTM is induced after spaced, but not massed, training (Tully et al., 1994). Massed training induces a cycloheximide-insensitive form of long-lasting memory (ARM), whereas spaced training induces ARM along with a cycloheximide-sensitive LTM (Tully et al., 1994). Thus, normal 1 d memory after massed training suggests that learning and earlier memory is normal in  mutants (Fig. 1,), a notion also supported by normal memory 5, 30, and 180 min after one training session (Fig. 1) and normal sensorimotor responses (Table 1) in the mutant. This conglomerate effect on LTM formation is not unique for , because disruptions of several other genes also appear specifically to impair LTM (Yin et al., 1994; Pascual and Preat, 2001; Comas et al., 2004; Ge et al., 2004; Presente et al., 2004; Didelot et al., 2006; Lu et al., 2007; Qian et al., 2007).The LTM defect of  can be rescued by induced expression of a + transgene in adults (Fig. 3). Together with the observations that gross structural defects were not detected in the  mutant, either in the adult brain (Figs. 3, 5, and data not shown) or at the NMJ (Fig. S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), inducible rescue indicates a physiological, rather than a developmental, role for  during LTM formation. So where in the adult brain is  required to function during LTM formation? Although an antibody against Ben is not yet available, we nonetheless have been able to identify neurons likely to express BEN by assessing the common expression patterns of two reporter genes in the  (LacZ) and  (Gal4). Immunostaining for LacZ and Gal4 revealed widespread coexpression in the CNS (Fig. 3,) and PNS (Fig. 6). Given that the  transposon is inserted in the 5\u2032 UTR of , this coexpression pattern likely identifies the cells in which BEN is expressed. Although this widespread expression pattern did not provide any anatomical clues for BEN's role in LTM formation, it did suggest that BEN may be expressed in the Kenyon cells of MB.Extensive evidence has established the MB to be involved in olfactory memory formation (Heisenberg et al., 1985; Nighorn et al., 1991; Han et al., 1992; Skoulakis et al., 1993; de Belle and Heisenberg, 1994; Connolly et al., 1996; Han et al., 1996; Grotewiel et al., 1998; Cheng et al., 2001; Philip et al., 2001; Comas et al., 2004; Didelot et al., 2006; Folkers et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2007; Krashes et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2007; Qian et al., 2007; Xia and Tully, 2007), whereas some emerging evidence also has implicated the EB (Wu et al., 2007) (but see Krashes and Waddell, 2008). Based on these anatomical clues, we used the GAL4/GAL80ts system to restrict induced expression of + to either MB or EB. The LTM defect of  mutants was rescued with expression of a + transgene in MBs (Fig. 3) but not in EBs (Fig. 3). Thus,  may join , , and  as an LTM-specific gene with its relevant function localized to the MB (Didelot et al., 2006; Lu et al., 2007; Qian et al., 2007; cf. Keleman et al., 2007).A bioinformatic search suggested that BEN and SCAMP may function together. SCAMPs are ubiquitous components of secretory vesicles in exocrine glands (Cameron et al., 1986; Brand et al., 1991; Laurie et al., 1993) and are present in recycling synaptic vesicles, where they function in clathrin-mediated vesicle budding via the asparagine-proline-phenylalamine tripeptide repeat domain (Brand et al., 1991; Brand and Castle, 1993; Hussain et al., 1999; Okamoto et al., 1999; Sengar et al., 1999; Fernandez-Chacon and Sudhof, 2000).With this clue, we turned to the well characterized larval NMJ to assess a potential role for  in synaptic function. We showed that BEN and SCAMP are coexpressed in some motor neurons (Fig. 6). Immunostaining of SCAMP was weak, however, detecting Scamp in some motor neuron terminals but not in cell bodies in the larval ganglion (Fig. 6). Development of synaptic structure appeared normal in the  mutant (Fig. S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), but a defect in evoked EJC was apparent in both  (Fig. 4) and  homozygous mutants (Fig. 6). Importantly, evoked EJCs also were defective in  double heterozygotes (Fig. 6), a classic assessment for genetic epistasis (functional interaction).Genetic dissection of developmental plasticity at the NMJ, in fact, continues to yield results generally parallel to both behavioral plasticity in  and in mammals (Saitoe, 2001). For example, increased neural activity or cAMP signaling can produce changes in both synaptic structure and function at the NMJ (Zhong and Wu, 1991; Zhong et al., 1992). Neural excitability activates JNK (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase) and AP-1, which then induces cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-dependent changes in synaptic function (Davis et al., 1996; Sanyal et al., 2002, 2003; Etter et al., 2005) and CREB-independent, but ERK(extracellular signal-regulated kinase)- and ADF1-dependent, changes in synaptic structure (Schuster et al., 1996; DeZazzo et al., 2000; Hoeffer et al., 2003). Because disruption of  leads to defects in synaptic function rather than structure,  appears to fall into the CREB-dependent genetic pathway for synaptic plasticity.We evaluated a potential epistatic interaction between BEN and SCAMP during LTM formation.  or  heterozygotes showed normal 1 d memory after spaced and massed training.  double heterozygotes, however, displayed a defect in 1 d memory after spaced training but not after massed training (Fig. 5) or when tested immediately after a single training session (Fig. 5). Significantly, the LTM defect of the  double heterozygote was rescued by induced expression of the + transgene (Fig. 5), establishing that the functional interaction between  and  is physiological rather than developmental. To our knowledge, this is the first  demonstration that  is involved in behavioral plasticity.Our findings have established that (1) 's function in MB is sufficient for LTM formation, (2)  and  work together during synaptic transmission at the larval NMJ, and (3)  and  cooperate during adult LTM formation. These observations suggest the hypothesis that proper synaptic transmission in MBs may be crucial to LTM formation. Results from several other studies are consistent with this notion. MBs display persistent oscillations in neural activity in naive flies, which are disrupted in  (memory) mutants (Rosay et al., 2001). Within MBs, persistent neural activity is branch specific (Yu et al., 2005, 2006). Output from \u03b1 lobes appears required for LTM formation (Pascual and Preat, 2001; Isabel et al., 2004). Activity within the \u03b1\u2032/\u03b2\u2032 lobes is required for memory formation, whereas that in the \u03b1/\u03b2 lobes is involved with retrieval (Dubnau et al., 2001; McGuire et al., 2001; Yu et al., 2006; Krashes et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2007). Our results with  conform to this emergent view. The adult LTM defect of the  mutant is rescued via inducible expression of a + transgene in either \u03b1/\u03b2 lobes or \u03b1\u2032/\u03b2\u2032 lobes. This implies that  is involved in the requisite synaptic transmission underlying both memory formation and retrieval. Thus, our failure to see transgenic rescue of memory retrieval in  mutants resides in the fact that memory formation nonetheless remained disrupted in this experiment. Our results predict that other mutations of genes, which are involved in synaptic transmission and which are expressed in MBs, also may yield (1) LTM-specific defects and (2) MB-sufficient rescue thereof. Perhaps this cellular dysfunction (abnormal neural activity) is the unifying phenotype underlying all olfactory memory genes with critical function localized to the MB.This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (973 #2005CB522503) to Z.X., by the National Basic Research Project (973 #2006CB500800), the Tsinghua-Yue-Yuen Medical Sciences Fund to Y.Z., and by Dart Neuroscience LLC to T.T.

To elucidate such actions, we used the adenoassociated virus (AAV) system to alter  gene expression in the DMH and examined the effects of these alterations on food intake and energy balance as well as explored its downstream signaling pathway. We found that AAV-mediated overexpression of NPY in the DMH of lean rats increased food intake and body weight, and exacerbated high-fat diet-induced obesity. Knockdown of NPY expression in the DMH via AAV-mediated RNA interference ameliorated the hyperphagia, obesity, and diabetes of Otsuka Long\u2013Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats. NPY knockdown in the DMH produced a nocturnal and meal size-specific feeding effect. Moreover, we found that knockdown of DMH NPY expression in intact rats reduced NPY content in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and affected within-meal satiation. DMH NPY knockdown increased the feeding inhibitory and NTS c-Fos responses to peripheral administration of cholecystokinin. Together, these results indicate that DMH NPY plays an important role in modulating food intake and energy balance and its dysregulation causes disordered energy balance leading to obesity.Hypothalamic peptide signaling systems play key roles in the control of energy balance. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a potent hypothalamic orexigenic peptide. Central administration of NPY causes robust increases in food intake and body weight and, with chronic administration, can eventually produce obesity (Clark et al., 1984; Levine and Morley, 1984; Stanley and Leibowitz, 1984; Stanley et al., 1986; Zarjevski et al., 1993). Although NPY immunoreactivity is widely distributed throughout the hypothalamus (Chronwall et al., 1985; Gray and Morley, 1986),  hybridization histochemistry has revealed that -expressing neurons are primarily localized in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) (White and Kershaw, 1990; Bi et al., 2003). The actions of ARC NPY in the controls of food intake and body weight have been well studied. ARC NPY serves as a neural signal that integrates hormonal (such as leptin and ghrelin) and nutrient signals to modulate food intake and body weight (Elmquist et al., 1999; Nakazato et al., 2001; Spiegelman and Flier, 2001; Schwartz and Porte, 2005). NPY neurons in the ARC project to the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and lateral hypothalamus (LH) and act on local neurons to affect food intake and body weight (Elmquist et al., 1999). In support of this view, adenoassociated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of antisense  cRNA in the ARC of adult rats decreases ARC NPY expression and results in decreases in food intake and body weight (Gardiner et al., 2005). Moreover, AAV-mediated ectopic overexpression of NPY within the PVN or the LH results in increases in food intake and body weight with different durations and mechanisms of action (Tiesjema et al., 2007).The functions of DMH NPY in the regulation of energy balance are less clear. We and other investigators have reported that  gene expression is induced or significantly elevated in the DMH of rats in response to lactation (Smith, 1993), chronic food restriction (Bi et al., 2003), and increased physical activity (Kawaguchi et al., 2005). Induction or overexpression of  in the DMH has also been found in several rodent models of obesity including the lethal  yellow  (Kesterson et al., 1997), melanocortin 4 receptor knock-out (Kesterson et al., 1997), tubby (Guan et al., 1998a), diet-induced obese (Guan et al., 1998b), and brown adipose tissue-deficient obese mice (Tritos et al., 1998), as well as the Otsuka Long\u2013Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats (Bi et al., 2001). Despite these findings, existing data to date are correlational and the role of DMH NPY in mediating such effects has yet to be determined.Here, we sought to ascertain the role of DMH NPY in energy balance by using the AAV system to alter DMH NPY signaling via either increased or decreased  gene expression in the DMH. We demonstrate that alterations in DMH NPY signaling have bidirectional effects on food intake and body weight. Moreover, we identify an action of DMH NPY projections to the brainstem in modulating within-meal satiation signaling that may underlie the overall actions of DMH NPY in feeding control.AAV-293 cells were purchased from Stratagene and used for viral preparation. Cells were cultured in DMEM growth medium (containing 4.5 g/L glucose, 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate, and 4 mm l-glutamine; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum.Male Sprague Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Male OLETF rats and age-matched male lean Long\u2013Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats were obtained as a generous gift from the Tokushima Research Institute, Otsuka Pharmaceuticals (Tokushima, Japan). Rats were individually housed in hanging wire mesh cages and maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 6:00 A.M.) in a temperature-controlled colony room (22\u201323\u00b0C) with  access to tap water and standard laboratory rodent chow, except where noted. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at The Johns Hopkins University.The AAV Helper-Free System (Stratagene) was used for viral preparation. The full length of rat  cDNA was first cloned into the pAAV-IRES-hrGFP vector to make a recombinant NPY expression plasmid (pAAVNPY), so that the plasmid contains the  gene driven by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and the marker gene of humanized  green fluorescent protein (hrGFP) translationally controlled by the internal ribosome entry site (IRES), flanked by AAV2 inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) (see Fig. 1). For viral packaging, three plasmids of pAAVNPY, pHelper (carrying adenovirus-derived genes), and pAAV-RC (carrying AAV-2 replication and capsid genes) were cotransfected into the AAV-293 cells according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). The vector pAAV-hrGFP was used for packaging the control viral vector AAVGFP. Three days after transfection, cells were harvested, and the recombinant viral vector AAVNPY (or AAVGFP) was purified using the AAV purification kit (Virapur) and concentrated using Centricon YM-100 (Millipore) according to the manufacturers' protocols. Viral titers were determined using quantitative PCR and \u223c1 \u00d7 109 particles/site were used for each viral injection.Twelve 10-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 300\u2013325 g were randomly divided into the two groups. One group of six rats received bilateral DMH injections of AAVNPY, and the other group of six rats received bilateral DMH injections of AAVGFP. Rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/kg) and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus. A volume of 0.3 \u03bcl/site (\u223c1 \u00d7 109 particles/site) of recombinant AAV vectors were bilaterally injected into the DMH with the following coordinates: 3.1 mm caudal to bregma, 0.4 mm lateral to midline, and 8.6 mm ventral to skull surface. Each DMH injection was made with a Hamilton syringe via stepper-motorized nanoliter injection pump (Stoelting) at a rate of 0.05 \u03bcl/min for 6 min and the injection remained in place for additional 5 min before removal. After viral injection, rats continued to have  access to standard rodent chow (a regular chow diet: 15.8% fat, 65.6% carbohydrate, and 18.6% protein in kcal%; 3.37 kcal/g; Prolab RMH 1000; PMI Nutrition International) for 5 weeks. Five weeks later, rats were switched to  access to a high-fat diet (60% fat, 20% carbohydrate, and 20% protein in kcal%; 5.2 kcal/g; D12492; Research Diets) for an additional 6 weeks. Body weights were measured daily and food intake was recorded weekly. Eleven weeks after viral injection, rats were killed between 9:00 A.M. and 11:00 A.M., and brains were removed and rapidly frozen for subsequent examination of hrGFP expression and hypothalamic NPY expression.Four short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) directed to different target sites of  mRNA (shNPY1, base pairs 81\u2013101; shNPY2, base pairs 240\u201360; shNPY3, base pairs 335\u201355; shNPY4, base pairs 270\u201390) (see Fig. 2) based on the rat  mRNA sequence (GenBank NM_012614) were made using the p 1.0-U6 siRNA expression vector (Ambion). A scrambled shRNA (5\u2032-AATGTGTCGGGGTAAGCAAAC-3\u2032) was also made and served as a control (shCTL). For  screen, the shRNA expression plasmid was cotransfected into the AAV 293 cells with the  expression plasmid pAAVNPY at a ratio of 8:1 using Lipofectamine 2000. Seventy-two hours after transfection, total RNA was extracted for determination of  mRNA levels using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. After identification of shNPY2, the insert of DNA containing mouse U6 promoter and shRNA sequence cut from the shNPY2 or control shCTL plasmid was cloned into the pAAV-hrGFP vector (Stratagene). Thus, the two cassettes of CMV promoter driven hrGFP marker and mouse U6 promoter driven shRNA (shNPY or shCTL) were made in the pAAV-hrGFP plasmids (pAAVshNPY or pAAVshCTL), flanked by AAV2 ITR (see Fig. 3). Subsequent viral preparation (AAVshNPY or AAVshCTL) was conducted as described above.Ten male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 275\u2013300 g served as subjects. Rats were randomly divided into the two groups ( = 5 rats per group): one group receiving AAVshNPY and the other group receiving AAVshCTL. Rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/kg) and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus. A volume of 0.3 \u03bcl/site (\u223c1 \u00d7 109 particles/site) of recombinant AAV vectors were bilaterally injected into the ARC with coordinates: 3.1 mm caudal to bregma, 0.4 mm lateral to midline, and 10 mm ventral to skull surface. Each ARC injection was made as described above. Rats were maintained with  access to standard rodent chow and tap water after viral injection. On day 14 after viral injection, we tested the feeding response to food deprivation in the rats. Before food deprivation, 24 h food intake was recorded as a baseline. All rats were food deprived for 24 h but continued  access to water. After 24 h of food deprivation, all rats were refed with standard chow, and 24 h food intake was measured after refeeding. Rats were then allowed to recover for 6 d with  access to food. On day 21 after viral injection, all rats were killed between 9:00 A.M. and 10:00 A.M., and brains were removed rapidly and frozen for subsequent determinations of mRNA expression for  and  using our standard  hybridization technique (Bi et al., 2003).At 4 weeks of age, 12 male OLETF rats weighing 71\u201399 g and six male age-matched LETO rats weighing 81\u201395 g received viral injections. Rats were randomly divided into the three groups: one group of six OLETF rats received bilaterally DMH injections of AAVshNPY (OLETF-AAVshNPY), the second group of six OLETF rats received bilaterally DMH injections of AAVshCTL (OLETF-AAVshCTL), and the third group of six LETO rats received bilaterally DMH injections of AAVshCTL (LETO-AAVshCTL). DMH viral injections were made as described above with the following coordinates: 2.1 mm caudal to bregma, 0.4 mm lateral to midline, and 7.6 mm ventral to skull surface. After viral injection, rats were maintained with  access to standard rodent chow and tap water. Body weights were measured daily and food intake was recorded weekly. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was conducted in rats at 18 weeks of age. At 24 weeks of age, rats were killed between 9:00 A.M. and 11:00 A.M. The left side of epidydimal and inguinal subcutaneous white adipose tissue as well as interscapular brown adipose tissue were harvested and weighed. Trunk blood was taken for evaluating levels of blood glucose and plasma leptin and triglycerides. Blood glucose levels were determined with a FreeStyle glucometer (TheraSense), plasma leptin concentration was determined by a rat leptin radioimmunoassay kit (Linco Research) and plasma triglyceride concentration was determined by a Triglyceride M kit (Wako Chemical). Brains were removed and rapidly frozen for subsequent determinations of hrGFP expression and hypothalamic NPY expression.An additional 12 male OLETF and six age-matched male LETO rats were used for analyses of meal patterns. Bilateral DMH viral injections were made as described above. Six OLETF rats received AAVshNPY injections, the other six OLETF rats received AAVshCTL injections, and six LETO rats received AAVshCTL injections. Two weeks after viral injection, rats were transferred to individual test cages containing computerized feeding devices (MED Associates), which delivered 45 mg chow pellets. Rats had  access to pellets and water. Individual pellets were delivered in response to the removal of the previous pellet. The delivery of each pellet was monitored, time stamped, and stored 24 h/d in a computer. Rats were adapted to the testing apparatus for 7 d. After adaptation, data for 24 h food intake were collected and meal patterns were analyzed using the software (Tongue Twister, version 1.42; Dr. T. A. Houpt, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL). A meal was defined as the acquisition of at least five pellets preceded and followed by at least 20 min of no feeding. Meal size was defined as the number of pellets delivered during a meal (Moran et al., 1998). Five weeks after viral injection, rats were killed, and brains were removed and rapidly frozen for subsequent determination of hypothalamic gene expression as above.After a 16 h overnight fast, rats were administered with glucose at a dose of 2 g/kg by gavage. Tail blood was sampled before and 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 min after giving glucose for the measurements of blood glucose and plasma insulin levels. Blood glucose levels were determined with a FreeStyle glucometer (TheraSense). Plasma insulin concentrations were determined by a rat insulin radioimmunoassay kit (Linco Research).Radioactive  hybridization was conducted as previously described (Bi et al., 2003). Briefly, 35S-labeled antisense riboprobe of  was transcribed from rat  precursor cDNA by using the  transcription system(s) (Promega). Sections ranging from 3.0 to 3.5 mm posterior to bregma (Paxinos and Watson, 2005) were selected, anatomically matched among animals, and used for determination of  mRNA levels in the DMH and the ARC. Sections were treated with acetic anhydride and incubated in our standard hybridization buffer at 55\u00b0C overnight. After hybridization, sections were washed three times with 2\u00d7 SSC, treated with 20 \u03bcg/ml RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min, and then rinsed in 2\u00d7 SSC twice at 55\u00b0C, and washed twice in 0.1\u00d7 SSC at 55\u00b0C for 15 min. Slides were dehydrated in gradient ethanol, air-dried, and exposed with BMR-2 film (Eastman Kodak) for 1\u20133 d. For emulsion autoradiography, slides were dipped in Amersham LM1 emulsion (GE Healthcare Life Sciences), exposed at 4\u00b0C for 10\u201314 d, and developed in Kodak D-19 developer and Kodak fixer (Kodak) according to the manufacturer's protocols.Quantitative analysis of the  hybridization data were done with NIH Scion image software as previously described (Bi et al., 2003). Levels of  mRNA were determined by a mean of the product of hybridization area \u00d7 density (background density was subtracted) in each animal. Data from each group were normalized to the control group as 100%.Fluorescence  hybridization was first conducted for detecting  mRNA as previously described (Bi et al., 2003). Briefly, nonradioactive riboprobe of  was labeled with digoxigenin (DIG)-11-UTP by the  transcription systems (Promega), and applied on brain sections by use of our standard  hybridization procedure. After hybridization and posthybridization washes, DIG-labeled  signals were detected by using a fluorescent antibody enhancer set for DIG Detection kit (Roche) with some modifications. Three kinds of antibodies (mouse IgG anti-DIG and anti-mouse-Ig-DIG each in a final concentration of 1 ng/\u03bcl from Roche and anti-DIG mouse IgG-Cy3 at a 1:1000 dilution from Jackson ImmunoResearch) were sequentially applied to brain sections, and each incubation step was followed by three washes with washing buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol. After  mRNA detection, fluorescent immunohistochemistry was conducted for detecting hrGFP product. Briefly, sections were incubated with rabbit anti-hrGFP antibody (1:1000 dilution; Stratagene) at 4\u00b0C overnight. After three washes, hrGFP signals were stained with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:350 dilution; Invitrogen) at room temperature for 60 min. After final washes, the slides were mounted with the mounting medium and coverslipped, and the sections with dual fluorescent staining of hrGFP (green) and  (red) were examined on a Zeiss Axio Imager (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging).Five male Sprague Dawley rats received unilateral DMH injection of AAVshNPY. Four weeks after viral injection, rats were anesthetized with Euthasol and perfused transcardially with PBS, pH 7.4, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains were removed and placed in 25% sucrose\u20134% paraformaldehyde overnight. NPY immunostaining was conducted as previously described (Bi et al., 2004). Briefly, 14 \u03bcm coronal sections at the level(s) of the brainstem dorsal vagal complex (DVC) were prepared and incubated with anti-NPY monoclonal antibody (a gift from Dr. Eric Grouzmann, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, Lausanne, Switzerland). After three wishes, sections were incubated with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (at 1:400 dilutions; Jackson ImmunoResearch) at room temperature for 1 h. After final washes, the slides were mounted with the mounting medium and coverslipped, and the sections with NPY (red) fluorescence were examined on a Zeiss Axio Imager (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging).An additional 10 male Sprague Dawley rats were used for determination of NPY protein levels in the DVC of AAVshNPY-injected rats. One group of five rats received bilateral DMH injections of AAVshNPY, and the other group of five rats received bilateral DMH injections of AAVshCTL. Four weeks after viral injection, rats were killed, and the tissues at levels of the DMH, the ARC, and the DVC were punched out, the samples from both sides of the DMH, the ARC, and one side of the DVC were used for  mRNA determinations by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, and the samples from the other side of the DVC were used for NPY protein determinations by Western blot analysis.Twenty male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into the two groups. One group of 10 rats received bilateral DMH injections of AAVshNPY, and the other group of 10 rats received bilateral DMH injections of AAVshCTL. Three weeks after viral injection, rats were transferred to individual test cages for meal pattern analysis as described above. After this analysis, rats were returned to home cages to study feeding response to peripheral administration of cholecystokinin (CCK). As previously described (Chen et al., 2007), rats were fed in a feeding schedule in which pelleted chow was removed from the cages 2 h before lights off and returned to the cages just before dark onset. After habituation(s), one-half of AAVshNPY and AAVshCTL rats received CCK-8 (3.2 nmol/kg, i.p.) and the other one-half of the rats received 0.9% saline (intraperitoneally) just before lights off. Pelleted chow was returned to the cages immediately after injections. Thirty minute food intake was measured. After 2 d recovery, all rats were given a second injection with saline or CCK-8 (3.2 nmol/kg, i.p.) in counterbalanced order. Food intake was measured as after the first injections.After feeding tests, c-Fos immunohistochemistry was conducted. Rats were randomly divided into four groups. One-half of AAVshNPY and AAVshCTL rats received CCK-8 (3.2 nmol/kg, i.p.) and the other one-half of the rats received 0.9% saline (intraperitoneally), but the rats were not allowed to access to chow after injection. Ninety minutes after injection, the rats were anesthetized with Euthasol and perfused transcardially with PBS, pH 7.4, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains were removed and placed in 25% sucrose\u20134% paraformaldehyde overnight. Forty micrometer coronal sections were cut on a cryostat at the level through the rostrocaudal extent of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). Sections were incubated with c-Fos antibody as previously described (Chen et al., 2007). After staining, sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides and coverslipped. Images of sections were captured by digital camera attached to Zeiss Axio Imager (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging). c-Fos-positive cells were automatically counted by the IPLab imaging system (BD Biosciences Bioimaging) by setting minimum and maximum optical density levels. Counts were made at three rostrocaudal levels of the NTS at the following distances (in millimeters) caudal to bregma (Paxinos and Watson, 2005): rostral NTS (\u221213.44); medial NTS at the area postrema (AP) (\u221213.8); caudal NTS (\u221214.28); and one level of the AP (\u221213.8); Data for c-Fos activation are presented as the total number of c-Fos-positive cells per section.Total RNA was extracted from each sample by using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Conventional real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was conducted for determinations of mRNA levels by using the iScript one-step RT-PCR kit with SYBR Green (Bio-Rad Laboratories) on iQ5 Multicolor Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories). \u03b2-Actin was used as an internal control for quantification of individual mRNA. The list of primer sets was as follows: NPY, forward primer, 5\u2032-agagatccagccctgagaca-3\u2032, and reverse primer, 5\u2032-aacgacaacaagggaaatgg-3\u2032; \u03b2-actin, forward primer, 5\u2032-tgtcaccaactgggacgata-3\u2032, and reverse primer, 5\u2032-ggatggctacgtacatggct-3\u2032; CCK1 receptors, forward primer, 5\u2032-gcggacggtcaccaacatcttc-3\u2032, and reverse primer, 5\u2032-cggaagtgcccatgaagtaggtg-3\u2032; and hrGFP, forward primer, 5\u2032-ccccgaggacatcagcgactt-3\u2032, and reverse primer, 5\u2032-cgcggtacacgaacatctcctc-3\u2032.Twenty micrograms of cell lysate protein or DVC protein lysate was separated by using 12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then incubated with rabbit anti-NPY antibody (1:1000 dilutions; DiaSorin), followed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit antibody (1:5000 dilutions; GE Healthcare) and detected by ECL Western blotting detection reagents and analysis system (GE Healthcare).Data were analyzed using the commercial software (SigmaStat, version 3.10). Data for body weight gain and food intake were analyzed using two-way repeated-measures ANOVA, and data for  mRNA expression were analyzed using Student's  test in the experiment of AAV-mediated NPY overexpression. Data for food intake were analyzed using two-way ANOVA and data for  and  mRNA expression in the ARC were analyzed using Student's  test in the experiment of AAV-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) in the ARC of Sprague Dawley rats. Data for body weight gain, food intake, meal patterns, and levels of blood glucose and plasma insulin, leptin, and triglyceride as well as  mRNA expression were analyzed using one-way ANOVA in the experiment of AAV-mediated RNAi in the DMH of OLETF rats. Data for food intake and c-Fos activation in response to peripheral administration of CCK were analyzed using two-way ANOVA. All ANOVAs were followed by pairwise multiple Fisher's least significant difference comparisons. A value of  < 0.05 was considered to be a statistically significant difference.AAV serotype 2 has widely been used as a means of brain gene delivery with features of safety, neuronal- and injection site-specific infection, and maintaining gene expression for long periods (Okada et al., 2002; Passini et al., 2004). Using this viral vector, we generated a recombinant vector of AAV-mediated expression of NPY (AAVNPY). As shown in Figure 1, the vector AAVNPY contains the  gene driven by the CMV promoter and the hrGFP marker gene translationally controlled by the IRES, and the vector is flanked by AAV2 ITR. After viral preparation, we determined the ability of AAVNPY to produce NPY in cultured AAV-293 cells infected with viral vectors. We validated that hrGFP was expressed in AAVNPY-infected cells by fluorescent microscopy (Fig. 1) and NPY protein was produced by AAVNPY as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1).Effects of AAV-mediated overexpression of NPY in the DMH on food intake and body weight in lean rats. , Construct of AAV-mediated  expression vector (AAVNPY) containing the  gene driven by the CMV promoter and the expression marker of hrGFP translationally controlled by the IRES, flanked by AAV2 ITRs. , Representative micrograph shows hrGFP expression in AAVNPY-infected AAV293 cells as examined under fluorescence microscopy. , Western blot detected NPY product in AAVNPY-infected AAV293 cells.

We verified that viral vectors successfully infected the cells within and around the compact subregion of the DMH (Fig. 1, hrGFP-positive cells; ,  mRNA expression) and that this infection did not occur in other hypothalamic areas (Fig. 1). As shown in Figure 1, hrGFP expression was strongly detected in the DMH as early as 2 weeks after viral injection. Consistent with the feature of maintaining gene expression for long periods, determination of mRNA levels by  hybridization confirmed that AAVNPY produced a 2.3-fold increase in  expression in the DMH relative to control levels at 11 weeks after viral injection. Importantly, NPY expression in the ARC was not affected (Fig. 1).We examined body weight gain in AAVNPY- and AAVGFP-injected rats. We found that the AAVNPY rats started to gain significantly more weight than the AAVGFP rats at 4 weeks after viral injection such that they gained 14 and 20% more weight compared with AAVGFP rats at 4 ( = 0.011) and 5 weeks ( < 0.001), respectively (Fig. 1). The effects of DMH AAVNPY injections were long-lasting. We found that AAVNPY rats had sustained increases in body weight and gained 16% more than AAVGFP rats over 16 weeks after viral injection (510 \u00b1 13 g in AAVNPY vs 441 \u00b1 19 g in AAVGFP;  = 5;  = 0.017). To see whether NPY overexpression in the DMH altered susceptibility to high-fat diet-induced obesity, we switched rats from the regular chow to the high-fat diet 5 weeks after viral injection (Fig. 1). Six weeks of access to a high-fat diet resulted in significant increases in weight gain in both AAVNPY and AAVGFP rats ( < 0.001), but the rate of weight gain in the AAVNPY rats was significantly greater ( < 0.001) (Fig. 1). Overall, AAVNPY rats gained 34% more weight than AAVGFP rats by the end of 6 weeks of access to a high-fat diet (Fig. 1).An analysis of the food intake data revealed that AAVNPY rats ate significantly more regular chow than AAVGFP rats during weeks 4 ( = 0.016) and 5 ( = 0.011) after viral injection (Fig. 1). The increase in weight gain discussed above coincided with this increase in food intake. Access to a high-fat diet resulted in increased food intake in both groups of rats, but NPY overexpression in the DMH resulted in a significantly greater increase in daily caloric intake during weeks 7, 9, 10, and 11 after viral injection, leading to overall increases in cumulative intake of AVVNPY rats from 9% on a regular chow diet to 48% on a high-fat diet relative to a basal level of AAVGFP rats, whereas the cumulative intake of AAVGFP rats increased only by 27% on a high-fat diet from their basal levels (Fig. 1).We used the technique of RNAi (Fire et al., 1998) to directly determine the function of DMH NPY. We first screened a series of -specific shRNAs (Fig. 2, shNPY1\u20134) for their efficacy in knocking down  gene expression  using the p 1.0-U6 siRNA expression vector. We identified that shNPY2 produced a robust knockdown effect on  mRNA expression relative to a control shCTL (Fig. 2). We further examined the knockdown effects of shNPY2 in a dose-related manner by cotransfecting the plasmids shNPY2 and pAAVNPY at a range of ratios from 2:1 to 8:1 into AAV-293 cells. Seventy-two hours after transfection, we lysed cells and examined levels of  mRNA and protein using real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. We found that shNPY2 produced a dose-related inhibition of  mRNA expression (Fig. 2) and NPY protein product (Fig. 2). To determine whether this knockdown effect was gene specific, we examined the effects of shNPY2 on mRNA expression of CCK1 receptors in an  study. We cotransfected the plasmid shNPY2 (or shCTL) into AAV 293 cells with the CCK1 receptor expression plasmid at a ratio of 8:1 using Lipofectamine 2000. Seventy-two hours after transfection, total RNA was extracted and CCK1 receptor expression was determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. We found that CCK1 receptor mRNA levels did not differ between the shNPY2 and shCTL groups (100 \u00b1 9.1 in shCTL-transfected cells vs 97 \u00b1 14.8 in shNPY2-transfected cells;  > 0.05), indicating that the knockdown effect of shNPY2 was gene specific.Screen of shRNAs for knocking down NPY expression (shNPY). , Four shRNAs directed to four different target sites of  mRNA (shNPY1\u20134) were made using the p 1.0-U6 siRNA expression vector. ,  screen of shNPYs by cotransfecting shNPY expression plasmids (shCTL as a control) and NPY expression plasmids (pAAVNPY) at a ratio of 8:1 into the AAV 293 cells by use of Lipofectamine 2000.

Error bars indicate SEM.We next generated a recombinant vector of AAV-mediated RNAi with shNPY2 (AAVshNPY) for  study. As shown in Figure 3, the vector AAVshNPY contains mouse U6 promoter-driven shNPY (or shCTL for AAVshCTL) and CMV promoter-driven hrGFP marker. Because it has been well known that ARC NPY mediates the feeding response to food deprivation (Spiegelman and Flier, 2001; Schwartz and Porte, 2005), we tested AAVshNPY-mediated RNAi  by injecting AAVshNPY or AAVshCTL bilaterally into the ARC of adult Sprague Dawley rats. We found that ARC injection of AAVshNPY (Fig. 3, hrGFP-positive cells) significantly inhibited  mRNA expression in the ARC (Fig. 3,,) with the result that the feeding response to 24 h food deprivation was significantly reduced (Fig. 3). Moreover, we determined NPY-specific knockdown effects of RNAi. Although NPY and agouti-related protein (AgRP) are colocalized in the ARC neurons (Broberger et al., 1998; Hahn et al., 1998), levels of  mRNA expression in the ARC did not significantly differ between AAVshNPY and AAVshCTL rats (Fig. 3). Thus, we successfully documented that AAVshNPY is capable of producing RNAi  to specifically knock down  mRNA expression and inhibit NPY function.Bilateral injections of AAVshNPY into the ARC altered ARC NPY functions. , Construct of AAV-mediated RNAi vector (AAVshNPY or AAVshCTL) containing CMV promoter-driven hrGFP marker and mouse U6 promoter (mU6)-driven shRNA (shNPY or shCTL). , Representative micrograph shows viral-infected neurons in the ARC as examined by hrGFP expression. , Injection of AAVshNPY into the ARC bilaterally decreased feeding response to 24 h food deprivation.

We have suggested that NPY overexpression in the DMH contributes to the hyperphagia and obesity of OLETF rats (Bi et al., 2001). To further identify the role of DMH NPY in energy balance, we examined the effects of knockdown of DMH NPY expression on hyperphagia and obesity in OLETF rats. After DMH viral injections, we examined hrGFP and NPY expression in the DMH. As expected, viral vectors infected the neurons within the DMH (Fig. 4, hrGFP-positive neurons), and AAVshNPY injection significantly knocked down DMH  mRNA expression (Fig. 4,). Dual labeling of hrGFP and NPY revealed that  expression was strongly detected in the DMH neurons that were infected by AAVshCTL in both LETO-AAVshCTL and OLETF-AAVshCTL rats, whereas  expression was greatly suppressed in AAVshNPY-infected neurons in OLETF-AAVshNPY rats (Fig. 4). Determination of mRNA expression by  hybridization confirmed that  was expressed in the compact subregion of the DMH in LETO-AAVshCTL and OLETF-AAVshCTL rats, but  expression at this site was greatly suppressed in OLETF-AAVshNPY rats (Fig. 4). AAVshNPY injection produced a 42 and 45% suppression of  mRNA expression in the DMH of OLETF-AAVshNPY rats relative to OLETF-AAVshCTL rats at 5 (Fig. 4) and 20 weeks after viral injection (Fig. 4), respectively. This knockdown effect was site specific. NPY expression in the ARC did not differ between OLETF-AAVshNPY and OLETF-AAVshCTL rats, and both groups of rats had similarly reduced ARC  mRNA expression compared with LETO rats (Fig. 4). Such a reduction of ARC NPY expression in OLETF rats is consistent with our previous results and likely attributable to their increased leptin levels (Bi et al., 2001).AAV-mediated knockdown of NPY expression in the DMH. , Representative micrograph shows hrGFP expression in the DMH after viral DMH injection as examined under fluorescence microscopy. , Representative micrograph shows  expression (red) in AAVshCTL-infected (hrGFP; green) neurons (orange) in LETO-AAVshCTL and OLETF-AAVshCTL rats, but not in AAVshNPY-infected (green) neurons in OLETF-AAVshNPY rats, as determined by dual fluorescent  hybridization for  and immunohistochemistry for GFP.

As a result, the rate of weight gain did not differ between OLETF-AAVshNPY and LETO-AAVshCTL rats out until 11 weeks of age (Fig. 5). The effects of AAVshNPY injection were long lasting. At 24 weeks of age, OLETF-AAVshCTL rats gained 48% more weight than LETO-AAVshCTL rats, whereas the weight gain of OLETF-AAVshNPY rats was only 17% higher than that of LETO-AAVshCTL rats (Fig. 5).Effects of DMH NPY knockdown on food intake and body weight in OLETF rats. , Mean \u00b1 SEM body weight gain in LETO-AAVshCTL, OLETF-AAVshCTL, and OLETF-AAVshNPY rats.  = 6 rats per group.

Values are means \u00b1 SEM.  = 6 rats per group. * < 0.05 compared with LETO-AAVshCTL rats; # < 0.05 compared with OLETF-AAVshCTL rats.Knockdown of NPY expression in the DMH also significantly decreased the hyperphagia of OLETF rats. OLETF-AAVshCTL rats consumed 42% more food than LETO-AAVshCTL rats over the experimental period ( < 0.001) (Fig. 5). This increased intake was significantly reduced by knockdown of DMH NPY expression. OLETF-AAVshNPY rats ate significantly less food than did OLETF-AAVshCTL rats ( = 0.005) (Fig. 5). Although OLETF-AAVshNPY rats consumed 16% more cumulative food than LETO-AAVshCTL rats, this difference did not reach statistical significance ( = 0.063) (Fig. 5).We analyzed patterns of 24 h food intake using a feeding monitoring system and found that knockdown of DMH NPY expression produced a nocturnal- and meal size-specific feeding effect. Although OLETF-AAVshCTL rats consumed significantly more food than LETO-AAVshCTL rats during both dark and light periods, the increased intake during the dark period was completely normalized in OLETF-AAVshNPY rats (Fig. 5). OLETF-AAVshNPY rats increased food intake during the light period compared with OLETF-AAVshCTL rats (Fig. 5), but this increase was not sufficient to compensate for the decrease in food intake during the dark period. Overall, although the daily intake was greatly increased in OLETF-AAVshCTL rats, the total intake of OLETF-AAVshNPY rats was not significantly different from that of LETO-AAVshCTL rats ( = 0.093) (Fig. 5). Meal pattern analysis revealed that, although meal size was significantly increased in OLETF-AAVshCTL rats compared with LETO-AAVshCTL rats overall and during both dark and light periods, knockdown of DMH NPY expression significantly decreased the total increased meal size by specifically decreasing meal size during the dark period (Fig. 5). Knockdown of DMH NPY expression did not affect total meal number or the number of meals during the dark period but did result in increased meal number during the light period (Fig. 5).At 18 weeks of age, OLETF rats develop hyperglycemia and diabetes (Kawano et al., 1992). To determine whether these alterations were affected by knockdown of DMH  expression, we performed an oral glucose tolerance test in rats at 18 weeks of age. Consistent with previous results (Kawano et al., 1992), OLETF-AAVshCTL rats were hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic and became glucose intolerant and insulin insensitive (Fig. 6,), indicating that OLETF-AAVshCTL rats had altered glucose homeostasis and developed diabetes. Knockdown of DMH NPY expression and the resulting decreases in food intake and body weight resulted in significant ameliorations of these alterations (Fig. 6,). Again, these effects were long lasting. At 24 weeks of age, nonfasting glucose levels in OLETF-AAVshCTL rats were much higher than those of LETO-AAVshCTL rats (205 \u00b1 24 mg/dl in OLETF-AAVshCTL vs 117 \u00b1 6 mg/dl in LETO-AAVshCTL rats;  < 0.001), whereas this hyperglycemia was significantly lowered in OLETF-AAVshNPY rats (137 \u00b1 7 mg/dl), down to levels similar to those of LETO-AAVshCTL rats ( = 0.366).Effects of DMH NPY knockdown on levels of blood glucose and plasma insulin and leptin as well as fat mass in OLETF rats. , Blood glucose response to oral glucose administration. , Plasma insulin response to oral glucose administration. , Fat weights at three different sites in the three groups of rats. , Plasma leptin levels in the three groups of rats. Values are means \u00b1 SEM.  = 6 rats per group. * < 0.05 compared with LETO-AAVshCTL rats; # < 0.05 compared with OLETF-AAVshCTL rats.Increased body fat and plasma leptin levels are features of obesity in OLETF rats (Bi et al., 2001). We next determined the effects of knockdown of DMH NPY expression and the resulting decreases in food intake and body weight on fat mass and plasma leptin levels at killing. We measured the epididymal and subcutaneous white fat as well as the interscapular brown fat and found that knockdown of DMH NPY expression significantly attenuated these increased fat accumulation that characterizes OLETF rats (Fig. 6). Consistent with changes in body fat mass, plasma leptin levels were significantly elevated in OLETF-AAVshCTL rats, whereas this elevation was significantly reduced in OLETF-AAVshNPY rats (Fig. 6).Stafford et al. (2008) have recently reported that central NPY signaling modulates very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride secretion. We examined plasma triglyceride levels in OLETF rats at killing. We found that OLETF-AAVshCTL rats had significantly increased levels of plasma triglycerides (202 \u00b1 13 mg/dl) compared with LETO-AAVshCTL rats (94 \u00b1 5 mg/dl;  < 0.001). This elevation was significantly lowered in OLETF-AAVshNPY rats (133 \u00b1 17 mg/dl;  =0.014 compared with OLETF-AAVshCTL rats), reaching normal levels as seen in LETO-AAVshCTL rats ( = 0.144).The finding that knockdown of NPY expression in the DMH has a specific effect on meal size (Fig. 5) suggests an interaction of DMH NPY projections with systems that mediate within-meal feedback signaling. Because the brainstem DVC is the site of reception of gastrointestinal satiation signals (such as CCK) that control the size of individual meals (Moran, 2004), we next determined whether DMH NPY modulates within-meal satiation signaling through actions at brainstem sites. We first examined whether NPY neurons in the DMH project to the brainstem by injecting AAVshNPY into the DMH and examining NPY fiber immunostaining with anti-NPY antibody in the brainstem. We found that unilateral injection of AAVshNPY strongly infected neurons within the injected DMH (Fig. 7, hrGFP-positive neurons) and suppressed  mRNA expression in the ipsilateral DMH (Fig. 7). Again, this knockdown effect was confined within the site of DMH injection without affecting  mRNA expression in either the ARC or DVC as determined by real time RT-PCR (Fig. 7). Immunohistochemistry revealed that the unilateral DMH injection of AAVshNPY significantly decreased NPY fiber (red) staining in the ipsilateral regions of the NTS and the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus (DMV), particularly in the medial and intermediate parts of the NTS and the lateral part of the DMV, compared with the contralateral areas (Fig. 7). Overall, AAVshNPY injection resulted in a 45% reduction in NPY protein levels in the DVC as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 7). Thus, NPY neurons in the DMH project to the NTS/DMV, and suppression of  mRNA expression in the DMH reduces NPY protein levels at these projection sites, raising the possibility that alterations in feeding in response to changes in DMH NPY expression are mediated through alterations in NPY signaling at this brainstem site. To test this possibility, we examined the feeding response to peripheral administration of CCK in intact rats receiving bilateral DMH injections of AAVshNPY. As we had seen in OLETF rats, knockdown of NPY expression in the DMH of intact rats significantly decreased meal size during the dark period (from 65 \u00b1 5.9 to 49 \u00b1 3.7 45 mg pellets;  = 6;  = 0.044). We tested the feeding inhibitory effects of peripheral CCK administration in AAVshNPY rats and AAVshCTL rats of comparable body weight (526 \u00b1 11 g in AAVshNPY rats and 527 \u00b1 18 g in AAVshCTL rats;  > 0.05). We found that peripheral administration of CCK produced a greater feeding inhibition in AAVshNPY rats than in AAVshCTL rats (Fig. 8). Consistent with these feeding data, c-Fos-like immunohistochemistry revealed that peripheral CCK administration produced significantly more c-Fos activation in the NTS and the AP of AAVshNPY rats compared with AAVshCTL rats (Fig. 8,).Knockdown of DMH NPY expression alters NPY signaling to the brainstem. , Unilateral injection of AAVshNPY into the DMH (hrGFP-positive neurons) () suppressed ipsilateral  expression () and resulted in decreased NPY fiber (red) staining in the ipsilateral site of the NTS and the DMV (). ,  gene expression was specifically suppressed in the DMH but not in the ARC and the DVC in rats receiving DMH AAVshNPY injections (AAVshNPY) relative to control rats receiving AAVshCTL injections (AAVshCTL) as determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR.  = 5 rats per group. * < 0.05 compared with AAVshCTL rats. , NPY protein levels were decreased in the DVC of AAVshNPY rats compared with AAVshCTL rats ( = 5 rats per group; * < 0.05) as determined by Western blot.DMH NPY modulates satiation actions of peripheral CCK. , Knockdown of DMH NPY expression enhanced CCK-induced feeding inhibition.

We found that AAV-mediated NPY overexpression in the DMH of lean rats increased food intake and body weight, and exacerbated high-fat diet-induced obesity. Knockdown of NPY expression in the DMH via AAV-mediated RNAi ameliorated the hyperphagia, obesity, and diabetes of OLETF rats. DMH NPY knockdown produced a nocturnal- and meal size-specific feeding effect. Moreover, we found that DMH NPY knockdown in intact rats reduced NPY signaling in the NTS/DMV to affect within-meal satiation. DMH NPY knockdown increased the feeding inhibitory and NTS c-Fos responses to peripheral administration of CCK. Together, these results indicate that DMH NPY plays an important role in modulating food intake and energy balance.We first generated a vector of AAV-mediated NPY expression to investigate the consequences of NPY overexpression in the DMH of intact rats. We found that AAV-mediated NPY overexpression in the DMH resulted in increased food intake and body weight. Consistent with the proposed role for DMH NPY overexpression in exaggerating the hyperphagia and obesity in OLETF rats on a high-fat diet (Bi et al., 2007), AAV-mediated NPY overexpression in the DMH resulted in an exacerbation of high-fat diet-induced hyperphagia and obesity. Although this experiment did not examine the aspect of energy expenditure, it appears that the increases in food intake were sufficient to account for the increased body weight changes in AAVNPY rats on both chow and high-fat diets. Their increased food intake would predict 31 and 87 g greater weight changes on chow and high fat diet, respectively, amounts not significantly different from the actual increased weight gains. Nevertheless, because neurons in the DMH have been shown to play a role in thermoregulation (Dimicco and Zaretsky, 2007), direct effects of alterations in DMH NPY expression on energy expenditure are worth investigating.We next examined the actions of DMH NPY in energy balance by bilaterally injecting AAVshNPY into the DMH of OLETF rats and examining whether DMH NPY knockdown prevents their hyperphagia, obesity, and diabetes. We found that AAV-mediated knockdown of DMH NPY expression significantly decreased food intake, body weight, and body fat of OLETF rats. The effects on food intake were specific to the documented increases in meal size in this model (Moran et al., 1998). Although OLETF-AAVshNPY rats increased weight gain at later times as likely some form of compensation, this increase was small so that they maintained significantly lower body weight. Moreover, DMH NPY knockdown ameliorated the hyperglycemia and hyperleptinemia and restored insulin sensitivity in OLETF rats. Because caloric restriction lowers body weight as well as prevents hyperglycemia, hyperleptinemia, and hyperinsulinemia in OLETF rats (Okauchi et al., 1995; Bi et al., 2001), these ameliorations resulting from DMH NPY knockdown are likely a consequence of their reduced body weight. Furthermore, although OLETF rats developed hypertriglycerides, DMH NPY knockdown reduced this elevation, implying one possibility that DMH NPY might be involved in VLDL triglyceride secretion (Stafford et al., 2008). Nevertheless, our results provide strong evidence demonstrating that DMH NPY overexpression plays a major role in the hyperphagia, obesity, and diabetes of OLETF rats, and also identify the physiological functions of DMH NPY in the regulation of energy balance.NPY expression is differentially regulated in the ARC and the DMH. Whereas ARC  mRNA expression is increased in response to both acute food deprivation and chronic food restriction, DMH  expression is only increased in response to chronic food restriction (Bi et al., 2003). Although obese rodents have increased  expression in the DMH, their ARC  expression is unchanged or even decreased (Kesterson et al., 1997; Guan et al., 1998a,b; Tritos et al., 1998; Bi et al., 2001). The control of NPY signaling also differs between the ARC and the DMH. Whereas ARC NPY signaling is under the control of leptin (Schwartz and Porte, 2005), a hormone that is produced in adipocytes and acts as a feedback signal to the hypothalamus regarding body energy stores (Friedman and Halaas, 1998), DMH NPY signaling appears to be independent of leptin. DHM NPY neurons do not express leptin receptors (Bi et al., 2003) but do contain CCK1 receptors (Bi et al., 2004). DMH NPY has been suggested to mediate the feeding actions of central CCK (Chen et al., 2007) and those of other peptides including melanocortins (Chen et al., 2004), galanin-like peptide (Kuramochi et al., 2006), and unknown molecules (Bi et al., 2005). Although ARC NPY mediates the feeding actions of ghrelin (Nakazato et al., 2001), a relationship between ghrelin and DMH NPY signaling has yet to be determined. The downstream consequences of DMH NPY signaling are also different from that of ARC NPY. ARC NPY neurons primarily project to the PVN and LH and innervate local neurons to affect energy balance (Elmquist et al., 1999). Bugarith et al. (2005) reported that lesions of basomedial hypothalamic NPY receptor-expressing neurons (including ARC NPY neurons) by NPY conjugated to saporin affected daytime but not nighttime food intake. Such lesions did not alter the feeding response to peripheral administration of CCK (Bugarith et al., 2005). In contrast, the current studies revealed that AAV-mediated knockdown of DMH NPY expression produced a nocturnal-specific feeding effect. This knockdown resulted in decreased NPY signaling to the NTS/DMV, leading to decreased meal size and increased feeding inhibitory response to peripheral administration of CCK. Thus, these data identified a physiological function of DMH NPY in feeding control [i.e., DMH NPY normally affects food intake through specifically affecting meal size by modulating within-meal satiation signal (such as CCK) in the brainstem]. Such data also provide a basis for the interpretation of the findings that DMH lesions that damage DHM NPY neurons result in hypophagia characterized by a specific reduction in meal size (Bellinger et al., 1986).A role for the DMH in food-entrainable circadian behavior has been suggested from previous studies. Although there is some controversy over the effect of DMH lesions on food anticipatory activity (Gooley et al., 2006; Landry et al., 2006), Mieda et al. (2006) have demonstrated a robust oscillation of  and  expression in the compact subregion of the DMH only under restricted feeding. Combined with our previous findings that food restriction elevates  expression in this area (Bi et al., 2003), data from the current findings of the nocturnal feeding effects of DMH NPY imply that DMH NPY may also serve as an important regulator of circadian feeding. Such actions merit additional investigation.Consistent with the reported actions of RNAi, our  and  experiments demonstrated that shNPY produced a robust and selective suppression of NPY expression. Because the shRNA could produce off-target effects, we have attempted to control for such possibilities in multiple ways. We have used scrambled shRNA for our control injections so that effects of the targeted manipulations can be differentiated from those of viral infections. In a number of the  and  manipulations, we have measured the expression of other genes and shown that they were unaffected. For instance,  shNPY produced a dose-related suppression on  mRNA expression and protein levels, but did not affect CCK1 receptor gene expression compared with shCTL. Bilateral injection of AAVshNPY into the ARC of adult rats significantly decreased ARC  gene expression without affecting  expression. Moreover, we have shown that the expression of ARC NPY is not affected by knockdown of DMH NPY, documenting the site-specific nature of the manipulation. Despite these controls, there is always the possibility that some aspects of the results are not directly attributable to changes in DMH NPY expression.A final issue is how the present results should be interpreted in the context of multiple experiments in mice aimed at targeting NPY [either knock-out (Erickson et al., 1996) or transcriptional alterations through doxycycline-regulated system (Ste Marie et al., 2005)] that have failed to demonstrate significant effects on food intake or body weight. There are multiple possibilities. One possibility is a species difference. In support of this view, we have previously shown that  gene is expressed in the DMH of rats, but its expression is undetectable in mice (Bi et al., 2004). Another possibility is that the mode of alteration in NPY expression makes a difference. Viral-mediated NPY alterations appear to produce long-lasting effects. Both AAV-mediated expression of antisense NPY in the ARC (Gardiner et al., 2005) and AAV-mediated ectopic overexpression of NPY in the LH (Tiesjema et al., 2007) altered body weight gain over 50 d. Such data are consistent with our results demonstrating AAV-mediated alterations in DMH NPY expression and the resulting changes in food intake and body weight that last for up to 16 weeks in NPY overexpression rats and 20 weeks in NPY knockdown rats. Thus, our present results not only demonstrate the role of DMH NPY in modulating food intake and energy balance in rats, but also provide additional evidence showing the utility of AAV-mediated gene modulation for studying the site-specific gene functions.This work was supported by National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Grants DK074269 (S.B.) and DK057609 (T.H.M.).Thank you for sharing this Journal of Neuroscience article.NOTE: We request your email address only to inform the recipient that it was you who recommended this article, and that it is not junk mail.
