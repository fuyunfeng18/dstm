{"s12864-019-5528-1": "Identifying mRNA targets of miRNAs is critical for studying gene expression regulation at the whole-genome level. Multiple computational tools have been developed to predict miRNA:mRNA interactions. Nonetheless, many of these tools are developed in various small datasets, which each represent a limited sample space. Thus, the prediction accuracy of these tools has not been systematically validated at a larger scale. Accordingly, comparing the prediction accuracy of these tools and determining their applicability become challenging. In addition, the accuracy of these tools, especially in large datasets, needs to be improved for broader applications.In this project, a large dataset containing more than 46,600 miRNA:mRNA interactions was assembled and split into eleven subsets based on the availability of prediction scores of four individual predictors, which are miRanda, miRDB, PITA, and TargetScan. In each of these subsets, the predictive results of four individual predictors were integrated using decision-tree based artificial neural networks to make the meta-prediction. The decision-tree is used here to sort the predictive results of four individual predictors, and artificial neural networks are applied to make meta-prediction based on the outputs of individual predictors. In the decision tree, dual-threshold and two-step significance-voting were incorporated, information gain was analysed to select threshold values. The prediction performance of this new strategy was improved significantly in most of the eleven datasets comparing to the individual predictors and other meta-predictors, such as ComiR, under multi-fold cross-validation, as well as in independent datasets. The overall improvement of prediction accuracy in independent datasets is at least 9 percentile points comparing to the other predictors, and the percentage of improvement of F1 and MCC scores is at least 40% compared to the other predictors.The combination of dual-threshold, two-step significance-voting, and analysis of information gain is very effective in optimizing the outcome of decision-tree, and further integration with artificial neural networks is critical for further improving the performance of meta-predictor. A new pipeline based on this integration for miRNA target prediction has been developed. A strategy using outputs of individual predictors to reorganize large-scale miRNA:mRNA interaction dataset has also been validated and used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of predictors. The predictor is available at: https://github.com/xueLab/mirTarDANN).MiRNAs are short RNA molecules of about 22 nucleotides [1], which are normally produced from non-coding RNAs by a process of two-step cleavage catalyzed by Drosha [2] and Dicer [3, 4], respectively. Although being very short compared to many other types of RNA molecules, miRNAs play critical roles in genome-wide gene expression regulation. Most miRNAs perform their functions through the well-known canonical pathway [5\u20137], in which an miRNA forms base pairing with the 3\u2032-UTRs of its target mRNAs [8] to repress the expression of those mRNAs by either inhibiting translation or inducing mRNA degradation [5, 9]. Since the discovery of the first miRNA lin-4 in the 1990s [10], more and more miRNAs have been identified. Many mammal genomes each contain more than 2000 miRNAs [11]. These miRNAs were estimated to regulate about 60% of all genes in each genome [12\u201314].Clearly, identifying the targets of miRNAs is critical for deciphering the functions of miRNAs, as well as revealing the mechanisms of gene expression regulation. For this purpose, many computational tools have been developed to predict the interaction partners of miRNAs [12, 15\u201330]. These tools are generally developed based on two categories of strategies: (I) base pairing between the seed region of miRNA and the 3\u2032-UTR of mRNA, in integration with various sequential, structural, interaction, and evolutionary information [12, 22\u201326]; (II) machine learning based methods, such as hidden Markov Model (HMM) [16], support vector machine (SVM) [27, 28], and regression models [29]. With the application of these advanced techniques, significant progress has been achieved in the development of miRNA target predictors. Nonetheless, these predictors start to face many other challenges nowadays. Many predictors were trained and tested in rather small datasets when the predictors were developed. However, the amount of genomics/proteomics data is increasing very fast. Consequently, the accuracy of existing computational tools on newly emerged large-scale datasets becomes a question. In addition, the prediction accuracy of many existing miRNA target predictors is still not sufficient for direct applications [31]. Especially, the sensitivity of many existing predictors is rather low. Furthermore, when using machine learning based techniques to build a predictor, the common procedure is to build a dataset, select features, and then optimize the predictor. Clearly, when the dataset or the number of features used in the predictor becomes larger, the intrinsic noise associated with the dataset or the features will increase and may eventually impede the optimization of new predictors in large datasets. Therefore, it is also critical to develop new strategies to improve the prediction performance of predictors in large datasets.In our previous studies on the development of various predictors [32\u201336], as well as the studies of other groups [30, 37, 38], individual predictors were integrated to make meta-prediction to improve the final prediction accuracy. However, a direct integration of the outputs of individual predictors may not improve the prediction accuracy significantly [32\u201334]. Under this situation, further integration of other techniques, such as non-linear transformation [34, 39] and dual-threshold value [35, 36], was very effective in improving prediction accuracy. In addition to using meta-strategy, splitting a large dataset into multiple smaller datasets is an alternative strategy for developing dataset-specific predictors and for combining dataset-specific predictors to improve the final prediction accuracy [35, 36]. In our previous work, dual-threshold and sequential voting were used to make meta-prediction for miRNA:mRNA interactions [35]. Nonetheless, the sample size is still insufficient, and the meta-predictor only integrates three individual predictors, including: miRanda, miRDB, and PITA [35]. Besides, it is also clear to us that dual-threshold sequential-voting has profound dependence on threshold values. Stringent threshold values will result in high-confidence predictions, but less number of true predictions. On the other hand, less-stringent threshold values will lead to a higher number of true predictions, but also low-confidence. Consequently, it is challenging to keep balance between confidence and number of true predictions, and therefore the effectiveness of dual-threshold sequential-voting is still limited. To solve these problems, we designed an upgraded strategy in this project focusing on the following aspects: (1) increasing sample size; (2) changing dual-threshold sequential-voting to dual-threshold two-step significance-voting. Here, dual-threshold still means that true prediction and false prediction have different threshold values. Two-step voting indicates there are two separate steps, in which the first step uses more stringent threshold values to generate high-confidence predictions, while the second step uses less-stringent threshold values to create extra true predictions. Significance voting allows the comparison of distance from predictive scores to threshold values between different individual predictors; and (3) integrating an artificial neural network (ANN) into each branch of the decision tree. The reason for this integration is that the outcomes of decision tree discussed in [2] are either high-confidence, or low-confidence. Therefore, ANN can be used here to refine the prediction.A large dataset containing more than 40,000 miRNA:mRNA interactions was assembled. Many samples in this dataset do not have numerical outputs from the following four miRNA target predictors: MiRanda [24], MiRDB [28], PITA [17], and TargetScan [12]. Therefore, for effectively comparing the prediction performance of predictors and integrating outputs of individual predictors into meta-predictor, all the samples in the dataset were re-organized into subsets based on the availability of numerical outputs of these individual predictors. Consequently, one D4, four D3 (D3\u20131, D3\u20132, D3\u20133, and D3\u20134), and six D2 (D2\u20131, \u2026, D2\u20136) subsets were generated. Here, \u201cD\u201d stands for dataset, the number following \u201cD\u201d shows the number of individual predictors associated with that subset, the numbers after dash represent various combinations of individual predictors (please see Method for a more detailed description of these subsets). Clearly, the performance of four individual predictors can be compared in each of these subsets.As indicated by the above analysis, the performance of individual predictors in all subsets may have a large room for improvement. In this project, an integration strategy was designed for each subset as follows (please also see Method): First, dual-threshold value and two-step significance voting are combined to sort the outputs of individual predictors. Then, an ANN was used to integrate the outputs of individual predictors to make meta-prediction. It should be noted that dual-threshold value and two-step significance-voting are used to determine the infrastructure of decision-tree. They are not used separately in decision tree in this project for the following reasons: (1) only using dual-threshold values in meta-strategy showed many limitations in our previous project [35]; and (2) using two-step significance-voting alone in meta-predictor causes a lot of issues on the selection of threshold values. Therefore, these two techniques are essentially a single component of the designed meta-strategy. With that said, there are actually two categories of techniques in the meta-predictor: decision tree (incl. Dual-threshold and two-step significance-voting) and ANN. Consequently, there are three different combinations of these techniques: (1) individual predictors + decision tree (C-I); (2) individual predictors + ANN (C-II); and (3) individual predictors + decision tree + ANN (mirTarDANN).It is expected that DANN modules have lower performance in cross-subset validation, since a specific DANN module has been trained in its corresponding subset, not the other subsets used for cross-subset validation. To further evaluate the influence of different subsets on the performance of specific modules, all the associated subsets were merged to make a merged-subset and the corresponding DANN module was re-trained in the merged-subset to see the final prediction accuracy under multi-fold cross-validation. Let\u2019s take D4 subset as an example as follows: all the D4 samples can be predicted by DANN-4 and DANN-31 modules. However, since DANN-31 was trained in the D3\u20131 subset, it has lower prediction performance in D4 dataset. Therefore, it becomes interesting to see if D4 and D3\u20131 can be merged to make a new D3\u20131 subset (i.e. *D3\u20131) to train a new DANN-31 module (i.e. *DANN-31) to improve the prediction performance in D4, D3\u20131, or *D3\u20131. In this case, for the purpose to re-train DANN-31 module, D4 and D3\u20131 become associated datasets. In this project, only the merge of a subset associated with more individual predictors into a subset associated with less individual predictors is analysed, merge in the reversed direction will result in samples with non-numerical predictive scores and therefore is not further considered. Clearly, the similar analysis can be performed for all the DANN-3x and DANN-2x modules. The results are shown in Fig.\u00a04(b) and (c), accordingly. In Fig. 4(b), the performance of each re-trained DANN module in its corresponding merged-subset was analysed. In Fig. 4(c), the performance of each re-trained DANN in its original associated subsets was analysed. Clearly, even if a new DANN module is re-trained in the corresponding merged-subset, the performance of this re-trained module is still less satisfactory in the merged-subset, as well as in the original associated subsets.Among these 172 novel true positive predictions, many are from the same dataset. For example, 43, 28, 24, 17, 16, and 14 interactions are from D3\u20133, D2\u20132, D3\u20134, D3\u20131, D4, and D2\u20134 datasets. The other thirty true positive predictions are from the other five datasets, with each dataset contributing one to ten true-positive predictions. These miRNA:mRNA interactions involve 167 mRNAs and 82 miRNAs.Among the afore-mentioned 167 mRNAs, ACO1, SMARCA2, SUMF1, TOX4, and ZMAT3 can be regulated by more than one miRNAs, multiple mRNAs belong to the same gene families, such as members in the AKAP, EIF, MED, SLC, TMEM, USP, ZBTB, ZFP, and ZMAT families. ACO1 is a cytoplasmic aconitate hydratase. When cellular iron levels are high, ACO1 binds to iron and serves as an aconitase to generate the isocitrate during the citric acid cycle [40]. When iron levels are low, ACO1 binds to iron-responsive elements (IRES) in target mRNA molecules to serve as a RNA-binding protein [41]. In the predicted novel miRNA:mRNA interactions, ACO1 is regulated by MMU-MIR-339 and MMU-MIR-10B. SMARCA2 has the function of ATP-dependent helicase and is probably a global transcription activator. It is a component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complexes [42, 43]. It is also a component of npBAF complex, and therefore critical for the development of neural stem cells [44]. SMARCA2 is bound by MMU-MIR-33 and MMU-MIR-466A. SUMF1 is a formylglycine-generating enzyme [45, 46]. Its malfunction is the cause of multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD) [47, 48]. SUMF1 is targeted by MMU-MIR-743B and MMU-MIR-488 in the predicted novel interactions. TOX4 (TOX high mobility group box family member 4) is a component of PTW/PP1 phosphotase complex, which regulates chromatin structures [49]. TOX4 is an interaction partner of MMU-MIR-221 and MMU-MIR-376C. ZMAT3 is the short name for Zinc finger matrin-type protein 3. It is a target of P53 and has functional roles in P-53 dependent regulatory pathway [50\u201352]. ZMAT3 is regulated by MMU-MIR-764 and MMU-MIR-292A.Meta-strategy is capable to integrate the advantages of different individual predictors and therefore to improve the overall prediction accuracy efficiently. as well as balance sensitivity and specificity. Nonetheless, using a simple meta-strategy to directly integrate the outputs of individual predictors may not improve the prediction performance significantly [34, 35]. Therefore, it may be critical to integrate various data analysis techniques in meta-strategy to improve the final prediction accuracy. In this project, the predictive scores of miRanda, miRDB, PITA, and targetScan were input into a decision tree. In the decision tree, dual-threshold value, two-step significance-voting, and analysis of information-gain were integrated to filter the input scores of individual predictors. The input scores were then fed into an ANN to make meta-prediction. This meta-strategy has improved the prediction performance significantly, comparing to individual predictors and other meta-predictors. With the success of this strategy, it could be expected that integrating more individual predictors, and/or more data analysis techniques, is able to further improve the prediction accuracy. While this expectation is reasonable, it should be noted that the margin effect of adding extra individual predictors into meta-predictor could be very limited [32\u201334]. In addition, adding extra individual predictors may indicate that there will be more subsets and consequently the smaller size of subsets. By taking into consideration that multiple subsets in this project have only ~\u2009300\u2013400 samples, there may be additional concerns for using more individual predictors in miRNA target meta-predictors. The data analysis techniques used in this project are essentially able to reduce noise in datasets and/or at different stages of prediction. Therefore, it can be expected that additional techniques may be used to further reduce noise, and consequently to improve prediction accuracy.The reasons for choosing the afore-mentioned four individual predictors are multi-fold. First, these four individual predictors are well designed and have been broadly used in this field. Second, these individual predictors have standalone versions, webservers, as well as pre-assembled prediction of miRNA:mRNA interactions for the entire mouse genome. Consequently, the comparison and application of our newly-designed meta-predictor becomes much easier. Third, the use of these four individual predictors is able to split the original large dataset into multiple smaller subsets, which each has reasonable amount of samples and well reduced noise as indicated by improved prediction performance. The original unsplit dataset used in this project contains more than 7000 positive miRNA:mRNA interactions and ~\u200940,000 negative miRNA:mRNA interactions. Many samples in this dataset have non-numerical values, such as \u201c-\u201d, \u201cNA\u201d, or null, in the outputs of those four individual predictors. Under the current scheme of the newly-designed meta-strategy, these non-numerical values cannot be used directly in the decision tree. Therefore, it is necessary to organize all the samples into multiple subsets based on the availability of numerical scores of individual predictors. In this way, all the samples in a subset have and only have numerical values from a specific subset of individual predictors. For example, all the samples in the D3\u20131 subset have and only have numerical predictive values from miRanda, miRDB, and PITA. Consequently, these scores can be compared to threshold values associated with the DANN-31 module of the decision tree and fed into the ANN associated with DANN-31 to make refined prediction. The second advantage of splitting a large dataset into multiple smaller subsets is to reduce the intrinsic noise of the subsets. Normally, a sample with a non-numerical value can only be assigned as false, even the sample is a positive sample. This sample is also a sample space, different from other samples with numerical values. Therefore, the presence of samples with non-numerical values increases the noise of datasets. Another advantage of using subsets is that the prediction accuracy of predictors can be measured more specifically in these subsets, and thus the comparison of prediction accuracy of different predictors in subsets is more informative. Actually, as shown in Figure 1, the performance of individual predictors has large variations in different subsets, and the variation can only be captured in the form of subset. Furthermore, comparison of various accuracy measures in different subsets of different predictors provides another practical strategy to select the most appropriate predictors. For example, if a miRNA:mRNA pair has miRanda, miRDB, and TargetScan scores (or in other words, this pair is similar to samples in the D3\u20132 dataset), ComiR can be selected to make prediction to ensure the highest sensitivity, while miRanda could be used to ensure a higher specificity.The analysis of overlap and coverage demonstrates that these four predictors have some common predictions, but also many predictor-specific predictions. Therefore, the analysis of overlap and coverage is useful in determining the infrastructure of decision tree. For majority-voting based strategy, overlap is a critical measurement. However, in significance-voting based predictor[s], although overlap is still very important, coverage plays a more critical role. In addition, majority-voting is strong in selecting part of the true-positive predictions that have very high levels of confidence, significance-voting is able to pick up additional true-positive predictions that cannot be identified by majority-voting. In this way, significance-voting improves the overall prediction accuracy and has higher potential in application. To maximize the efficacy of significance-voting, the dual-threshold value and two-step voting strategies are also critical. In the first-step voting, the thresholds are normally stricter than those of single predictors. The purpose is to select high-confidence true-positive and true-negative predictions from individual predictors. The second step voting uses less-stringent threshold values to enable the selection of additional true-positive predictions that cannot be identified by individual predictors under their default settings.After determining the infrastructure of the newly-designed meta-predictor, two sets of threshold values (the 1st-step threshold values for true positive and true negative, as well as the 2nd-step threshold values for true positive and true negative) need to be determined. Therefore, the information gain in each of the eleven datasets was analysed.Based on our previous studies where ANN or dual-threshold sequential-voting was used to integrate the predictive results of individual predictor, a novel infrastructure of meta-strategy that combines ANN and decision-tree was designed in this project to make meta-prediction of miRNA targets using predictive scores of four individual predictors, including miRanda, miRDB, PITA, and targetScan. Different from traditional decision-tree and the afore-mentioned dual-threshold sequential-voting, the new decision-tree uses dual-threshold and two-step significance voting. The combination of this new decision-tree with ANN was trained in a large-scale miRNA:mRNA interaction dataset and improved the prediction accuracy of miRNA:mRNA interactions significantly comparing to individual predictors and several other meta-predictors under multi-fold cross-validation and using independent datasets in multiple accuracy measures, such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score and MCC. Also, the availability of numerical scores of individual predictors was used to split a large dataset into multiple smaller subsets, to reduce the noise of subsets, improve the training of meta-predictor, and provide more specific evaluation of prediction performance of different predictors in the subsets. The reduce noise in the sunsets further improved the efficacy of meta-predictors developed on those subsets. The newly-designed meta-predictor identified near 200 novel miRNA:mRNA interactions that cannot be predicted by other predictors.MiRTarBase [53] and Tarbase [54] are very well designed large-scale miRNA:mRNA interaction databases. All the interactions in these two databases are validated by experimental techniques, such as reporter assay, western blot, Cross-Linking Immunoprecipitation (CLIP), and many others. The miRTarBase V7.0 contains nearly ~\u20092000 mouse miRNAs, over 7000 target mouse genes, and 40,169 mutual interactions between them. The TarBase V7.0 contains more than 400 miRNAs, over 5000 mRNAs, and 28,923 miRNA:mRNA interactions. Although both containing a large amount of experimental data, these two databases have only 457 overlapped miRNA:mRNA interactions for the entire mouse genome. This fact gives grounds for combining these two databases in this study, as well as for developing novel computational strategies to predict miRNA:mRNA interactions.MiRanda [24], MiRDB [28], PITA [17], and TargetScan [12] are four very popular predictors for miRNA:mRNA interactions. Their websites each provides a dataset containing the whole genome prediction of miRNA:mRNA interactions for mouse genome. For each possible miRNA:mRNA pair (or sample) in the genome, each predictor may produce either scored or unscored predictions. Only scored predictions were included in those datasets. There are over 810\u2009k, 630\u2009k, 2.7\u2009m, and 270\u2009k scored predictions for mouse genome, from miRanda, MiRDB, PITA, and TargetScan, respectively. Samples in these four datasets were further organized as follows: (I) Samples found in all four datasets were deposited into D4; (II) Samples found only in miRanda, MiRDB, and PITA, were saved in D3\u20131. Similarly, D3\u20132 for samples only found in miRanda, MiRDB, and TargetScan; D3\u20133 for samples only found in miRanda, PITA, and TargetScan; and D3\u20134 for samples common in MiRDB, PITA, and TargetScan; (III) Samples found only in miRanda and MiRDB were kept in D2\u20131. Similarly, there are another 5 subsets containing samples that are only found in two out of four datasets, which are D2\u20132 (MiRanda and PITA), D2\u20133 (MiRanda and TargetScan), D2\u20134 (MiRDB and PITA), D2\u20135 (MiRDB and TargetScan), and D2\u20136 (PITA and TargetScan); (IV) Samples found only in one dataset were grouped into another four datasets: D1\u20131 (miRanda), D1\u20132 (MiRDB), D1\u20133 (PITA), and D1\u20134 (TargetScan).Each DANN module uses the combination of several specific techniques including dual-threshold [35, 36], two-step significance-voting [36], and two-layer Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Dual-threshold means the threshold values of true and false predictions are different. Significance-voting refers to comparing the significance of predictive results by their Euclidean distances from corresponding threshold values. This technique is complementary to the majority-voting technique used in many studies. For example, when two predictors make true predictions and another two predictors make false predictions, comparing the number of true predictions (NT) and the number of false predictions (NF) may not lead to very useful conclusions. However, comparing the sum of distances from true thresholds value (dT) and the total distance from false threshold values (dF) may provide additional information of the relative significance of true predictions and false predictions. Two-step selection in this study uses two sets of dual-threshold values in combination with significance-voting as follows: First, the 1st-step threshold values, which are more stringent, are used to compare the number of true-prediction predictors and the number of false-prediction predictors. If the numbers are equal, the 2nd-step threshold values, which are less stringent, are used to compare the numbers of true-prediction predictors and false-prediction predictors. If the numbers are also equal, significance-voting based on the 2nd-step threshold values is applied. By using these techniques, the predictive results from individual predictors will be encoded in six different ways (see Fig. 8).The encoded predictive results will be fed into one of the eleven DANNs, which is a fully-connected two-hidden-layer ANN. There are ten, twenty, and two nodes in the first hidden, second hidden, and output layers, respectively. Since there are two nodes in the output layer, the labels of positive and negative samples are [1,0] and [0,1], respectively. The number of nodes in the input layer is determined by the number of individual predictors in that DANN module. There are 10, 9, and 8 input nodes for DANN-4, DANN-3, and DANN-2 modules, accordingly. The activation function for all the nodes is hyperbolic tangent function. However, in the output layer, the output was further transformed using: \\( {O}_i^T=\\raisebox{1ex}{${\\mathit{\\exp}}^{O_i}$}\\!\\left/ \\!\\raisebox{-1ex}{$\\sum {\\mathit{\\exp}}^{O_i}$}\\right.,i=1\\  and\\ 2 \\). In which, Oi and OTi are the original output and transformed output, respectively.Each DANN predictor is trained and validated in one of the eleven predictor-specific datasets. For each of the datasets, 20% of all samples were randomly taken out to compose an independent test dataset, the other 80% of samples were randomly and equally split into multiple subsets for multi-fold cross-validation. Based on the number of samples in each dataset, either five-fold or three-fold cross-validation was used. The corresponding DANN was trained and validated using multi-fold cross validation in its corresponding predictor-specific dataset, as well as then validated in its independent test dataset.The outputs of the afore-mentioned four individual predictors have different numerical ranges as follows: miRanda (\u2212\u20091.364, \u2212\u20090.1), miRDB (50, 100), PITA (\u2212\u200943.24, 21.4), and TargetScan (\u2212\u20099.05, 0). The default threshold values for true predictions of these predictors are <\u2212\u20091.0, >\u200980, <\u2212\u200910, and\u2009<\u2009\u2212\u20090.36, respectively. For the simplicity of future data analysis, miRDB\u2019s predictive scores are inversed by multiplying \u2212\u20091, and all the scores from each individual predictor are scaled into the range (\u2212\u20091,1). Thus, the corresponding true prediction threshold values for four predictors in their default settings are <\u2212\u20090.424, <\u2212\u20090.2, <\u20090.028, and\u2009<\u20090.920, accordingly.In which, pi is the fraction of positive (i\u2009=\u20091) or negative (i\u2009=\u20092) samples in the dataset. \u201cx\u201d is the threshold prediction score to split the dataset into two groups, fj(x) is the fraction of samples with prediction score higher than the threshold (j\u2009=\u20091) or the fraction of samples with prediction score lower than the threshold (j\u2009=\u20092), pj,k refers to the fraction of positive samples (k\u2009=\u20091) or negative samples (k\u2009=\u20092) in the j-th group.The performance of the newly designed meta-strategy was evaluated using Sensitivity (Sens), Specificity (Spec), Accuracy (Acc), F1 score (F1), and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) under multi-fold cross-validation and in independent datasets. The performance was further compared with the corresponding values of four individual predictors (miRanda, miRDB, PITA, and TargetScan), as well as another two recently developed meta-predictor: ComiR [30] and Oliveira\u2019s predictor [55]. ComiR is a recently developed meta-predictor for miRNA target prediction. By using support vector machine to integrate the predictive results of miRanda [24], PITA [17], and TargetScan [12], ComiR improved the overall prediction accuracy remarkably, but still left room for further improvement.AccuracyArtificial Neural NetworkArea under the ROC curveDecision-tree based Artificial Neural NetworkF1 scoreHidden Markov ModelMatthew\u2019s Correlation CoefficientReceiver operating characteristicSensitivitySpecificitySupport vector machineData analysed in this study are available on their original webservers.

In overall, the prediction performance of four predictors in all the datasets is not optimal and still has a lot of room for improvement. In addition, in different datasets, different predictors may have large variations in prediction performance, as indicated by the shape of ROC curves, the sensitivity and specificity under their default threshold values. More specifically, in terms of AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve), miRDB achieved the highest value in the D4, D3\u20131, D3\u20132, D3\u20134, D2\u20131, D2\u20134, and D2\u20135 datasets, PITA was ranked at the first position in the D3\u20133, D2\u20132, and D2\u20136 datasets, and miRanda obtained the best result in the D2\u20133 dataset. While using sensitivity, miRDB is better than other predictors in the D4, D3\u20131, D3\u20132, D3\u20134, and D2\u20131 datasets, PITA outperforms other predictors in the D3\u20133, D2\u20134, and D2\u20136 datasets, TargetScan beats other predictors in the D2\u20133 and D2\u20135 datasets, and miRanda exceeds others in the D2\u20132 dataset. Clearly, using predictive scores of individual predictors to split a large dataset into multiple smaller subsets may provide a novel start point for evaluating the performance of different predictors. It shall also be noted that the datasets used in Fig.\u00a01 do not contain redundant samples. By taking into consideration that predictive scores of a predictor may distribute in a very narrow range, removing redundant samples may influence the calculated prediction accuracy significantly. The details are shown in Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figure S1 and will be discussed further in the discussion section.\n\nFig. 1\nROC curves of individual predictors in the eleven newly designed non-redundant datasets. The datasets from top to bottom and from left to right are: D4, D3\u20131, D3\u20132, D3\u20133, D3\u20134, D2\u20131, D2\u20132, D2\u20133, D2\u20134, D2\u20135, and D2\u20136, respectively. Samples in the D4 dataset has prediction scores from four individual predictors, therefore, there are four ROC curves each for a predictor. Similarly, the D3 series datasets and D2 series datasets have three and two ROC curves, respectively. In each of the insets, x-axis shows the value of 1-specificity, while y-axis shows the values of sensitivity\nThe prediction performance of these three combinations in all eleven subsets under multi-fold cross-validation is presented in Table\u00a01. Clearly, the first combination has only limited efficacy in improving prediction performance. There is always large imbalance between sensitivity and specificity. The second combination may have significantly improved accuracy (ACC) in several subsets, such as D3\u20131 and D3\u20132, but very low sensitivity (Sens). The third combination showed significant improvement of prediction performance in most subsets under multiple accuracy measures. Therefore, the third combination will be used as the formal model of meta-predictor for further analysis. The third combination, MirTarDANN, has the following advantages: (1) higher accuracy in most datasets; (2) improved balance between sensitivity and specificity; (3) higher sensitivity in most datasets. The final model of MirTarDANN actually contains eleven modules, including one DANN-4, four DANN-3x, and six DANN-2x modules. Each of the modules is trained and validated in its corresponding subset, which is either D4 subset, or one of four D3-x subsets, or one of six D2-x subsets. Each subset was also split into multiple groups for multi-fold cross-validation and independent test.Table 1\nPrediction performance of three meta-predictors using three different sets of techniques\n\nC-I integrates individual predictors with a decision tree, C-II uses ANNs to integrate individual predictors, and mirTarDANN is a combination of individual predictors, decision tree, and ANNs. The performance is measured by sensitivity (Sens), specificity (Spec), and accuracy (Acc) under multi-fold cross-validation. The high-lighted values are the highest among three meta-predictors in the same subset\nFigure\u00a02 shows the comparison of accuracy, sensitivity, and F1 score under multi-fold cross validation among miRanda, miRDB, PITA, TargetScan, ComiR, and the newly designed meta-predictor mirTarDANN. Clearly, in terms of accuracy, mirTarDANN outperformed other predictors in the D3\u20133, D3\u20134, D2\u20132, D2\u20133, D2\u20134, D2\u20135, and D2\u20136 datasets, matched to others in the D2\u20131 dataset, but fell behind other predictors in the D4, D3\u20131, and D3\u20132 datasets. In terms of sensitivity, mirTarDANN exceeded other predictors in almost all the datasets except D3\u20132 and D2\u20131. In these two datasets, four individual predictors have low sensitivity but high accuracy due to having high specificity (see Additional file 1: Table S2). This is also supported by the fact that the sensitivity of mirTarDANN is higher than individual predictors in these two datasets. Anyhow, in these two datasets, ComiR achieved reasonably high or the highest values on both sensitivity and accuracy. In terms of F1 score, mirTarDANN achieved significantly improved F1 score in D3\u20133, D3\u20134, and another five D2 datasets (except D2\u20131), and equal or comparable scores with ComiR and/or other individual predictors in the D4, D3\u20131, and D3\u20132 datasets. In D2\u20131 dataset, ComiR\u2019s F1 score beat all other predictors, including mirTarDANN. The overall accuracy and sensitivity of mirTarDANN averaged in all the eleven datasets under multi-fold cross validation is 59.5 and 59.0%, which are 3 and 9% higher than ComiR, the predictor at the second position. The F1 and MCC values of mirTarDANN as an average of all the eleven datasets are 0.492 and 0.287, compared to 0.329 and 0.101 from ComiR, respectively (see Additional file 1: Table\u00a0S2 & S3).\n\nFig. 2\nComparison of prediction performance of different predictors in eleven newly-designed datasets under multi-fold cross validation. X-axis shows the eleven newly-designed datasets, while the y-axis shows (a) accuracy, (b) sensitivity, and (c) F1 score, respectively. Error bars are standard deviation from multi-fold cross validation. In the D4 dataset, the performance of mirTarDANN was compared with four individual predictors and ComiR. In each of the D3 series datasets, mirTarDANN was compared to ComiR, and three out of four individual predictors. In each of the D2 series datasets, mirTarDANN was compared to ComiR and two out of four individual predictors. When calculating the accuracy of individual predictors, their default cutoff values were used. For ComiR, a false discovery rate of 5% was recommended by the developer to determine the cutoff. Therefore, based on the calculations of 50 randomly selected miRNAs and their targets in the datasets, 0.82 was used as the cutoff of ComiR\nFigure\u00a03 shows the comparison of accuracy, sensitivity, and F1 score among four individual predictors, ComiR, and mirTarDANN in the independent test datasets. The overall trend of data in this figure is similar to those in Fig.\u00a02. Basically, mirTarDANN has the highest accuracy in all datasets except D4, D3\u20131, and D3\u20132. In terms of sensitivity, mirTarDANN outperformed other predictors significantly in D3\u20131, D3\u20133, D3\u20134, D2\u20132, and D2\u20134 datasets, fell behind ComiR in the D4, D3\u20132, D2\u20131, and D2\u20133 datasets, and also fell behind one or two individual predictors in the D2\u20131, D2\u20135, and D2\u20136 datasets. As to F1 score, mirTarDANN was only behind ComiR in the D2\u20131 and D2\u20133 datasets. As an average in all the eleven test datasets, the accuracy of mirTarDANN and ComiR is 65.1% vs 56.2%, and the sensitivity of mirTarDANN and ComiR is 50.6% vs 51.4%, the F1 scores are 0.455 (miRTarDANN) vs 0.315 (ComiR), and the MCC values are 0.276 (mirTarDANN) vs 0.119 (ComiR) (see Additional file 1: Table S4 and S5).\n\nFig. 3\nComparison of prediction performance of different predictors in the independent datasets that each is associated with one of the eleven newly-designed datasets. X-axis shows the datasets, while the y-axis shows (a) accuracy, (b) sensitivity, and (c) F1 score, respectively. Only mirTarDANN has error bars since mirTarDANN has multiple sets of parameters optimized under multi-fold cross-validation\nThe meta-predictor is composed of eleven modules, and each module is associated with a specific set of individual predictors. Each module is also trained and validated in its corresponding subset, in which all the samples have and only have numerical predictive scores from that set of individual predictors. Apparently, modules trained in subsets with less number of individual predictors may be used to make prediction for samples with more predictive scores. For example, DANN-21 can be used to make prediction for samples in the D4 and D3\u20131 subsets. In other words, D4 samples can be predicted by not only DANN-4 module, but also four DANN-3x modules and six DANN-2x modules. Samples in D3\u20131 subset have miRanda, miRDB, and PITA scores, therefore, D3\u20131 samples can also be predicted by DANN-21 (requires miRanda and miRDB scores), DANN-22 (requires miRanda and PITA scores), and DANN-24 (requires miRDB and PITA scores) modules. In this project, the prediction accuracy of a trained DANN module in a non-corresponding subset is called cross-subset accuracy. Figure\u00a04 shows the performance of DANN modules in different subsets. In this figure, x-axis is the prediction accuracy and y-axis shows the sensitivity. Therefore, when a DANN module has good performance in a subset, the symbol shall be at the upper-right corner along the diagonal line. Clearly, as shown in Fig.\u00a04(a), all the DANN modules in mirTarDANN have lower performance in cross-subset test.\n\nFig. 4\nPerformance of eleven DANN modules in different subsets. aPerformance of original trained DANN modules in different subsets. b Performance of DANN modules re-trained in merged subsets. c Performance of re-trained DANN modules in original subsets. X-axis shows the prediction accuracy, while y-axis shows the sensitivity. Each symbol stands for the performance of a specific subset predicted by specific DANN module. Larger symbols are performance of eleven original DANN modules trained in their corresponding subsets, while small symbols show performance of original DANN modules in non-corresponding subsets or performance of re-trained DANN modules in various subsets. The subsets are represented by the colours filled in the symbols as follows: D4:black, D3\u20131:red, D3\u20132:green, D3\u20133:yellow, D3\u20134:blue, D2\u20131:pink, D2\u20132:cyan, D2\u20133:grey, D2\u20134:dark red, D2\u20135:dark green, D2\u20136:dar yellow. DANN modules are denoted by the shape of symbols as follows (All DANN-3x have dark edges, while all DANN-2x have red edges): DANN4:star, DANN-31:up triangle, DANN-32:down triangle, DANN-33:square, DANN-34:diamond, DANN-21:up triangle, DANN-22:down triangle, DANN-23:square, DANN-24:diamond, DANN-25:hex, DANN-26:circle\nIn all the eleven datasets, the newly designed meta-predictor mirTarDANN exclusively identified 298 experimentally validated miRNA:mRNA interactions that cannot be identified by any of the individual predictors under their default settings as shown in Fig.\u00a05. Out of these 298 miRNA:mRNA interactions, 126 can be predicted by ComiR. Therefore, mirTarDANN identified 172 novel miRNA:mRNA interactions that can not be identified by four individual predictors and ComiR (see Fig. 5).\n\nFig. 5\nNumber of novel miRNA:mRNA interactions identified by mirTarDANN in the eleven newly-designed datasets. Grey bars shows the number of novel interactions compared to four individual predictors, including miRanda, miRDB, PITA, and TargetScan. Dashed grey bars show the difference between mirTarDANN and one of the other five predictors, including four individual predictors and ComiR\nOut of the afore-mentioned 82 miRNAs, 36 may regulate multiple novel-predicted mRNAs. In which, MMU-MIR-129, MMU-MIR-340, MMU-MIR-362, and MMU-MIR-9 may regulate 12, 9, 8, and 8 mRNAs, respectively. These thirty-seven downstream mRNAs are involved in over thirty signalling pathways, including cancer-related pathways, MARK signalling pathway, Ras signalling pathway, hippo signalling pathway, RNA transport pathway, spliceosome pathway, etc. Especially, among those thirty-seven downstream genes, PDGFRA and MYLK are involved in eighteen and eight signalling pathways, respectively. In addition to the afore-mentioned four miRNAs, another 12 miRNAs each may regulate more than three novel-predicted mRNAs as shown in Fig.\u00a06(a). The regulated signalling pathways and the number of involved genes of each pathways for the afore-mentioned 36 miRNAs are presented in Fig. 6(b).\n\nFig. 6\nFunctional analysis of novel miRNA:mRNA interactions identified mirTarDANN, but not identified by four individual predictors and ComiR. a List of miRNAs and the corresponding number of mRNAs that can be regulated by each of these miRNA. Only miRNAs having more than three mRNA targets are shown in the Fig. (b) KEGG pathways containing three or more genes, which are found in the novel miRNA:mRNA interactions\nThe reason for using those four individual predictors can also be rationalized in the analysis of overlap and coverage. The overlap of two predictors refers to the numbers of overlapped true positive and overlapped true negative predictions, the coverage of two predictors shows the maximum number of non-overlapped true positive or true negative predictions of two predictors. Clearly, overlap is an indicator of the similarity between two predictors, while coverage shows the maximum number of correct predictions that can be made by these two predictors. For the simplicity of comparison, both overlap and coverage are shown in percentile by dividing the total number of either positive or negative samples in that dataset. Figure\u00a07(a) shows the values of overlap and coverage of different pairs of predictors for positive samples in the eleven datasets. Clearly, the values of pairwise overlap are in most cases around or below 20% except in the following three datasets: D3\u20134, D2\u20135, and D2\u20136, where the values of positive sample overlap are still less than 30\u201340%. In terms of pairwise coverage, the values normally reach to ~\u200940% in the D3\u20133, D2\u20132, and D2\u20133 datasets, to ~\u200960% in the D4, D3\u20131, D3\u20132, and D2\u20131 datasets, and to ~\u200970% in the D3\u20134, D2\u20134, D2\u20135, and D2\u20136 datasets. The maximum values of coverage of multiple predictors in the D4 and D3 series datasets are normally ~\u200910% higher than the highest pairwise coverage in that dataset. The overlap and coverage of negative samples are presented in Fig.\u00a07(b). In the D4, D3\u20132, D3\u20132, D3\u20133, D2\u20131, and D2\u20132 datasets, the pairwise overlap for negative samples are normally between 40 and 50%, and the pairwise coverage values are around ~\u200990%. In the D3\u20134, D2\u20132, D2\u20133, and D2\u20134 datasets, the values of pairwise overlap are between 10 and 30%, and the values of pairwise coverage are normally around 80%. In the D2\u20135 and D2\u20135 datasets, the overlap is below 10% and the coverage is at ~\u200960%. In the datasets involving three or four predictors, the maximum values of coverage of multiple predictors are normally 5% higher than the highest pairwise coverage values. Clearly, combining different predictors may improve the prediction results significantly due to the fact that the pairwise coverage values are much higher than the prediction accuracy of individual predictors.\n\nFig. 7\nOverlap and coverage between individual predictors for (a) positive samples and (b) negative samples. Grey bars are the values of overlap between two predictors (pairwise overlap). Each cap indicates the value of overlap for a specific pair of predictors. Dark grey bars stand for the values of coverage between two predictors (pairwise coverage), with caps each for a specific pair of predictors. Black bars show values of all-inclusive coverage, which are calculated from all predictors in that dataset. Apparently, only D4 and D3 series datasets have the all-inclusive coverage\nThen, samples in these subsets were compared with miRTarbase and TarBase. If a sample is found in either of these two databases, it is assigned as a positive sample, otherwise, negative sample. Afterwards, duplicated samples were identified if there was less than a 2% difference between all predictor scores of two samples. One of the duplicated samples was randomly selected and then removed. It should be noted here that since each D1 series dataset only contains samples with one prediction score, they were not further considered in this study. Consequently, there are in total eleven predictor-specific datasets, including one D4, four D3 series, and six D2 series datasets (Table\u00a02).Table 2\nNumbers of samples in each of the eleven newly-designed datasets\nThe infrastructure of the meta-predictor is shown in Fig.\u00a08. For each pair of query miRNA and mRNA sequences, predictions are first made using four individual predictors including miRanda, MiRDB, PITA, and TargetScan. The predictive results are next examined to see if they are scored predictions. Based on the results of this examination, the predictive results are then input into a corresponding Decision-tree based Artificial Neural Network (DANN) to make the final meta-prediction. For example, if a query miRNA;mRNA sequence pair only has scored predictions from miRanda and miRDB, these two predictive scores will be fed into DANN-2-1, which uses the predictive results of miRanda and miRDB, and is trained in dataset D2\u20131.\n\nFig. 8\nInfrastructure of decision-tree based meta-predictor. Query miRNA:mRNA sequences are firstly fed into miRanda, miRDB, PITA, and TargetScan to get individual predictions. These individual predictions may be scored or unscored (null output). Based on the scored individual predictions, a specific module of decision tree based artificial neural networks (DANN) will be selected. For example, if only miRanda and miRDB have scored predictions, module DANN-2-1 will be selected. There are eleven modules in the pipeline, each module corresponds to one of the eleven datatsets and uses scores different predictors as follows, DANN-4: miRanda, miRDB, PITA, and TargetScan; DANN-3-1: miRanda, miRDB, and PITA; DANN-3-2: miRanda, miRDB, and TargetScan; DANN-3-3: miRanda, PITA, and TargetScan; DANN-3-4: miRDB, PITA, and TargetScan; DANN-2-1: miRanda and miRDB; DANN-2-2: miRanda and PITA; DANN-2-3: miRanda and TargetScan; DANN-2-4: miRDB and PITA; DANN-2-5: miRDB and TargetScan; DANN-2-6: PITA and TargetScan. \u201cY\u201d above an arrow and \u201cN\u201d along an arrow represent \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo\u201d. \u201cT/F\u201d inside a circle stands for true (T) or false (F) prediction. \u201cNT1\u201d is the number of predictors that make true prediction using the 1st-level true threshold values, and so on so forth for NF1, NT2, NF2. \u201cb1\u201d and \u201cb2\u201d are the differences of the predictions score from their corresponding 1st-level threshold values. \u201cc1\u201d and \u201cc2\u201d are the differences of the predictions score from their corresponding 2nd-level threshold values. \u201cdT2\u201d and \u201cdF2\u201d are the Euclidean distances of prediction scores from their corresponding 2nd-level threshold values for true (T) predictions and false (F) predictions, respectively. The infrastructure of the 2-hidden-layer ANN is described in the text. There are in total eleven DANNs\nInformation Gain (IG) was calculated as a function of predictive score as follows:Figure\u00a09 shows the information gain as a function of the scaled prediction score for each individual predictor in the D4 dataset, as well as the distribution of positive and negative samples at different prediction scores in the D4 dataset (see Additional file 1: Figure S2 for data in the other ten datasets). Clearly, the plots of information gain of four predictors are very different from the curves of distribution of positive and negative samples. In other words, information gain provides additional information that cannot be easily produced by the comparison of distribution between positive and negative samples. By notation, a spike in the plot of information gain indicates that the predictive score associated with this spike is able to split positive samples from negative samples in an optimal way. Therefore, all the spike-associated prediction scores are candidates of threshold values. By taking into consideration that positive samples\u2019 prediction scores are smaller in the scaled prediction scores, the threshold values for true predictions should be smaller than the threshold values for false predictions. In addition, the 1st-step threshold values should be more stringent than the 2nd-step threshold values. With that said, the 1st-step threshold values for true predictions should be smaller than 2nd-step threshold values for true predictions, and the 1st-step threshold values for false predictions should be larger than the 2nd-step threshold values for false predictions. When selecting the parameters for each DANN-x module, an initial set of parameters that satisfy the afore-mentioned conditions were selected to evaluate the final prediction accuracy. At this point, normally the values associated with the largest four peaks were used, and the accuracies associated with the first-step true/false as well as the second-step true/false are calculated. Then, one of the threshold values was changed in a way satisfying the afore-mentioned criteria, and the prediction accuracy of this module is re-evaluated to compare with the previously calculated accuracy. If the parameter has been changed twice and the accuracy has been continuously decreasing, the selection of this parameter will be terminated and the associated threshold value will be determined. Apparently, the tuning of parameters has four subsequent phases: first-step true, second-step true, first-step false, and second-step false. If the change of first-step threshold value (or true/false threshold values) affected the corresponding second-level threshold value (or false/true threshold values), the second-level threshold value (or false/true threshold values) will also be changed accordingly. Consequently, multiple combinations of threshold values were tested, and the final determined true/false threshold values of miRanda, miRDB, PITA, and TargetScan in the D4 dataset are (\u2212\u20090.179/0.844, \u2212\u20090.702/0.059, \u2212\u20090.449/0.257, 0.896/0.982) as the 1st-step threshold values, and (0.067/0.199, \u2212\u20090.480/\u2212\u20090.269, \u2212\u20090.203/\u2212\u20090.107, 0.964/0.972) as the 2nd-step threshold values (see Additional file 1: Table S1 for the final threshold values of the other ten datasets).\n\nFig. 9\nInformation gain compared to the distribution of positive and negative samples in the D4 dataset for (a) miRanda, (b) miRDB, (c) PITA, and (d) TargetScan.

(DOCX 642 kb)", "s12864-019-5525-4": "A key developmental transformation in the life of all vertebrates is the transition to sexual maturity, whereby individuals are capable of reproducing for the first time. In the farming of Atlantic salmon, early maturation prior to harvest size has serious negative production impacts.We report genome wide association studies (GWAS) using fish measured for sexual maturation in freshwater or the marine environment. Genotypic data from a custom 50\u2009K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array was used to identify 13 significantly associated SNP for freshwater maturation with the most strongly associated on chromosomes 10 and 11. A higher number of associations (48) were detected for marine maturation, and the two peak loci were found to be the same for both traits. The number and broad distribution of GWAS hits confirmed a highly polygenetic nature, and GWAS performed separately within males and females revealed sex specific genetic behaviour for loci co-located with positional candidate genes phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein-like (picalm) and membrane-associated guanylate kinase, WW and PDZ domain-containing protein 2 (magi2).The results extend earlier work and have implications for future applied breeding strategies to delay maturation in this important aquaculture species.The development of sexual maturation in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is a complex process informed by both genetic and environmental cues. It is highly variable, with extremes in age and size at maturation the result of adaptation to maximise fitness and reproductive success [1]. The trait reflects a trade-off, whereby older maturing animals have higher reproductive success but an elevated risk of mortality prior to reproduction [2]. Life-history strategies typically include one or more years of freshwater residence post-hatch followed by multiple years at sea, before the commencement of maturation and migration to the native river for spawning. A proportion of fish stay at sea only 1 year and mature early (grilse). Further, male juveniles (parr) can mature precociously in freshwater, bypassing the marine phase completely [3]. Factors influencing the timing of maturation, including temperature and photoperiod manipulation are described in detail elsewhere [4].The practise of salmon farming promotes high growth and adiposity through increasing food availability in comparison to wild stocks. The consequence is an elevated proportion of farmed animals entering maturation younger and at weights below harvest size, generating substantial production inefficiency. This can be partly addressed through modified management practise and selective breeding for delayed maturation, however the positive correlation with growth makes uncoupling positive and negative production impacts challenging. Existing estimates indicate the age and size of maturation are moderately heritable, ranging from 0.15 to 0.48 [5]. Genome wide association studies seeking to identify genes regulating disease and production traits are now becoming routine for farmed Atlantic salmon following the development of SNP genotyping platforms [6\u201310]. The first GWAS to investigate age at sexual maturation used a SNP tool comprising 6.5\u2009K loci [7]. The study reported separate associated genome regions controlling grilsing and late maturation, suggesting the traits may be under independent genetic control. More recently, sequence based GWAS has made significant progress in wild populations through the comparison of one and three sea winter maturation animals. These two studies identified a single locus in European Atlantic salmon associated with age at maturity [11, 12]. The causal gene is likely to be the vestigial-like family member 3 gene (vgll3), which has a role in both regulation of adiposity and age at menarche in humans [13].The objective of this study was to characterise the distribution of SNP effects that control variation in the timing of maturation, and identify the genes and genomic regions likely to regulate two maturation traits in salmon farmed in Tasmania. A custom SNP50 genotyping array was used to perform GWAS for 2721 fish with maturation data collected in the marine environment, while a parallel GWAS used 1846 related fish scored for maturation in freshwater. The results represent a detailed view of the genomic regions that explain variation in both traits, and provide key information for the design of selective breeding approaches to manage a substantial production challenge for the salmon farming industry.The GWAS population is from the Salmon Enterprises of Tasmania (SALTAS) selective breeding program which has been described previously [14\u201316]. A subset of individuals from the 2012, 2013 and 2014\u2009year classes were measured for one of two traits. Maturation in the freshwater environment (FMAT) was collected for 1867 progeny at 22\u2009months by visual assessment for the emergence of secondary sexual characteristics. This included development of a kype and altered coloration, meaning FMAT is a binary trait scored as either immature or mature. Progeny were from a total of 374 families. Sibs of this cohort were transferred to sea cages at approximately 13\u2009months of age and grown for a further 9\u2009months, before being assessed for maturation in the marine environment (MMAT) using the same method. A total of 2739 animals were scored for MMAT at 22\u2009months of age, derived from 554 families.Fin clips were used for the extraction of DNA by a commercial provider (Center for Aquaculture Technologies, San Diego, California). Genotyping was performed using a custom 50\u2009K Affymetrix SNP array by the same commercial provider, containing loci largely derived from an earlier custom 220\u2009K SNP Affymetrix array developed by the Centre of Integrative Genetics (CIGENE) and AquaGen [11]. Sex for all progeny was assigned using intensity data from three DNA probe sets designed to detect the presence of exon 3 and exon 4 of sex-determining gene (sdY) [17]. Probes were included into the design of a custom 50\u2009K array, and animals assigned as male where each sdY assay returned a positive signal, and as female where no intensity data was observed from any sdY assay. Raw genotype calls were quality controlled to remove i) SNP with sample call rate\u2009<\u200990%; ii) SNP with minor allele frequency\u2009<\u20091% and iii) samples with missing genotypes in excess of 5%. A comprehensive pedigree check was performed by comparing the coefficients of the additive relationship matrix and the genomic relationship matrix (G matrix) calculated via the first method described in [18]. A total of 39 fish were identified with multiple inconsistencies and removed. After quality control, 46,500 SNP remained for 4567 animals measured for either FMAT (1846) or MMAT (2721). Association analysis was carried out using mixed linear method analysis (MLMA) [19]. To reduce the rate of false positive associations, the approach includes construction of a genetic relationship matrix (GRM) to identify family based structure before reducing the contribution of closely related individuals during estimation of the test statistic. To avoid double fitting trait associated SNP in the model, the GRM was estimated with candidate markers excluded (MLMAe) using the MLMA-LOCO method as implemented in the Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA) [20]. This reduced the inflation of observed association signals compared with other methods such as linear regression (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01). Analysis for both traits (MMAT and FMAT) was performed using all animals after fitting sex as a covariate. Sex specific analyses were also performed. The data was divided into male (1884) and female (2820) subsets measured for FMAT (670 males, 1317 females) and MMAT (1214 males, 1503 females). Analyses were performed for each trait and sex subset. Permutation testing was used to define significance thresholds for the trait and sex specific analyses [21]. One thousand permutation tests were performed for each analysis by permuting the phenotypic values. Chromosome specific thresholds were calculated by taking the maximum test statistic after each permutation for each chromosome. The distribution of those maximum values after the 1000 permutations was then used to calculate the threshold. Thresholds with a significance level of 0.05 were used. The genome wide threshold was not used as it was driven by a higher number of associations on a select small number of chromosomes. Estimates of the proportion of genetic variance (%VG) explained by SNP with significant associations were established by fitting all significant SNP, the GRM used in the association analysis and a pedigree containing all relationships within the population in generalised linear mixed models in ASReml-R [22]. The proportion of the genetic variance was calculated as the squared effect of the SNP divided by the estimate of the total genetic variance. SNP were mapped to ICSASG_v2 (accession GCA_000233375.4 [23]) to facilitate plotting of loci in genomic order. PLINK v1.9 [24] was used to estimate linkage disequilibrium as r2 for SNP pairs on Ssa25. This was performed after setting the LD value threshold to 0.0 to allow the estimation of values across the full range from one to zero (\u2212-ld-window-r2). To perform fine-mapping using dense SNP collections, haplotype phasing and imputation to sequence across chromosome Ssa11 was carried out using Eagle version 2.3.2 [25] and Minimac3 [26] respectively. A reference panel was used for imputation, containing 19 animals sequenced to 30 fold depth of coverage [17]. All reference panel fish are from the Saltas selective breeding program (year class range 2005\u20132013), meaning they are direct relatives of the GWAS population. Genome sequence from reference animals were used to identify 358,683 variants across Ssa11 as described previously [17]. The 50\u2009K array used for GWAS contained 801 SNP on Ssa11 common to the reference panel SNP set which were used to impute full Ssa11 sequence for 4606 animals from the GWAS population. The potential effect on imputation when using only 19 animals in the reference panel prompted us to filter the imputed data based on the R2 value produced by Minimac3. SNP having r2\u2009<\u20090.4 were removed, leaving 10,940 SNP. The dataset was further filtered to a final set of 458 common SNP spanning the 3\u2009Mb critical interval (Mb 80\u201383) on Ssa11. Association analysis was carried out using linear regression as implemented in PLINK v1.9 [24].RNA-Seq datasets from eight Atlantic salmon tissues (brain, gut, liver, muscle, skin, spleen, ovary and testis) were downloaded from Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02). Raw reads were mapped to ICSASG_v2 [23] using default parameters of BOWTIE [27] as implemented in TopHat2 version 2.1.1 [28]. Binary alignment map (BAM) files were converted into sequence alignment map (SAM) files using SAMtools version 1.4 [29]. Python package HTSeq version 0.7.2 [30] was applied to count unique reads mapped to exons. Raw counts were analyzed using the edgeR package [31] in the R statistical computing environment [32]. Count raw data for each of the eight tissue samples were normalized using the scaling normalization method implemented in edgeR to achieve cross-sample normalization. The trimmed mean of M-values (TMM algorithm) [31] was subsequently used to calculate the scaling factors according to the library size of each sample. Following edgeR normalization, the expression values FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) were log2 transformed. Transformed FPKM data for candidate genes were obtained and plotted as heat map using the R package pheatmap (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pheatmap/index.html).The observation that the top ranked loci were shared between traits prompted us to attempt fine-mapping using additional loci. We focussed on the picalm gene on chromosome 11 as the associated SNP resides within the gene. The availability of whole genome sequence from 19 ancestors of the GWAS population [15] facilitated an imputation approach to saturate the region surrounding picalm with additional SNP. We imputed genotypes at 458 SNP in 4606 animals (1867 with MMAT and 2739 with FMAT trait records) across a 3\u2009Mb region (Mb 80\u201383) spanning the Ssa11 peak SNP AX-87621437 (Mb 81.52, Table 1). Repeating the GWAS with imputed SNP resolved the critical interval to a 7.9 Kb region containing 9 loci in complete linkage disequilibrium (Additional\u00a0file\u00a06). One of the 9 loci was AX-87621437, suggesting the genome wide peak SNP is located close to the causal variant.Sexual maturation is likely to involve genes with non-random tissue expression profiles. Reproductive maturation takes place in the testis and ovary, and is likely mediated by genes with preferential expression in other tissues including the brain and the pituitary [39\u201341]. This prompted analysis to determine if the genes identified as positional candidates in GWAS using all animals exhibit specialised gene expression profiles. Published Atlantic salmon RNA-Seq data from eight tissues were mapped onto Atlantic salmon genome ISCGA_v2 [23] (Additional file 2), before normalised expression values for 45,531 genes were used to cluster the tissue collection. This revealed two clusters, with the ovary, brain and testis grouping separately to the other five tissues (Fig. 1c). To assess if the positional biological candidates exhibit a different expression profile, the analysis was repeated using the top 10 genes arising from GWAS. For both traits, the expression profiles of the positional candidates returned tissue relationships that differed substantially from that built using all genes. Brain clustered separately to the other seven tissues using genes implicated in marine maturation (Fig. 3d). For FMAT, the expression profile grouped the two reproductive organs (testis and ovary) together and separate from other tissues.The high proportion of males entering early maturation, measured here as 55% for marine fish at 22\u2009months, represents a major challenge for the Atlantic salmon farming industries. A key objective of this study was therefore to characterise the distribution of genes underlying variation in maturation, in advance of optimising approaches for selective breeding. GWAS is the best approach to explore the genetic architecture of a given trait and the outcome is difficult to predict beforehand. For example, some disease resistance and life history traits which may be expected to be highly polygenic have proven to be controlled by a small number of major genes in salmon [11, 12, 41], while growth rate appears to be highly polygenic [7, 13]. This study demonstrated both freshwater and marine maturation, as measured in Tasmanian farmed Atlantic salmon, are controlled by a sizable number of loci with none generating exceptionally strong association peaks. We failed to observe SNP explaining a sufficiently large proportion of genetic variation given the low heritabiliy of the traits to warrant the development of dedicated DNA diagnostics for marker assisted selection, or which present compelling targets for gene editing in a research setting to deepen our understanding of sexual maturation. The conclusion relating to the major objective is therefore that genomic prediction is the most efficient method to achieve genetic gain for either trait.Despite the absence of a single major association peak, the modest number of SNP associations detected are likely to be enriched for true biological drivers of maturation given the sizable number of loci and animals used in the experiment. The low heritability of each trait, coupled with only moderate correlation between them, suggests it was not surprising that few genomic regions were associated independently to both MMAT and FMAT. There were, however, two notable exceptions for loci on Ssa10 and Ssa11 that implicate the genes picalm and magi2 in maturation (Tables 1 and 2). It is worthwhile noting that for both SNP, neighbouring loci failed to exhibit significant association signal to form broad association peaks. This raises the possibility the genomic location of the two peak SNP may not be correct, and suggests caution is required with regard the involvement of the picalm and magi2 genes. Neither gene has been directly implicated in fish maturation previously, however both do represent plausible position candidate genes [34, 35]. Interestingly, both display sex specific behaviour in GWAS whereby the strength of association, effect size and the proportion of genetic variance explained is restricted to males and absent from females. This phenomenon has been observed previously in controlling age at maturity in wild populations of Atlantic salmon, mediated by sex specific dominance patterns at the vgll3 locus on chromosome 25 [2, 11]. The identification here of sex specific effects at two additional independent loci, within a genetically distinct population and explaining up to 20% of the genetic variance, supports the possibility that sex specific genetic architecture is an important component controlling Atlantic salmon maturation.A number of earlier studies have sought to identify genes and chromosomal regions controlling salmonid maturation [7, 11, 12]. A key consideration in comparing earlier results to our findings concerns the equivalence of the maturation traits under investigation. A number of critical differences exist including i) the age at which sexual maturation was measured here compared with earlier work; ii) genetic history spanning either European and North American derived populations and iii) variation in environmental factors such as feed availability and photoperiod experienced by farmed versus wild populations. It is worthwhile considering that in this study, two maturation traits measured in one population intentionally managed to remove environmental variation until animals were around a year old still shared a low proportion of significant GWAS hits and displayed only moderate correlation of family means. It is therefore perhaps unrealistic to anticipate the identification of shared genes between this and earlier studies. Despite the differences, we proceeded to characterise the vgll3 region due to the large effect size it imparts on maturation in both wild European [11] and North American fish [43]. Earlier work prioritised two non-synonymous vgll3 mutations as most likely to be the functional variant. One is polymorphic and segregating in the Tasmanian population (Met54Thr), the second appears fixed for the allele associated with high maturation age (Asn323Lys), and GWAS clearly showed a lack of association in the region containing vgll3. This suggests Met54Thr is not the functional mutation, because if it exerted a phenotypic consequence it should generate an association signal which wasn\u2019t present. Discounting Met54Thr as causal doesn\u2019t mean Asn323Lys must therefore be responsible for controlling the phenotypic variation, however it adds to the weight of evidence in its favour. A more practical implication is there appears to be no benefit in using vgll3 DNA diagnostics to promote delayed maturation in the Tasmanian breeding program.GWAS revealed a highly polygenetic nature for both maturation traits, with few common SNP suggesting they are likely controlled by largely distinct genetic mechanisms. Only two variants were significantly associated with both traits, and each display sex specific effects restricted to male fish. Neither GWAS suggest vgll3 plays a major role as measured in the Tasmanian population. These results increase our understanding of the genetic basis of maturation and direct future strategies to delay maturation in this important aquaculture species.A-kinase anchoring protein 11Binary alignment mapCentre of Integrative GeneticsMaturation in the freshwater environmentFragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped readsGenome-wide complex trait analysisGenetic relationship matrixGenome wide association studiesMembrane-associated guanylate kinase, WW and PDZ domain-containing protein 2Mixed linear method analysisMaturation in the marine environmentPhosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein-likeSalmon Enterprises of TasmaniaSequence alignment mapSex-determining geneSingle nucleotide polymorphismSequence Read ArchiveTrimmed mean of M-valuesVestigial-like family member 3The research was funded by CSIRO, Tassal and Saltas.

Maturation was assessed as two traits due to the life cycle of Atlantic salmon and the associated breeding program design (Additional\u00a0file\u00a03). Maturation in freshwater (FMAT) was assessed in 1846 progeny from 374 families at 22\u2009months of age and scored as a binary trait. Matured individuals (n\u2009=\u2009534 or 29%) were identified by visual assessment of secondary sexual characteristics such as the development of a kype and altered coloration. A significant sex bias was observed in early maturing animals, consistent with previous findings [11]. For example, around half of males had matured at 22\u2009months of age compared with only 20% of females (Fig.\u00a01, \u03c72\u2009=\u2009141, p-value\u2009=\u20091.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2212\u200932). The weight of mature animals was no different among females. However, males maturing in freshwater were significantly heavier (Fig. 1; p-value\u2009=\u20091.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2212\u20099). These biases were stronger for marine maturation (MMAT) which was measured in a separate group of 2721 animals from 554 families at 22\u2009months of age, approximately 9\u2009months after their transfer into sea cages. For example, only 10% of female fish presented as mature and they were significantly heavier than their immature female relatives (Fig. 1; p-value\u2009=\u20090.0086). In excess of half of the males had matured in the marine environment (55%) and they were also significantly heavier (Fig. 1; p-value\u2009=\u20098.7\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2212\u200925). This is consistent with maturation in wild populations, where selection favours earlier maturation in males compared with females [11]. High accuracy family based heritability estimates were obtained. This revealed heritabilities at the lower end of the range amenable to GWAS (FMAT h2\u2009=\u20090.15\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1; MMAT h2\u2009=\u20090.20\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2). The correlation of family means was estimated to determine if the traits should be considered as biologically independent. This revealed the traits are only moderately correlated (r2\u2009=\u20090.76), prompting their subsequent treatment in GWAS as independent.\n\nFig. 1\nRelationship of sex and weight for two maturation traits. The observed proportions of mature and immature fish are shown for each sex and trait (a). The distribution of weight is shown separately as a function of both sex and maturation status for freshwater (b) and marine maturation (c)\nTo commence GWAS, genotyping was performed using a custom 50\u2009K SNP array before quality filters were applied to define a total of 46,500 SNP. Analysis of both traits was performed using mixed linear model association incorporating a genetic relationship matrix. This is important for populations with family substructure, to reduce the over-estimation of significance and the incidence of false positive association. The strength of SNP association, estimated using 1846 genotyped animals scored for FMAT, is given in Fig.\u00a02. A total of only 13 SNP were significantly associated, suggesting a polygenic trait. Significantly associated loci were distributed across the genome, with the ten most extreme loci on Ssa 9, 10, 11, 14, 17, 24 and 29 (Table\u00a01). The highest ranked SNP was located at Mb position 60.2 on Ssa10 (AX-87354755,\u2212Log p-value\u2009=\u200910.99), 169 Kb away from the magi2 gene. It explains a moderate proportion of genetic variance (17.7%) with an effect size larger than other strongly associated loci (Table 1). The gene belongs to the guanylate kinase superfamily and exhibits a pattern of gonad expression that strongly suggests a role in ovarian differentiation [33]. The second most strongly associated SNP (Ssa11, AX-96411005, \u2212Log p-value\u2009=\u20096.73) is located within the phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein-like gene picalm. It explains a lower proportion of genetic variation and has a smaller effect size (Table 1), however it has a known role in spermiation and is responsive to both estrogen and androgen when assayed in mouse seminiferous tubule culture. This suggests a role in mediating hormone regulation in reproductive tissues [34, 35]. While regulators of ovarian development (magi2) or steroid hormones (picalm) represent plausible positional candidates, there is currently little known about their role in fish. The identity of the top 10 ranked SNP for freshwater maturation, along with physically co-located genes, are given in Table 1 and Additional\u00a0file\u00a04.\n\nFig. 2\nGWAS for two maturation traits in Atlantic salmon. SNP associations with freshwater (FMAT, a) and marine maturation (MMAT, b) are shown in genomic order for a karyotype consisting of 29 autosomes. The strength of association is given as the \u2013Log10(p-value) and the horizontal lines represents the genome wide (red) or chromosome wide (blue line) significance thresholds. Expression levels from 45,531 genes was used to cluster a set of eight Atlantic salmon tissues. This was compared with heat maps of tissue-specific expression observed using positional candidate genes obtained from GWAS for FMAT (d) and MMAT (e). The values used are the log2 transformed fragment per kilobase million estimates (refer to the materials and methods)\nTable 1\nTop 10 most strongly associated loci for freshwater maturation (FMAT)\n\nThe chromosome number (Ssa), SNP identifier and base pair position of loci is given ranked using their strength of trait association given as \u2013Log10(p-value). The effect size was derived from single SNP GWAS using the categoric assignment of mature or non-matured animals (0 or 1) at 22\u2009months of age. The proportion of genetic variance (%VG) was estimated using a model fitting all significant SNP with both pedigree and SNP derived GRM. The complete of significant loci is provide in Additional file 4\nThe genomic distribution of associated SNP for marine maturation is also shown in Fig. 1 and listed in Table\u00a02. A higher number of SNP exceeded the genome wide threshold for MMAT (48, Additional\u00a0file\u00a05) and the most significantly associated regions were located on chromosomes 6, 9, 10 and 11. The two highest ranked SNP for marine maturation are also the most significantly associated for freshwater maturation. The effect size for these SNP is similar for both traits, however the proportion of genetic variation explained was lower for MMAT compared with FMAT (Tables\u00a01 and 2). Beyond these two loci on Ssa10 and Ssa11, there was no overlap of significantly associated SNP shared between the two traits. Other highly associated SNP for marine maturation include a broad association signal on Ssa9 (Mb 112.8\u2013119.6, Table 2). The peak contains four of the ten most strongly associated loci genome wide, and each of the four SNP is located within a gene (p2rx5, cld4, tsk and LOC106612817). Of these, claudin-4 (cld4, LOC106612824) is a strong positional candidate as claudins are junction proteins and control electrolyte transportation across cell-cell junctions. Several claudins have roles in gonadal development such as claudin-3 which acts to control spermatocytes [36], while claudin-4 expression is responsive to estrogen receptor antagonists during development [37]. Human claudin-4 has been well studied due to over expression in ovarian cancer, and the gene\u2019s normal function is important for ovarian follicular development [38].Table 2\nTop 10 most strongly associated loci for marine maturation (MMAT)\n\nThe table has the same format as Table 1, and the complete list of all significant SNP for is provided in Additional file 5\nThe observation that maturation exhibited sexually dimorphic behaviour (Fig. 1) prompted GWAS using males and females separately. This sought to determine if the association signals obtained using all animals originated predominantly from males, females or the combined contribution of both sexes. Analysis of the freshwater trait revealed 19 and 24 significant SNP in male and female fish respectively (Fig.\u00a03). Male maturation in freshwater was associated with regions on Ssa5, 10, 11 and 15 while SNP were identified in females within regions on Ssa10 (22\u201327\u2009Mb) and Ssa21 (42\u201343\u2009Mb) (Additional\u00a0files\u00a07 and 8). Comparison between the results revealed none of the SNP or regions were shared, suggesting male and female maturation in freshwater are not obviously controlled by the same major genes. Interestingly, the top two loci identified using all animals (AX-87354755 and AX-96411005) were reconstituted in analysis using male fish but absent in the female specific analysis. For example, the proportion of genetic variation explained by the chromosome 10 SNP (AX-87354755) was 19.5% in males and non-significant in females despite its allele frequency being similar in both sexes (Additional\u00a0files\u00a09, 10, 11).\n\nFig. 3\nGWAS for freshwater maturation traits conducted separately within females (a)\u00a0and males\u00a0(b). As for Fig. 2, SNP associations are represented as\u2013Log10(p-values) and positional genes obtained from GWAS were used to examine the relationship between eight tissues based on gene expression\u00a0(c)\nSex specific analysis for marine maturation returned broadly similar results (Fig.\u00a04). The two most significantly associated SNP on Ssa10 and 11 within the male population (AX-87354755 and AX-96411005) were again not significant using females alone (Additional files 9, 10, 11). Beyond these two SNP, the majority of 29 significant loci identified in males for MMAT (17 or 58%) overlap the set obtained using both sexes (Additional\u00a0file\u00a012). This contrasts the observation in females, where only 2 of the 12 significant loci were found in GWAS using all fish (Additional\u00a0file\u00a013). Taken together, the analysis suggests both maturation traits exhibit a sex specific genetic architecture whereby males more strongly contribute to the GWAS results obtained using both sexes.\n\nFig. 4\nGWAS for marine maturation traits conducted separately within females (a)\u00a0and males\u00a0(b). SNP associations are represented as \u2013Log10(p-values) and positional genes obtained from GWAS were used to examine the relationship between eight tissues based on gene expression\u00a0(c)\nThe final analysis was prompted by two earlier genetic studies that identified a\u2009<\u20091\u2009Mb region on Ssa25 that controls a large proportion of the variation in the age that wild European Atlantic salmon return mature to spawn in freshwater [11, 42]. Two genes vgll3 and A-kinase anchoring protein 11 (akap11) containing three non-synonymous mutations (vgll3 Met54Thr, vgll3 Asn323Lys and akap11 Val214Met) were identified as putatively functional. Given sea age is associated with the timing of sexual maturity, we sought to determine if variation at either gene is associated with maturation in the Tasmanian breeding population. To commence, whole genome sequence from the same 19 animals used for imputation were used to estimate the allele frequency at each of the three putatively causal variants (Table\u00a03). The most strongly associated vgll3 variant (Asn323Lys) [9] was monomorphic within the SALTAS genomes, with every animal homozygous for the 323Lys variant associated with delayed maturation and 3 sea winter animals. Both alleles were detected at the second vgll3 mutation (Met54Thr), with the frequency of the 3 sea winter allele (54Thr) much higher in the SALTAS genomes (0.78) than the frequency for the early maturing allele (0.23). In preparation for fine mapping the vgll3 region, we incorporated five SNP into the design of the Custom SNP50 chip spanning a 62 Kb interval (Mb position 28.659\u201328.721). Inspection of the resulting association signals revealed no evidence for variation at, or in the chromosomal regions surrounding vgll3, influencing freshwater or marine maturation (Additional\u00a0file\u00a014). Interestingly, SNP within and immediately flanking the gene displayed complete monomorphism (bp positions 28,703,619, 28,666,898, 28,707,912, 28,720,779 and 28,658,151). This suggested the presence of a selective sweep at the gene, prompting analysis of SNP polymorphism across the chromosome. No evidence of reduced variability or increased homozygosity was observed, indicating the locus has not experienced a hard selection sweep (Additional\u00a0file\u00a014). The alternative explanation for monomorphism is the vgll3 associated variants are fixed in North American derived populations due to their divergence from the European stocks in which the polymorphisms were discovered.Table 3\nGenotype and allele frequencies are given for three SNP, previously associated with either early (E) or late (L) maturing wild Atlantic salmon [9]\n\nData is given for 19 fish derived from whole genome sequence [16].

However, the differences in induction and regeneration capacity of embryonic callus (EC) among various genotypes result in genotypic dependence in genetic transformation.In this study, embryonic calli of two maize inbred lines with strong redifferentiation capacity and two lines with weak redifferentiation capability were separately subjected to transcriptome sequencing analysis during the early redifferentiation stages (stage I, 1\u20133 d; stage II, 4\u20136 d; stage III, 7\u20139 d) along with their corresponding controls. A total of ~\u2009654.72 million cDNA clean reads were yielded, and 62.64%~\u200969.21% clean reads were mapped to the reference genome for each library.

By analyzing the common and specific DEGs of the four materials, we found that there were 321 upregulated genes and 386 downregulated genes identified in the high-regeneration lines (141 and DH40), whereas 611 upregulated genes and 500 downregulated genes were specifically expressed in the low-regeneration lines (ZYDH381\u20131 and DH3732). Analysis of the DEG expression patterns indicated a sharp change at stage I in both the high- and low-regeneration lines, which suggested that stage I constitutes a crucial period for EC regeneration. Notably, the specific common DEGs of 141 and DH40 were mainly associated with photosynthesis, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, ribosomes, and plant hormone signal transduction. In contrast, the DEGs in ZYDH381\u20131 and DH3732 were mainly related to taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, fatty acid elongation, starch and sucrose metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and plant circadian rhythm. More importantly, WOX genes, which have an ancestral role in embryo development in seed plants and promote the regeneration of transformed calli, were specifically upregulated in the two high-regeneration lines.Our research contributes to the elucidation of molecular regulation during early redifferentiation in the maize embryonic callus.Maize (Zea mays L.) is a primary global crop supplying the food, feed, and industrial materials industries. Genetic transformation is presently widely used to improve yield and stress resistance and for gene function validation in maize, which largely depend on callus induction and regeneration from maize immature embryos [1\u20133]. Armstrong et al. [1] classified maize calli into three types, namely, I-, II -, and III-type calli, based on the callus characteristics. Among these types, only the II-type callus, known as embryonic callus, has cell totipotency and the ability to regenerate into whole plants and is therefore widely applied to genetic transformation in maize. Previous studies revealed that the genotype is an important factor that restricts the regeneration of the maize embryonic callus [4\u20137, 85]. Research on quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping revealed that the regenerative capability of the embryonic callus is controlled by multiple genes in maize [8, 86].Several functional genes have been shown to play important roles in callus regeneration in plants. The root stem cell regulators PLETHORA1 (PLT1) and PLETHORA2 (PLT2) must be activated by PLETHORA3 (PLT3), PLETHORA5 (PLT5), and PLETHORA7 (PLT7) to establish competent shoot regeneration progenitor cells [11, 12, 14]. A CDK (cyclin-dependent kinase) inhibitor (inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase, ICK) has been reported to improve the regenerative capacity of embryonic callus in Arabidopsis [20]. Meanwhile, the expression of WOX5 (WUSCHEL-related homeobox\u00a05) in the quiescent center (QC) is considered a marker of Arabidopsis root stem cell niche [10]. Whereas, WUSCHEL (WUS), a marker of shoot apical meristem (SAM) identity, together with CLAVATA1/3 (CLV1/3), maintains the SAM stem cell niche through a feedback pathway in Arabidopsis [15]. WUS also influences shoot stem cell induction activity in the roots [16] and the conversion of root apical meristems (RAMs) to SAMs depending on the exogenous plant growth hormones applied in vitro [17]. In addition, as an AP2/ERF transcription factor, WIND1 (WOUND INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION 1) was proven to upregulate the expression of ESR1 (ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGEENRATION 1) gene that encodes another AP2/ERF transcription factor, promoting Arabidopsis shoot regeneration [9, 13]. SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (SERK1), which is involved in the acquisition of embryogenic competence in plant tissue culture, is strongly expressed during the early stages of somatic embryogenesis in Arabidopsis [18, 19]. The downregulation of multiple CDK inhibitor ICK/KRP genes additively enhances both the shoot and root regeneration abilities of root-derived callus in Arabidopsis, indicating that CDK activity is a major factor for in vitro organogenesis [20]. Nishimura et al. reported that a ferredoxin-nitrite reductase (NiR) was responsible for rice regeneration ability [83]. In a recent study, WOX2 (WUSCHEL-related homeobox\u00a02) and BBM (Baby Boom) genes were together introduced into maize by genetic transformation, resulting in the increased number of resistant seedlings regenerated from the transformed immature embryos [79]. In our latest study, 40 candidate genes were identified as being associated with the regenerative capacity of embryonic callus in maize, with regulators in cell fate determination, auxin transport, seed germination, or embryo development [85]. The present study was aimed at revealing the regulatory mechanisms associated with the early redifferentiation of embryonic callus by using the transcriptome data of four maize inbred lines with different regeneration capacities.Gene expression levels were calculated using FPKM and were estimated using Cufflinks [24\u201326]. A correlation value between biological replicates for each of the stages was calculated according to the FPKM result. The Pearson\u2019s correlations were mostly higher than 0.90 (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Figure S2), indicating good repeatability of the sequencing data.To obtain functional annotations of the genes involved in EC regeneration capacity, we carried out GO analysis for the specific common DEGs. Both the upregulated and downregulated genes of the specific common DEGs of 141 and DH40 were categorized into three functions: Biological Process (BP), Cellular Component (CC), and Molecular Function (MF). As shown in Additional\u00a0file\u00a05: Figure S3, many terms of plant growth and development were significantly enriched in these biological processes, and the significantly enriched entries (FDR\u2009\u2264\u20090.05 or P-value \u22640.05) are displayed in Additional\u00a0file\u00a06: Tables S9\u2013S11. Among the upregulated genes, 265 were assigned with functional annotations involved in 332 terms for BP, 65 terms for CC, and 13 terms for MF. BP included photosynthesis, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate metabolic process, isopentenyl diphosphate biosynthetic process, cellular aldehyde metabolic process, phospholipid biosynthetic process, biosynthetic process and metabolic process of pigment, shoot and system form morphogenesis, the process of embryonic development, and seed development. CC involved chloroplast and chloroplast part, plasmids and plasmid part, and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase complex. Meanwhile, MF included the structural constituent of ribosome, transcription factor activity and core RNA polymerase binding, and chlorophyll binding. In the downregulated genes, 247 were annotated with functions, including seven terms in BP (regulation of jasmonic acid-mediated signaling pathway, response to wounding, regulation of defense response, regulation of response to stress, regulation of signaling and signal transduction, and regulation of cell communication), two in CC (integral component of membrane, intrinsic component of membrane), and four in MF (transcription co-repressor activity, transcription cofactor activity, transcription factor activity and transcription factor binding, and protein binding).The specific common DEGs of ZYDH381\u20131 and DH3732 with 611 upregulated genes and 500 downregulated genes were also divided into three functional categories of BP, CC, and MF (Additional\u00a0file\u00a07: Figure S4), and the significant GO terms of enrichment (FDR\u2009\u2264\u20090.05) are shown in Additional\u00a0file\u00a08: Tables S12\u2013S14. For the upregulated genes, a total of 458 DEGs were assigned functional annotations, including 13 terms in BP (nucleosome assembly and nucleosome organization, protein-DNA complex assembly and protein-DNA complex subunit organization, DNA conformation change and DNA packaging, oxidation\u2013reduction process, monocarboxylic acid biosynthetic process, and fatty acid biosynthetic process), 16 in CC (protein-DNA complex, nucleosome, chromosomal part, chromosome, and cell wall), and 14 in MF (protein heterodimerization activity, protein dimerization activity, beta-glucosidase activity, galactosidase activity, and beta-galactosidase activity). As for the downregulated genes, 314 DEGs had functional annotations with 47 GO terms in BP (regulation of nucleobase-containing compound metabolic process, regulation of RNA metabolic process, regulation of nitrogen compound metabolic process, regulation of macromolecule biosynthetic process, auxin-activated signaling pathway, oligosaccharide biosynthetic process, the metabolic process and biosynthetic process of strigolactone, and cellular response to light stimulus), one in CC (nucleus), and six in MF (DNA binding, nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity, polysaccharide binding, and photoreceptor activity).The early redifferentiation of EC is a process of somatic embryogenesis and adventitious shoot regeneration. By comparing the DEGs of the four inbred lines, we found that a number of genes were involved in processes of photosynthesis, hormone signaling transduction, cell cycle, embryo and meristem initiation, circadian rhythm of plant, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Based on the functional annotations, we identified some significantgenes closely related to callus regeneration (listed in Additional\u00a0file\u00a011: Table S17).Plant circadian rhythm: A total of 17 specifically downregulated DEGs in both ZYDH381\u20131 and DH3732 were associated with plant circadian rhythm (Fig. 6b). Of these DEGs, seven were annotated as Dof zinc finger protein DOF5.5 (CDF1), and two DEGs (Zm00001d003477 and Zm00001d016915) were annotated as cryptochrome 1 (CRY1). Especially CRY1 and ELF3, which respond to blue light and therefore affect the photomorphogenesis of the plant, the other DEGs respond to red light and regulate plant cell elongation and flowering (Additional\u00a0file\u00a015: Figure S8).Plant hormone signal transduction mechanisms: Plant hormones play an important role in EC regeneration [53\u201360, 80]. Based on the specific common DEGs of 141 and DH40, a total of 29 downregulated genes were involved in hormone signal transduction (Fig. 6c). Of these, nine genes were annotated as jasmonate ZIM domain-containing protein (JAZ), and four genes were annotated as gibberellin receptor GID1 (GID1). Some specifically upregulated genes in 141 and DH40 were also related to the hormone transduction signal (Fig. 6c), including ABA receptor PYR/PYL family (PYL) (Zm00001d016105) and GID1 (Zm00001d007908, Zm00001d022320). Notably, JAZ and MYC2, as important factors of jasmonic acid signal transduction, were found to play critical roles in senescence and the plant stress response [88] (Additional\u00a0file\u00a016: Figure S9). Furthermore, GID1 and PIF4, which participate in the signal transduction pathway of gibberellin, have important functions in stem growth and the induction of seed germination (Additional\u00a0file\u00a016: Figure S9). For the specific common DEGs of ZYDH381\u20131 and DH3732, a total of 30 downregulated genes were related to plant hormone signal transduction (Fig. 6c). Among them, 11 genes were annotated as auxin-responsive protein IAA (IAA). SAUR (Zm00001d017397, Zm00001d018200), auxin responsive GH3 gene family (GH3) (Zm00001d010697), and ARF (Zm00001d014690) were identified in the downregulated genes of the specific common DEGs of ZYDH381\u20131 and DH3732. These genes are all involved in auxin signal transduction, which is important for cell enlargement and plant growth (Additional\u00a0file\u00a017: Figure S10). Additionally, EIN3 and EBF play roles in ethylene signal transduction, which is related to senescence and fruit ripening (Additional file 17: Figure S10). Ten specifically upregulated genes in ZYDH381\u20131 and DH3732 were also involved in ethylene signal transduction. In summary, these DEGs participate in the signal transduction pathways of several hormones, including auxin, cytokinin (CTK), gibberellin (GA), jasmonic acid (JA), and brassinosteroid (BR), indicating that the cross-talking of these hormones plays important roles in EC regeneration.Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis: A total of 24 upregulated DEGs were related to the metabolic pathway of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, specifically in ZYDH381\u20131 and DH3732 (Fig. 6d and Additional\u00a0file\u00a018: Figure S11). Of these, beta-glucosidase is a glycoside hydrolase enzyme that participates in various cell functions, such as the catalysis of disaccharide and oligosaccharide bonds, catalysis of cell wall components, and the activation of phytohormones [27\u201331]. POD protects tissues and cells from oxidative damage by catalyzing the reduction of H2O2, and its accumulation accelerates the browning of the callus [28]. PAL catalyzes the nonoxidative elimination of ammonia from L-Phe to yield trans-cinnamate in the first step of the phenylpropanoid pathway, which plays an essential role in plant development and the stress response [29\u201331]. In the two lines with poor EC regeneration, the DEGs involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis were all increased at the same stage, which suggested that phenylpropanoid biosynthesis negatively influenced EC redifferentiation by accelerating callus browning.The DEGs related to cell cycling: For the specific common DEGs of 141 and DH40, one upregulated gene and two downregulated genes were related to cell cycle regulation (Fig. 6e), including cell division protease FtsH (Zm00001d036371) and cyclin-dependent kinase 12/13 (Zm00001d022041, Zm00001d042285). In addition, 10 upregulated genes and four downregulated genes were assigned to this category for specific common DEGs of ZYDH381\u20131 and DH3732 (Fig. 6e). Of these, cyclin-dependent kinase 12/13 (CDK12_13) belongs to CDKs, which are the core regulators of the cell cycle and are assumed to control cell differentiation and proliferation in response to phytohormone signals [32, 33]. Furthermore, cyclin A (CCNA) and cyclin B (CCNB) are both members of the cyclin family, which regulates CDK activity [34]. Cell division protease FtsH (FtsH) is a part of ATP-dependent proteases, which function in protein quality control and regulation [35].Moreover, Zm00001d035535, which encodes a putative WUSCHEL homeobox protein (WOX), was specifically upregulated in 141 and DH40 at all the three stages, whereas Zm00001d042821, annotated as WUSCHEL-related homeobox\u00a09-like (WOX9), was significantly downregulated in ZYDH381\u20131 and DH3732 in stage III (Fig. 6e). WOX family proteins have been proved to regulate embryo development and callus regeneration [78, 82]. Therefore, the cross-talk of these DEGs related to the cell cycle and WOX could positively influence embryonic callus regeneration.Cluster analysis of the relative expressions of these DEGs (Additional\u00a0file\u00a019: Figure S12) showed that inbred lines 141 and DH40 were clustered into one group, while ZYDH381\u20131 and DH3732 as well as the three stages of each lines were separately clustered together. Furthermore, stage II and III were categorized into one class, whereas stage I was alone. These results indicated that the expression levels of these DEGs between the high- and low-regeneration lines were significantly distinct. The responses of these DEGs were rapid, being largest in the first stage and smaller in the following stages.Light, which is closely related to the gain of energy and metabolic processes, is usually an important factor affecting growth, organogenesis, and the formation of plant products, including both primary and secondary metabolites [36]. A number of reports have mentioned that plant regeneration from a callus requires light and that plant regeneration derived from a callus is effectively increased in light compared to the dark [36\u201341]. Rikiishi et al. reported that light probably controls shoot regeneration from calli by modifying cytokinin levels and/or responses, and blue light signals act in the photoinhibition of shoot regeneration in immature barley embryo culture [38]. Other researchers have shown that light intensity and photoperiod exert a significant influence on shoot regeneration from a callus [36, 39]. However, there are few reports related to the specific molecular mechanism of the effect of light on the regeneration of embryo-derived EC in maize. In this study, we found that many specifically upregulated DEGs in the high-regeneration lines were related to photosynthesis. Furthermore, plant circadian rhythm was the most significant pathway enriched with downregulated DEGs in the low-regeneration lines. It is clear that photosynthesis and plant circadian rhythm both require light (Additional\u00a0file\u00a012: Figure S5 and Additional\u00a0file\u00a015: Figure S8). We speculated that light might regulate callus regeneration mainly by responding to photosynthesis and plant circadian rhythm.Photosynthesis is the basic energy conversion process on Earth, facilitating the utilization of the energy from sunlight by living organisms [42]. In this study, photosynthesis, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, and photosynthetic antenna proteins were the three significantly upregulated enriched pathways in the high-regeneration lines. Photosynthetic antenna proteins, which are specialized pigment\u2013protein complexes, allow for the capture of energy from sunlight, thereby participating in the initial step of photosynthesis [43]. Chlorophyll, a compound of magnesium porphyrin that absorbs energy from light, is one of the most important pigments related to photosynthesis [44]. The DEGs involved in the pathway of photosynthesis were associated with photosystem I (PS I), photosystem II (PS II), photosynthetic electron transport, and F-type ATPase, all of which play significant roles in the process of photosynthesis. Sergio et al. showed that adventitious root formation in leafy cuttings of hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) was affected by leaf photosynthesis, which provides the carbohydrate supply for this intensive metabolic process [45]. Some previous studies reported that the process of somatic embryogenesis and embryo germination demonstrated photosynthetic capacity [46\u201348]. The present study also indicated that EC gradually developed the photosynthetic apparatus and photosynthetic capacity for further autotrophy in this regeneration process, considering that the relative expression levels of most DEGs related to photosynthesis were gradually increased (Fig. 6a and Additional\u00a0file\u00a012: Figure S5).Plant circadian rhythms are associated with the synchrony of the plant with the light cycle of its surrounding environment, providing the plant with information on the season, thereby informing flowering and pollinator attraction [49, 50]. In the pathway of plant circadian rhythm, Dof zinc finger proteins, phytochrome A and B (PHYA, PHYB), cryptochrome 1 (CRY1) were associated with downregulated expression in the low regeneration lines. Of these, Dof proteins, as transcription factors, are a subfamily of zinc finger proteins particular to the plant kingdom that are essential in the regulation of many plant growth and development processes, such as seed germination and the expression of some genes associated with photosynthesis [51, 52]. Moreover, PHYA is the main phytochrome in seedlings grown in the dark but rapidly degrades in light to produce CRY1 [49, 50]. Therefore, the downregulated expression of the DEGs related to plant circadian rhythms might be detrimental to the redifferentiation of EC (Fig. 6b and Additional\u00a0file\u00a015: Figure S8).A number of DEGs were related to plant hormone signal transduction in both the high-and low-regeneration lines. Interestingly, in 141 and DH40, the specific common DEGs involved in hormone signal transduction were mainly associated with the signal transduction of JA, GA, BR, and ABA, whereas the majority of those in ZYDH381\u20131 and DH3732 were related to the signal transduction of auxin, CTK, BR, and GA (Additional\u00a0file\u00a016: Figure S9 and Additional\u00a0file\u00a017: Figure S10). JA plays an important role in plant growth and development, the stress response, and secondary metabolism processes, and JAZ is a plant-specific negative regulator of JA responsive genes, containing the conserved domain of ZIM and the Jas domain [53, 54]. In tissue culturing of the garlic bulb, the efficiency of shoot regeneration was improved by the addition of 1\u201310\u2009\u03bcM JA in B5 basic medium [55]. In our study, JAZ was significantly downregulated in 141 and DH40. Given its negative regulation of downstream JA responsive genes, we speculated that the downregulated expression of these genes prompted the expression of downstream responsive genes and therefore motivated the regeneration of the callus. GA regulates plant growth by influencing stem growth and inducing germination [56], and the receptor protein GID1, DELLA protein, and PIF are involved in the signal transduction pathway of GA. In the tissue culture of immature barley embryo, the accumulation of ABA inhibited the shoot regeneration of the callus derived from immature barley embryos [57]. The downregulated DEGs related to the transduction of GA and ABA in our study might play a role in the regeneration of EC derived from immature maize embryos. Previous studies indicated that the balance of auxin and CTK is key to controlling the dedifferentiation and differentiation of plant cells, and either shoots or roots can be regenerated from a callus by adjusting the auxin\u2013cytokinin ratios of the induction medium [58\u201360]. For example, a study on de novo shoot regeneration in Arabidopsis thaliana revealed that ARF3 directly bound to the promoter of ATP/ADP ISOPENTENYLTRANSFERASE5 (AtIPT5) and negatively regulated AtIPT5 expression, thereafter causing the abnormal biosynthesis of CTK and ultimately resulting in organ regeneration disruption [60]. Our study indicated that most of the DEGs related to auxin and CTK transduction were increased in 141 and DH40 but decreased in the poor regeneration lines (Fig. 6c), suggesting that the transduction of auxin and CTK is critical for callus regeneration. BR is a naturally produced class of plant steroid hormones and is typically involved in cell elongation, cell division, and differentiation throughout the plant life cycle and regulates many developmental processes, from seed germination to flowering and senescence [61, 62]. Research on cotton regeneration via somatic embryogenesis showed that BR had a stimulatory effect on the maturation of somatic embryos, but negatively affected callus growth [63, 64]. In this study, the DEGs associated with the transduction of BR were downregulated in 141 and DH40 but displayed inverse trends in the other two lines, which indicated that the transduction of BR might be negatively correlated with EC redifferentiation. In combination, these findings suggest that the regeneration process of embryogenic callus depends on the coordination of various hormones.In our previous studies, the low-regenerating embryonic calli turned brown more easily, which is associated with cell disorganization and eventual cell death. Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis is induced by several stresses [65, 81], and we found it had significantly enriched pathways with specific common DEGs in ZYDH381\u20131 and DH3732, mainly including POD, PAL, and \u03b2-glucosidase. Notably, all of the DEGs were upregulated in ZYDH381\u20131 and DH3732 but downregulated or unchanged in 141 and DH40. Some studies have indicated that callus browning is a typical feature and a major obstacle in callus culturing and is related to polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and POD enzymatic activities [66\u201368]. A study on the plant regeneration of pine species via somatic organogenesis showed that cell death was correlated with elevated levels of peroxides, and the addition of antioxidants inhibited callus browning by reducing the accumulation of peroxidase [28]. PAL activity is correlated with xylogenesis and nodule induction in bean callus culture [69]. \u03b2-glucosidase activity is associated with cell lignification, and the production of lignin compounds in the callus of pine species was considered to be the result of stress reactions [70]. In the present study, the upregulated expression of genes related to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis was probably due to the response to environmental stress during EC regeneration, which might cause embryonic callus browning and hinder embryonic callus regeneration.Some genes involved in cell cycle regulation and embryogenesis were differentially expressed, including FtsH, CDK, CCNA, CCNB, and WOX. Most of the cell cycle-related genes were upregulated in ZYDH381\u20131 and DH3732 but downregulated or unchanged in 141 and DH40, except embryogenesis-related genes (WOX), which were upregulated in 141 and DH40 but downregulated in ZYDH381\u20131 and DH3732. Among them, FtsH is the main thylakoid membrane protease found in organisms that performs oxygenic photosynthesis, and its malfunction causes cell division defects and growth arrest [35, 71]. Cell cycle regulation involves the differential expression of some cell-cycle genes during all phases of plant development. CDKs are a type of core cell cycle regulator that are regulated by the presence of cyclins [33, 72, 73]. We discovered that most of the cell cycle-related DEGs (FtsH, CDK, CCNA, CCNB) were significantly upregulated in the two poor regeneration materials but exhibited opposite trends in the two high-regeneration materials. Accordingly, we suggested that the increased expression of these DEGs facilitated the maintenance of the condition of EC and hindered the redifferentiation of EC. The WOX family (with 15 members) is a class of transcription factors that specifically exists in plants, including WUS and WOX1-WOX14 in Arabidopsis, and plays an important role in the stem cell maintenance of SAM and RAM, the development of lateral organs, the formation of floral organs, and embryo development [74\u201377]. Previous studies showed that WOX played an ancestral role in embryo development in seed plants, and the connection among polar auxin transport (PAT), PIN-FORMED (PIN), and WOX in the regulation of embryo patterning in seed plants was strengthened by the study of Palovaara et al. [78]. Lowe et al. also obtained plantlets with increased resistance from transgenic callus by overexpressing the maize BBM and WUSCHEL2 (WUS2) genes [79]. In this study, the WOX genes were upregulated in the two high-regeneration capacity materials but downregulated in the other lines, which verified the positive regulatory role of WOX genes in callus regeneration.In maize, the obvious differences in induction and regeneration capabilities of EC among various genotypes result in genotype dependence in genetic transformation. In this study, transcriptome analysis of the EC of the four maize inbred lines showed that the specific common DEGs of the high-regeneration lines were mainly associated with photosynthesis, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, ribosomes, and plant hormone signal transduction, while those of the low regeneration lines were mainly related to taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, fatty acid elongation, starch and sucrose metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and plant circadian rhythm. More importantly, WOX genes that have an ancestral role in embryo development in seed plants and promote the regeneration of transformed calli were specifically upregulated in the two high-regeneration lines. Our research provides new insight into molecular regulation during the early redifferentiation of a maize embryonic callus.In our previous study, we obtained two high-regeneration lines (141, DH40) and two low-regeneration lines (ZYDH381\u20131 and DH3732) from a natural population of 144 maize inbred lines [85, 89]. Furthermore, 141 and DH3732 both belong to NSS group, whereas DH40 and ZYDH381\u20131 were classified into Tropical group and SS group, respectively [90]. In the present study, the immature embryos of 1.0\u20131.5\u2009mm in length were collected from the four lines at 12 d after self-pollination and then cultured in modified N6 medium supplemented with 2,4-D under aseptic and aphotic conditions at 27\u2009\u00b0C for 25 d to induce embryonic callus (EC). The embryo-derived EC was subsequently transferred to new N6 medium and cultured for 20 d to subculture the EC, which was then cultured in MS medium at 27\u2009\u00b0C in 12\u2009h light/d for 9 d for redifferentiation. No replacement of fresh media was conducted during each of the culture phases. The specific components of the medium were listed in Additional\u00a0file\u00a020: Table S1. Total RNA was isolated from a pool of three calli for each sample at 0\u20139 d during redifferentiation by using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen). RNA from 1 to 3 d samples after redifferentiation (stage I sample, green callus forming) were mixed in equal proportions, as were RNA from 4 to 6 d (stage II sample, embryoid and less adventitious bud emerged) and 7\u20139 d (stage III sample, mass adventitious bud forming), with the 0 d RNA being used as the control (CK). The four RNA samples of each line were then separately submitted to transcriptome analysis using Illumina sequencing, with three biological replicates.Clean reads were obtained by filtering low-quality reads, adaptor-polluted reads, and reads with a high content of unknown base (N) reads. Then, the clean reads were mapped to the reference genome and genes of maize available at RefGen_V4 (\u00a0http://www.gramene.org/) using Bowtie2. Gene expression levels were calculated with RSEM. The Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM) method was used to estimate transcript expression levels in all the samples. DESeq2 was used to detect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between each selected sample pair. The DESeq2 parameters included fold change (FC)\u2009\u2265\u20092.00 and adjusted P-value \u22640.05. Hierarchical clustering of the DEGs was performed using the pheatmap package in R. The DEGs were clustered according to their expression levels using ExpressCluster software to investigate their expression patterns. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway annotations and enrichment analyses were based on the Gene Ontology Database (www.geneontology.org) [21] and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway (www.genome.jp/kegg) [22], respectively. The calculated P-values was subjected to Bonferroni correction [23], using the corrected P-value \u22640.05 as a threshold.The expression level ranges of the DEGs are displayed in Fig. 7b. In line 141, the relative expressions (compared to CK) of these DEGs ranged from \u2212\u20095.864 to 5.863, \u2212\u20096.516 to 6.366, and\u2009\u2212\u20096.479 to 6.404 at stage I, stage II, and stage III, respectively. For DH40, the FC of the DEGs ranged from \u2212\u20096.449 to 6.488, \u2212\u20097.613 to 8.679, and\u2009\u2212\u20096.257 to 8.477 in the three stages, respectively. The expression of the DEGs in ZYDH381\u20131 ranged from \u2212\u20095.214 to 5.914, \u2212\u20096.726 to 6.144, and\u2009\u2212\u20095.130 to 6.573 at stage I, stage II, and stage III, respectively. In DH3732, these DEGs were more sensitive to EC regeneration than the other lines, with FC values ranging from \u2212\u200910.440 to 8.431, \u2212\u200910.246 to 8.402, and\u2009\u2212\u200910.397 to 9.122 at these stages, respectively.To validate the DEGs obtained from the Illumina sequencing, 10 genes (Zm00001d041327, Zm00001d033049, Zm00001d018178, Zm00001d047789, Zm00001d019518, Zm00001d018157, Zm00001d008230, Zm00001d022041, Zm00001d049387, Zm00001d014723) were randomly selected to conduct quantitative real-time PCR analysis using an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR System. GADPH (Zm00001d049641) was used as the endogenous control. cDNA synthesis was carried out using 1\u2009\u03bcg of total RNA. The corresponding primers were designed using the Primer 3 online tool and are listed in Additional\u00a0file\u00a021: Table S2. The amplification program was performed according to the standard protocol of the Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR System: 40\u2009cycles of 98\u2009\u00b0C for 2\u2009min, 98\u2009\u00b0C for 2\u2009s, and 59\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009s, followed by a thermal denaturing step to generate the melting curves for amplification specificity verification. All reactions were run in triplicate, including non-template controls. Statistical analysis was performed using the 2-\u25b3\u25b3CT method [87].Abscisic acidAuxin response factorBiological ProcessBrassinosteroidProtein brassinosteroid insensitive 1Cellular ComponentCyclin ACyclin BCyclin-dependent kinaseCallus differentiating rateControlCallus plantlet numberCytokininDifferentially expressed genesEIN3-binding F-box proteinEmbryonic callusEthylene-insensitive protein 3Million mapped readsCell division protease FtsHGibberellinGibberellin receptor GID1Gene OntologyJasmonic acidKyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and GenomesMolecular FunctionTranscription factor MYC2Phenylalanine ammonia-lyasePhytochrome-interacting factor 4PeroxidaseRoot apical meristemsShoot apical meristemSAUR family proteinWUSCHEL homeobox proteinWUSCHELThis work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (31871637) and the Young Scientists Fund of Sichuan Province (2016JQ0008) and the Key Fund of the Department of Education of Sichuan Province (15ZA0004).The reference genome and genes of maize are available from RefGen_V4 (http://www.gramene.org/).

The CDR (callus differentiating rate) and CPN (callus plantlet number) of inbred lines 141 and DH40 were much higher than DH3732 and ZYDH381\u20131 (Fig.\u00a01a) [85]. For the high-regeneration materials (141 and DH40), some small adventitious buds grew from the callus at 3 d, a mass of adventitious buds were generated at 6 d, and little plantlets formed at 9 d. For the low-regeneration materials (DH3732 and ZYDH381\u20131), only some calli became green after 6 d, and no adventitious bud formation was observed during the whole process (Fig. 1b). Based on the morphological features of 141 and DH40, the early redifferentiation of EC was divided into three stages: stage I (1\u20133 d), stage II (4\u20136 d), and stage III (7\u20139 d).\n\nFig. 1\nPhenotypic evaluation of the four inbred lines. a Regeneration ability of the EC of the four inbred lines; b The growth status of the EC of maize inbred lines 141 and DH3732 at 0 d, 3 d, 6 d, and 9 d\nIn total, the transcriptome sequencing of 48 libraries produced ~\u2009654.72 million clean reads after filtering low-quality reads, adaptor-polluted reads, and high unknown base (N) reads. The number of clean reads ranged from 13,342,096 to 14,067,230 (average\u2009=\u200913,640,022) among the samples. The results of the base composition and quality analysis showed that the clean reads had a good base composition (the T curve was in accordance with the A curve, and the G curve was in accordance with the C curve), and the percentage of low-quality reads was lower than 20% (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figure S1). The B73 genome was used as the reference for read mapping, and HISAT was used to map the reads against the reference. Finally, only 60.73 to 67.38% of the remaining reads could be uniquely mapped onto the reference genome sequence (Table\u00a01).Table 1\nStatistics of all the samples mapped to the reference genome\nTen DEGs involved in different biological processes (photosynthesis, plant hormone signal transduction, and protein phosphorylation) were randomly selected for qRT-PCR to validate the reliability of the transcriptome sequencing data. The results showed that the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients between the data generated from the two platforms were all higher than 0.9 (R2\u2009>\u20090.90) for the three stages (Fig.\u00a02), indicating that the RNA-Seq data were reliable.\n\nFig. 2\nCorrelation of the differential expression ratio between qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq in the three stages\nTo gain insight into the regulatory network of embryonic callus redifferentiation, we analyzed the similarities and differences in the DEGs among the four maize inbred lines. For each line, the common DEGs among all the stages were much higher than the specific DEGs detected by each of the stages (Fig.\u00a03), indicating that only a small number of the DEGs were involved in the early redifferentiation capability of EC. We further focused on the common DEGs shared by the high-regeneration lines (141 and DH40), which showed differential expression patterns in each of the low-regeneration lines (ZYDH381\u20131 and DH3732) during the process of redifferentiation (Fig.\u00a04). These DEGs were accordingly called specific common DEGs in the high-regeneration lines, which were positively correlated with EC regeneration. Conversely, the specific common DEGs in the low-regeneration lines probably exerted inhibitory effects on EC regeneration. Detailed information on these specific common DEGs is shown in Additional\u00a0file\u00a03: Tables S3 and S4. In total, 385 (149 up and 236 down), 436 (199 up and 237 down), and 318 (126 up and 192 down) specific common DEGs were detected at stage I, stage II, and stage III, respectively, amounting to 707 DEGs in the three stages. In contrast, in the low-regeneration lines, a total of 1111 specific common DEGs were identified (Fig. 4). Specifically, 418 (174 up and 244 down), 576 (324 up and 252 down), and 787 (443 up and 344 down) DEGs were expressed at stage I, stage II, and stage III, respectively. According to the adjusted P-value, Zm00001d019518 (Photosystem I reaction center subunit IV A), Zm00001d042178 (Photosystem II reaction center psb28 protein), and Zm00001d039687 (Photosystem I reaction center subunit XI chloroplastic) were the most significant DEGs in 141 and DH40 (Table\u00a02). Conversely, Zm00001d007049 (cysteine proteinases superfamily protein), Zm00001d044122 (dihydroflavonol-4-reductase), and Zm00001d024281 (polyamine oxidase 1) were the most significant DEGs in ZYDH381\u20131 and DH3732 (Table\u00a03).\n\nFig. 3\nVenn diagram of the DEGs for each inbred line\n\n\nFig. 4\nVenn diagram of the DEGs between each inbred line\nTable 2\nThe most differentially expressed specific common DEGs of the two high-regeneration lines\nTable 3\nThe most differentially expressed specific common DEGs of the two low-regeneration lines\nTo assess the expression patterns of these specific common DEGs during early redifferentiation, we conducted a K-means approach using ExpressCluster software, as described in Ge et al. [84]. The expression patterns of the up- or downregulated specific common DEGs were classified into five clusters (Fig.\u00a05). Interestingly, the majority of the clusters in both the high- and low-regeneration lines indicated sharp changes in DEGs at stage I, but more moderate changes at stage II and III, which suggested that stage I played a key role in the regeneration of EC. Somatic embryogenesis, which controls the future morphogenesis of plantlets, mainly occurred at stage I, and thus we supposed that these DEGs were particularly important for embryoid formation. Specifically, the upregulated DEGs in cluster 5 for the high-regeneration lines exhibited a greater change than the other clusters (Additional\u00a0file\u00a04: Table S5), and the majority of these DEGs were related to photosynthesis, such as Zm00001d019518 (photosystem I subunit IV) and Zm00001d042178 (photosystem II 13\u2009kDa protein). Furthermore, the downregulated DEGs in cluster 3 for the high-regeneration lines showed identical and significant declines in stage I (Additional file 4: Table S6), and these DEGs were involved in the cellular protein modification process (Zm00001d042551, integrin-linked kinase), primary metabolic process (Zm00001d008952, endoglucanase; Zm00001d014244, alpha-L-fucosidase), and defense response (Zm00001d034461, indole-3-glycerol-phosphate lyase). For the DEGs in the low-regeneration lines, the upregulated DEGs in cluster 1 continuously increased during the three stages (Additional file 4: Table S7), and most of these genes were related to the metabolic process, such as Zm00001d044122 (dihydroflavonol-4-reductase) and Zm00001d018161 (ferredoxin-nitrite reductase). These downregulated specific common DEGs of cluster 3 displayed consistent expression trends in both the lines, with a sharp reduction in stage I and a slight increase in stage II and III (Additional file 4: Table S8), which included Zm00001d017913 (somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase 1), Zm00001d048647 (transcription factor MYB108-like), and Zm00001d032376 (disease resistance protein RPM1). These DEGs may account for the low regeneration capacity in ZYDH381\u20131 and DH3732.\n\nFig. 5\nThe expression patterns of specific common genes in high (low) regeneration lines\nTo further understand the functional role of the DEGs in the process of EC regeneration, KEGG pathway analysis of the specific common DEGs of 141 and DH40 was conducted (Additional\u00a0file\u00a09: Table S15). In stage I, 66 upregulated DEGs and 85 downregulated DEGs with functional annotations were involved in 40 and 58 metabolic pathways, respectively. In stage II, 91 upregulated DEGs and 87 downregulated DEGs with functional annotations were included in 61 and 51 metabolic pathways, respectively. In stage III, 56 upregulated DEGs and 69 downregulated DEGs with functional annotations affected 44 and 51 metabolic pathways, respectively. Photosynthesis, ribosome, and porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism were three of the most significantly enriched upregulated pathways and were shared by the three stages of EC regeneration, indicating the conserved and important roles of these three metabolic pathways in the process of EC regeneration. Moreover, plant hormone signal transduction was the most significantly enriched pathway for the downregulated DEGs shared by the three stages of EC regeneration, suggesting that the decreased expression of the genes in this pathway positively influences EC regeneration. The significantly enriched pathways for the specific common DEGs of 141 and DH40 in stage I, II, and III samples are listed in Table\u00a04.Table 4\nList of significant enrichment pathways for specific common DEGs of 141 and DH40 (P-value \u22640.05)\nPathways enriched in the specific common DEGs of ZYDH381\u20131 and DH3732 are indicated in Additional\u00a0file\u00a010: Table S16. In stage I, 69 upregulated DEGs and 79 downregulated DEGs were involved in 71 and 62 metabolic pathways, respectively. In stage II, 118 upregulated DEGs and 100 downregulated DEGs were included in 78 and 76 metabolic pathways, respectively. In stage III samples, 178 upregulated DEGs and 112 downregulated affected 90 and 71 metabolic pathways, respectively. For upregulated DEGs, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism was the only significantly enriched pathway that was shared by the three stages of EC regeneration, and nitrogen metabolism was the only enriched pathway shared by stages I and II. In addition, 10 significant enrichment pathways (fatty acid elongation, starch and sucrose metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, glycosaminoglycan degradation, sphingolipid metabolism, galactose metabolism, glycosphingolipid biosynthesis-ganglio series, phenylalanine metabolism, other glycan degradation, and stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid, and gingerol biosynthesis) were shared by stages II and III. Among these, numerous DEGs were involved in the pathway of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, which is the most significant metabolic pathway enriched in stage III. For the downregulated DEGs, seven pathways (plant circadian rhythm, carbon metabolism, valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation, plant hormone signal transduction, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, propanoate metabolism, and cyanoamino acid metabolism) were identified in the three stages of EC regeneration, among which the plant circadian rhythm was the most significant pathway in stages I and II and the second most significant pathway in stage III, whereas plant hormone signal transduction was the most significant pathway in stage III. These significant pathways common to the three stages might have a repressive effect on EC regeneration (Table\u00a05).Table 5\nList of significant enrichment pathways for specific common DEGs of ZYDH381\u20131 and DH3732 (P-value \u22640.05)\nPhotosynthesis mechanism: Photosynthesis is essential for the survival and development of plantlets. According to the functional annotations of the specific common DEGs of 141 and DH40, 14 upregulated genes were involved in the pathway of photosynthesis (Fig.\u00a06a and Additional\u00a0file\u00a012: Figure S5). In addition, 12 genes were involved in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism (Fig. 6a and Additional\u00a0file\u00a013: Figure S6). Moreover, three DEGs including Zm00001d021906, Zm00001d018157, and Zm00001d006587, were involved in the pathway of photosynthetic antenna proteins, all of which were only upregulated in stage I (Fig. 6a and Additional\u00a0file\u00a014: Figure S7). We speculated that photosynthesis could effectively promote the regeneration of embryogenic callus in the two high-regeneration lines.\n\nFig. 6\nRelative expression patterns of the DEGs involved in tissue regeneration. a The relative expression pattern of DEGs involved in photosynthesis mechanism; b The relative expression pattern of DEGs involved in plant circadian rhythm; c The relative expression pattern of DEGs involved in plant hormone signal transduction mechanisms; d The relative expression pattern of DEGs involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis; e The relative expression pattern of DEGs related to cell cycling and WUSCHEL homeobox protein \nIn this study, DESeq2 was used to identify the DEGs between each comparison with a threshold of false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P-value \u22640.05 and FC\u2009\u2265\u20092 (|Log2FC|\u2009\u2265\u20091) [22]. A large number of DEGs were detected at the three stages of EC regeneration for each inbred line in comparison to the control (Fig.\u00a07a). At stage I, there were 1116, 1727, 1059, and 3714 upregulated DEGs and 1578, 2304, 1265, and 3479 downregulated DEGs for lines 141, DH40, ZYDH381\u20131, and DH3732, respectively. For Stage II, there were 1322, 2007, 1182, and 3784 upregulated DEGs and 1367, 2277, 1171, and 2876 downregulated DEGs in 141, DH40, ZYDH381\u20131, and DH3732, respectively. In contrast, in Stage III, 1108, 1563, 1498, and 3779 DEGs showed increased expression for 141, DH40, ZYDH381\u20131, and DH3732, respectively, and 1043, 1668, 1112, and 2999 displayed decreased expression.\n\nFig. 7\nNumbers and transcription levels of DEGs of the four maize inbred lines. a Number of DEGs for each maize. inbred line. b Relative expression levels of the DEGs at the three stages of EC redifferentiation for each maize inbred line.

Brachypodium distachyon is a close relative of wheat and has been described as a new model species for studying of grass functional genomics. Presently, little is known about wheat and B. distachyon Trihelix genes.In 51 species, 2387 Trihelix genes were identified, including 80 wheat Trihelix genes and 27 B. distachyon Trihelix genes. Consistent with the results of previous studies, these genes were classified into five subfamilies: GT-1, GT-2, SIP1, GT\u03b3, and SH4. Members of the same subfamily shared similar gene structures and common motifs. Most TaGT and BdGT genes contained many kinds of cis-elements, such as development-, stress-, and phytohormone-related cis-acting elements. Additionally, 21 randomly selected TaGT genes were mainly expressed in the roots and flowers, while the expression of 19 selected BdGT genes was constitutive. These results indicate that the roles of Trihelix genes in wheat and B. distachyon might have diversified during the evolutionary process. The expression of the most selected TaGT and BdGT genes was down-regulated when exposed to low temperatures, NaCl, ABA, and PEG, implying that TaGT and BdGT genes negatively respond to abiotic stress. On the contrary, the expression of some genes was up-regulated under heat stress.Trihelix genes exist extensively in plants and have many functions. During the evolutionary process, this gene family expanded and their functions diversified. As a result, the expression pattern and functions of members of the same family might be different. This study lays a foundation for further functional analyses of TaGT and BdGT genes.Trihelix transcription factors (TFs), also named GT TFs, contain three tandem helices (helix-loop-helix-loop-helix) [1, 2]. The nomenclature GT originated from the first identified Trihelix gene pea (Pisum sativum) GT-1, which binds specifically to the light-induced gene rbcS-3A [2]. Trihelix genes extensively exist in plants. For example, there are 30 genes in Arabidopsis thaliana [3], 31 in rice [4], 52 in Brassica Rapa [5], 36 in tomato [6] and 20 in Chrysanthemum morifolium [7]. According to their sequence similarities, Trihelix TFs were divided into five clades: GT-1, GT-2, SIP1, GT\u03b3, and SH4 [3].Trihelix genes play extensive roles in plant growth and response to environmental stress. GT-4, a clade member of GT-1 in Arabidopsis, plays an positive role in salt tolerance by directly binding to the Cor15A promoter [8]. Another clade member of GT-1, Solanum habrochaites ShCIGT functions in plant development and response to stress. Transgenic tomato overexpressing ShCIGT exhibited dwarf phenotype and enhanced tolerance to cold and drought [9].Distinct from other GT TFs, clade members of GT-2 have two DNA-binding domains [3]. In Arabidopsis, the GT-2 gene PETAL LOSS (PTL) functions in flower development [10]; GT-2-LIKE1 (GTL1) represses root hair growth [11]; AtGT2L encodes a Ca2+/CaM-binding nuclear transcription factor and is involved in the response to cold and salt [12]. In wheat, TaGT2L1 negatively regulates drought tolerance and stomatal development [13]. In B. distachyon, the transcription factor BdTHX1 likely plays an important role in the biosynthesis of Mixed-linkage glucan (MLG) by regulating the expression of BdCSLF6 (a B. distachyon Cellulose synthase-like gene) and BdXTH8 (a B. distachyon cellulose synthase-like H gene) [14].The first SIP1 member, NtSIP1 (for Nicotiana tabacum 6b\u2013interacting protein 1), was identified in tobacco and seemed to function in the proliferation of plant cells, through association with 6b protein (encoded by the T-DNA of Agrobacterium) [15]. Arabidopsis SIP1 member ASIL1 acts as a temporal regulator of seed filling by repressing the expression of master regulatory genes LEC2, FUS3, ABI3 and other related genes [16]. In Brassica napus, the expression of BnSIP1\u20131 is induced by ABA and abiotic stress. Transgenic Brassica napus lines overexpressing this gene improved the seed germination under osmotic pressure, salt, and ABA treatments [17].Rice genes OsGT\u03b3-1, OsGT\u03b3-2 and OsGT\u03b3-3 were the first clade members of GT\u03b3 to be identified. Expression of OsGT\u03b3-1 is up-regulated under salt stress, with transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsGT\u03b3-1 showing enhanced salinity tolerance [18]. In addition to its role in abiotic stress tolerance, GT\u03b3 also plays important functions in the response to biotic stress. For example, TuGT\u03b3-3 functions in the resistance to stripe rust in Triticum urartu [19].Arabidopsis SH4 gene ASR3 was reported to regulate the expression of genes related to immunity (so called immune genes) [20]. Rice Shattering 1(SHA1) gene plays an important role in cell separation. Mutation in the trihelix domain results in the elimination of seed shattering [21]. Another clade member of SH4, GhGT29 (Gossypium hirsutum) might be involved in the regulation of stress resistance-related genes [22].Common wheat (Triticum aestivum) is an important cereal crop. B. distachyon is a new model species of grass and has a close genetic relationship with common wheat [23]. As genome sequencing of wheat and B. distachyon has been completed [24, 25], it is urgent to elucidate the functions of important genes. However, to date, only the genes TaGT and BdGT have been functionally analyzed [13, 14]. In this study, TaGT and BdGT were analyzed at the genome level. A comparison between Trihelix genes in wheat and B. distachyon was further performed. Our results lay a foundation for further functional elucidation.A total of 80 TaGT and 27 BdGT TFs were identified. Most of them (70 TaGT and 23 BdGT genes) were verified by ESTs (Additional\u00a0files\u00a01 and 2). All predicted wheat Trihelix genes were named from TaGT1-A to TaGT36-D, based on their chromosomal order and genomic homology (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01). BdGT genes were renamed from BdGT1 to BdGT27 based only on their chromosomal order (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02). They were distributed on chromosomes unevenly (Additional\u00a0files\u00a03 and 4). Among 80 TaGT genes, 51 genes constituted 17 sets. Every set included three homologous genes in A, B, and D sub-genomes respectively; other 20 genes formed 10 sets. Every set has homologous genes. The parameters of these GT proteins were predicted. The length of TaGT proteins ranged from 129 (TaGT16-D) to 800 amino acids (TaGT35-D); the PI ranged from 4.8 (TaGT16-D) to 10.39 (TaGT1-A); the molecular weight varied form 1.2 to 85.1\u2009kDa (Additional file 1). In 27 BdGT proteins, the length ranged from 242 (BdGT10) to 875 amino acids (BdGT15); the PI ranged from 5.27 (BdGT14) to 10.05 (BdGT27), and the molecular weight was between 27.6 and 96.6\u2009kDa (Additional file 1). Noticeably, most TaGT and BdGT TFs were hydrophilic proteins (Additional files 1 and 2).To further analyze wheat and B. distachyon Trihelix TFs, multiple sequence alignment was performed. Results showed that GT domains were highly conserved (Additional\u00a0file\u00a05). There were invariant amino acids in the three tandem helices, including tryptophan (W) and leucine (L) in Helix1; tryptophan (W), valine (V) and glycine (G) in Helix2; and glutamine (Q), cysteine (C) and tyrosine (Y) in Helix3 (Additional\u00a0files\u00a05 and 6). In addition, many hydrophobic amino acids (tryptophan, leucine, valine, tyrosine) were found in TaGT and BdGT proteins. Consistent with these results, most TaGT and BdGT TFs were hydrophilic proteins. These hydrophobic amino acids may affect the protein structure and functions [3].Furthermore, we predicted the conserved motifs of TaGT and BdGT proteins. A total of 10 motifs were identified (Figs. 3 and 4). Almost all TaGT proteins had motif 1 and motif 3, except for TaGT1-A (without motif 3) and TaGT16-D (without motif 1). Motif 7 and 10 was only found in some clade members of GT\u03b3 and in some proteins of SH4, respectively. Similarly, motif 1 and motif 3 were identified in all BdGT proteins, while motif 7 and 10 only appeared in BdGT18 which belonged to the subfamily GT\u03b3 and SH4, respectively. These results show that the gene structure and motifs of TaGT and BdGT TFs were conserved. As a result, members with conserved motif compositions and similar gene structures were divided into the same groups. Our phylogenetic analyses results and previous studies clearly showed the reliability of this classification [26, 27].The cis-regulatory elements of promoter regions are related to gene expression patterns and functions [28]. Martin et al. showed that regulatory sequences were located 1500-bp upstream of the start codon [29]. Therefore, we analyzed the 1500-bp promoter region of TaGT and BdGT genes. A total of 249 and 233 kinds of cis-acting elements were detected in TaGT and BdGT gene promoters, respectively. Among them, 216 were identical (Additional\u00a0files\u00a010 and 11).These results further showed that TaGT and BdGT genes were conserved to some extent. Most cis-elements were related to plant growth/development and abiotic stress response (Additional\u00a0file\u00a012). Cis-elements related to growth/development are, among others, associated with light response (SORLIP1AT, GATABOX, GT1CONSENSUS, IBOXCORE, and SORLIP2AT), seed expression (CAATBOX1, EBOXBNNAPA, MYCCONSENSUSAT, and SEF4MOTIFGM7S), leaf expression (DOFCOREZM, GT1CONSENSUS, MYBCORE, MYCCONSENSUSAT and RAV1AAT), shoot expression (GT1 CONSENSUS, MYBCORE, RAV1AAT and IBOX CORE), root expression (RAV1AAT and ROOTMOTIFTAPOX1), pollen expression (GTGANTG10 and POLLEN1LELAT52). Cis-elements related to abiotic stresses are, among others, involved in ABA response (MYCCONSENSUSAT and DPBFCOREDCDC3), gibberellin (GA) response (WRKY71OS), salicylic acid (SA) response (WBOXATNPR1), heat response (CCAATBOX1), salt stress (GT1GMSCAM4), drought response (CBFHV and ACGTATERD), cold response (MYCCONSENSUSAT and CBFHV), oxygen response (CURECORECR and CURECORECR), wounding response (WBOXNTERF3). Trihelix promoters such as GT1GMSCAM4 (pathogen-related), NODCON2GM (root nodules related), WBOXATNPR1 (disease resistance related), and OSE2ROOTNODULE (root nodules related) also contained cis-elements related to biotic stresses. Identification of such high numbers of cis-elements further implies the extensive functions of Trihelix genes.29 cis-elements were found in more than 80% TaGT and BdGT genes (Additional\u00a0file\u00a013). Among them, 6 are involved in light response, 15 are related to plant tissue-specific expression and 13 respond to stress. We also investigated the conservation of cis-elements at the sub-family level. In wheat, clade members of GT-1, GT-2, and SH4 had 9, 2 and 3 of the same cis-elements, respectively and the same 10 cis-elements in all TaGTs (Additional\u00a0file\u00a014). In B. distachyon, members of GT-1, GT\u03b3 and SH4 had corresponding numbers of 7, 3 and 3 of the same cis-elements, respectively, and 8 cis-elements in all BdGTs (Additional\u00a0file\u00a014).In order to predict the functions of TaGT and BdGT proteins, gene ontology (GO) annotation analyses were performed. A total of 19 distinct functional groups were identified: 10 involved in biological processes, 6 involved in cellular components and 3 involved in molecular functions (Additional\u00a0file\u00a015). In wheat, GO classifications of \u2018binding\u2019 (54 proteins, 66.67%), \u2018biological regulation\u2019 (37, 45.68%), \u2018cell\u2019 (30, 37.04%), \u2018cell part\u2019 (30, 37.04%), and \u2018organelle\u2019 (30, 37.04%) were dominantly attributed. Similarly, BdGT proteins were mainly grouped in the GO categories of \u2018binding\u2019 (19 proteins, 70.37%), \u2018biological regulation\u2019 (9, 33.33%), \u2018cell\u2019 (7, 25.93%), \u2018cell part\u2019 (7, 25.93%), and \u2018organelle\u2019 (7, 25.93%). Among these GO categories, TaGT and BdGT genes shared similar proportions of distributions. On one hand, these results indicate the multi-functions of TaGT and BdGT genes; on the other hand, they further suggest functional conservation between TaGT and BdGT TFs.The functional conservation of gene sets was further investigated by comparing both, BdGT18 and BdGT20 gene sets, in detail. A total of 65 and 54 cis-elements were found in BdGT18 and BdGT20, respectively. Among them, 33 were common (Additional\u00a0files\u00a010 and 11). Furthermore, given that the expression pattern between both gene sets was very similar (Figs. 8 and 10). BdGT18 and BdGT20 may share similar functions.To better understand the evolutionary factors that affect the Trihelix gene family, we calculated Ka and Ks ratio between of Trihelix gene pairs. The ratio of most of the tandem and segmental duplications TaGT and BdGT gene pairs, as well as of the orthologous Trihelix gene pairs was less than 1, suggesting that this gene family might have undergone strong purifying selective pressure during evolution in wheat and B. distachyon (Additional files 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28).To analyze expression pattern associated with gene function, we first investigated the temporal and spatial expression patterns of Trihelix genes in wheat and B. distachyon, based on public RNA-sequencing data (Additional\u00a0files\u00a029 and 30). In general, there was no obvious pattern.Previous studies demonstrated that Trihelix genes play extensive roles in plant growth/development and response to abiotic stress. In this study, the expression of most selected BdGT genes was constitutive, implying their multi-functions in growth and development. However, up- and down- regulated expression under different kinds of abiotic stress conditions (Figs 9 and 10) suggest that Trihelix genes also participate in the response to abiotic stress. GO analyses showed that TaGT and BdGT genes are grouped in 19 functional groups, including 10 involved in biological processes, 6 in cellular components and 3 in molecular functions, further indicating the extensive functions of Trihelix genes. Consistent with these results, many cis-elements were detected in promoters of TaGT and BdGT genes (Additional\u00a0files\u00a010 and 11). Most of the cis-elements were involved in plant growth/development and abiotic stress response.Our results imply that the Trihelix gene family expanded during the evolutionary process. The number of genes increased and new subgroups emerged. Undoubtedly, the functions of Trihelix genes are shown to become more extensive with gene expansion.Additionally, the functions of homologous genes might have diversified during the evolutionary process. For example, OsGT\u03b3-1 is mainly expressed in leaves and functions in response to salt stress [18]. There are two homologous genes in wheat (TaGT23 and TaGT31) and B. distachyon (BdGT18 and BdGT20), respectively. Proteins with similarly motif composition were grouped together, despite presenting a different gene structure (OsGT\u03b3-1 has two exons; TaGT23, TaGT31, BdGT18 and BdGT20 only have one exon respectively) (Additional\u00a0file\u00a032).Like OsGT\u03b3-1, three copies of TaGT-23 and TaGT-31 were mainly expressed in leaves. Consistently, TaGT-23 and TaGT-31 share 62 and 64 common cis-elements with rice, respectively. But when treated with salt stress, the expression of TaGT-23 and TaGT31 was down-regulated, while the expression of OsGT\u03b3-1 was up-regulated. Different from OsGT\u03b3-1, the expression of BdGT18 and BdGT20 was constitutive and they were expressed in roots, stems, leaves and flowers at high levels, although they shared 53 and 35 common cis-elements with OsGT\u03b3-1, respectively. However, the expression of BdGT18 and BdGT20 was also down-regulated under salt stress. Such different expression patterns indicate diversified functions.Gene structure of TaGT and BdGT genes was similar within the same subfamilies (Figs. 3 and 4). In the promoters of 80 TaGT genes, 249 kinds of cis-elements were detected (Additional\u00a0file\u00a010); in the promoters of 27 BdGT genes, 233 kinds of cis-elements were detected (Additional\u00a0file\u00a011). Among these cis-elements, 216 are the same. A total of 10 protein motifs were found. Among them, motif 1 and 3 were found in most TaGT and BdGT proteins; motif 7 was present in GT\u03b3 members, while motif 10 was only found in the SH4 subgroup (Figs. 3 and 4). These results are consistent with the fact that wheat and B. distachyon have a close phylogenetic relationship. Furthermore, GO annotations showed that TaGT and BdGT proteins were divided into 19 functional groups (Additional\u00a0file\u00a015). Taken these results together, it is possible to conclude that TaGT and BdGT genes are conserved to some extent.On the other hand, the expression pattern of TaGT genes is quite different from that of BdGT genes. Most TaGT genes are mainly expressed in roots and flowers, while most BdGT genes are expressed constitutively (Figs. 7 and 8). During the evolutionary process, the expression domain of BdGT genes might have extended. As a result, the functions of single BdGT gene might have been more extensive. Furthermore, up- and down- regulated expression of TaGTs and BdGTs under different kinds of abiotic stresses (Figs. 9 and 10), suggest that Trihelix genes participate in plant response to abiotic stress.In this paper, the Trihelix genes were analyzed at the genome level in wheat and B. distachyon. 80 TaGT and 27 BdGT genes were identified. Gene structure, protein motifs, GO analyses, the cis-elements and the expression pattern indicate the conservative and diversified nature of TaGT and BdGT genes.To identify the Trihelix TFs in 51 species, firstly, we used the Hidden Markov Model profile (PF13837) of the Trihelix signature domain downloaded from the Pfam v31.0 database (http://pfam.xfam.org/) to search against plant protein sequences using a threshold of E\u2009<\u20091e\u2212\u20095 [30]. Then, 31 rice and 30 Arabidopsis Trihelix protein sequences were selected to search against protein sequences using a threshold of E\u2009<\u20091e\u2212\u20095 and an identity of 50%. Subsequently, blast and manual corrections were performed to remove alternative events and redundancy. Finally, the NCBI-CDD web server [31] and SMART [32] were used to confirm whether putative Trihelix TFs had conserved GT domains. To further verify the existence of Trihelix genes in wheat and B. distachyon, we performed BLASTN to search for EST using putative Trihelix gene sequences. The MapInspect tool (http://mapinspect.software.informer.com/) was used to map the chromosome location. The ProtParam tool was used to predict physical and chemical properties of TaGT and BdGT TFs [33].To investigate the genetic divergence between each group, we counted the genetic distances based on amino acid sequences using the method of Min Jiang et al. [34]. Full-length Trihelix protein sequences were aligned using the T-COFFEE method [35]. NJ and ML trees were constructed with 1000 bootstrap replicates using MEGA 7 EvolView for tree visualization (http://www.evolgenius.info/evolview/).Gene structures were deduced using GSDS (http://gsds.cbi.pku.edu.cn/). The MEME Suite web server (http://meme-suite.org/) was used to predict the conserved motifs of TaGT and BdGT TFs, with the maximum number and optimum width of motif sets at 10 and 5 to 200 amino acids, respectively [36].The 1500-bp upstream genomic DNA sequences of the wheat and B. distachyon Trihelix genes were submitted to PLANT CARE database (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html/)to predict the cis-acting elements [37]. Gene ontology (GO) annotation of Trihelix proteins was obtained from the PLAZLA3.0 (https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/plaza/versions/plaza_v3_monocots/genome_mapping) to predict the functions of TaGT and BdGT proteins. GO annotation were then plotted using the OmicShare tool (http://www.omicshare.com/tools).Gene duplication analysis of Trihelix genes in different species was performed using the Multiple Collinearity Scan toolkit (MCScanX) with default parameters [38]. The collinear chart of TaGT and BdGT genes was drawn using Circos v0.55 [39]. We plotted the synteny relationship of the Trihelix genes from selected species and calculated the ratio of non-synonymous (ka) to synonymous (ks). Substitutions (Ka/Ks) using the TBtools software (https://github.com/CJ-Chen/TBtools) [40].The wheat cultivar \u2018Chinese Spring\u2019 and B. distachyon Bd-21 were planted in a growth chamber at 23\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u2009\u00b0C with a photoperiod of 16\u2009h /8\u2009h (light/dark). Roots, stems, leaves, and inflorescences were collected at the heading stage. The methods used for abiotic stress treatment, primer design, RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, quantitative RT-PCR were described in a previous study [26]. To explore the expression profiles of GT genes in different tissues and abiotic stress, the FPKM values of expansin genes were obtained from ArrayExpress database under accession number E-MTAB-4401 and E-MTAB-4484, the RNA-seq dataset in the SRA database with accession number SRP045409 and PRJNA360513.Expressed Sequence TagGene OntologyGrand average of hydropathyNon-synonymousSynonymousMaximum LikelihoodNeighbor-joiningIsoelectric PointTranscription factorsThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31571657), and the Open Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas.

Totally, 2387 genes were identified and grouped into GT-1, GT-2, SIP1, GT\u03b3, and SH4 (Additional\u00a0file\u00a07, Fig.\u00a01). Similar to seed plants, some non-seed species had members in all clades GT-1, GT-2, SIP1, GT\u03b3, and SH4, while some algae species only had one or two sub-group genes. For example, Dunaliella salina and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii only had SIP1 clade genes; Coccomyxa subellipsoidea and Micromonas pusilla only had clade members of SIP1 and GT-2. The number of Trihelix genes was greatly variable among 51 plant species, ranging from two to three in algae to 121 in Panicum virgatum. SIP1 is the largest subfamily, and was found in all selected species, whereas the subfamily SH4 appeared latest. These results indicate that the Trihelix gene family is an ancient gene family that might have undergone gene expansion during evolution.\n\nFig. 1\nPhylogenetic relationships between the 51 plant species investigated in this study. The total number of Trihelixs and each groups identified in each plant species was presented on the right\nTo study the evolutionary relationships of Trihelix genes in Gramineae plants, un-rooted Neighbor-joining (NJ) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees were constructed using 249 putative Trihelix proteins of wheat, B. distachyon, maize, rice, sorghum, and barley (Additional\u00a0file\u00a08). Results of these two trees were consistent (Additional\u00a0file\u00a09; Fig. 2).\n\nFig. 2\nPhylogenetic tree of Trihelix proteins. The five different subfamilies were indicated by different colors. Trihelix proteins of TaGT and BdGT TFs were indicated by red and blue circles respectively\nGene structure is helpful to understand the evolution of genes. As shown in Fig.\u00a03, the exon number of TaGT genes ranged from 1 to 8. Except for TaGT22-A and TaGT22-D with two exons, other GT\u03b3 genes only had one exon. In B. distachyon, the exon number of most BdGT genes ranged from 1 to 7. One exception was BdGT16, which had 16 exons. Similar to TaGT genes, BdGT genes in the subfamily GT\u03b3 had one exon (Fig.\u00a04). In general, members of the same family might share similar gene structure.\n\nFig. 3\nGene structures and motifs of TaGT proteins.

In the motif part, the boxes in different color represent different motifs, and the grey lines represent un-conserved sequences\n\n\nFig. 4\nGene structures and motifs of BdGT proteins.

These results were consistent with phylogenetic analyses.\n\nFig. 5\nSchematic representations for the inter-chromosomal relationships of wheat and B. distachyon genes. a Duplicated Trihelix gene pairs in wheat. b Duplicated Trihelix gene pairs in B. distachyon\nIn addition, orthologous between Trihelix genes in wheat, B. distachyon, Arabidopsis thaliana, rice, Hordeum vulgare, Sorghum bicolor, and Zea mays were also investigated. A total of 53, 7, 88, 39, 86 and 154 orthologous Trihelix gene pairs were found between wheat and B. distachyon (Additional\u00a0file\u00a018; Fig.\u00a06a), Arabidopsis thaliana (Additional\u00a0file\u00a019; Fig. 6b), rice (Additional\u00a0file\u00a020; Fig. 6c), Hordeum vulgare (Additional\u00a0file\u00a021; Fig. 6d), Sorghum bicolor (Additional\u00a0file\u00a022; Fig. 6e), Zea mays (Additional\u00a0file\u00a023; Fig. 6f) respectively. Moreover, 3, 25, 14, 21 and 22 orthologous Trihelix gene pairs between B. distachyon and Arabidopsis thaliana (Additional\u00a0file\u00a024; Fig. 6b), rice (Additional\u00a0file\u00a025; Fig. 6c), Hordeum vulgare (Additional\u00a0file\u00a026:; Fig. 6d), Sorghum bicolor (Additional\u00a0file\u00a027; Fig. 6e), and Zea mays (Additional\u00a0file\u00a028; Fig. 6f) were also identified respectively. These results suggested that Trihelix genes of monocot have strong relationships.\n\nFig. 6\nSyntenic relationships between Trihelix genes in different species.

Comparative physical mapping shows the orthologous relationships of BdGT TFs with g Oryza sativa, h Sorghum bicolor and i Zea mays\nFurthermore, we performed qRT-PCR to analyze the expression patterns of 22 and 19 randomly selected TaGT and BdGT genes, respectively (Additional file 31). Briefly, clade members of GT-1, GT-2, SIP1 and SH4 were lowly expressed in stems and leaves, and highly expressed in roots and flowers (Fig.\u00a07). GT\u03b3 genes were highly expressed in leaves. Different from the expression patterns of TaGT genes, the expression of BdSIP1 and BdGT\u03b3 genes was constitutive (Fig.\u00a08). The expression of BdGT-2 and BdSH4 genes was similar to that of TaGT-2 and TaSH4 genes. The expression of different GT-1 genes showed relatively similarities. These results suggest that the functions of BdGT genes diversified and became more extensive during the evolutionary process. We also detected the expression of selected genes under different conditions of abiotic stress. Although, for most of the genes the expression was down-regulated under different abiotic stress conditions, for 11 genes (TaGT6-B, TaGT6-D, TaGT13-B, TaGT17, TaGT26-B, BdGT17, BdGT18, BdGT22, BdGT24, BdGT26, BdGT27) the expression was up-regulated under heat treatment (Figs. 9 and 10).\n\nFig. 7\nExpression profiles of TaGTs in different tissue (R, roots; S, stems; L, leaves; F, flowers)\n\n\nFig. 8\nExpression profiles of BdGTs in different tissues (R, roots; S, stems; L, leaves; F, flower\n\n\nFig. 9\nThe expression level of TaGTs under different abiotic stresses\n\n\nFig. 10\nThe expression level of BdGTs under different abiotic stresses\n\n\nAdditional file 1:\nThe detailed information of TaGT genes.

The objectives of this study were: 1) to perform genome wide association analyses for Warner-Bratzler Shear Force (WBSF), marbling, cooking loss, tenderness, juiciness, connective tissue and flavor; 2) to determine enriched pathways present in each genome wide association analysis; and 3) to identify potential candidate genes with multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with meat quality.The WBSF, marbling and cooking loss traits were measured in longissimus dorsi muscle from 672 steers. Out of these, 495 animals were used to measure tenderness, juiciness, connective tissue and flavor by a sensory panel. All animals were genotyped for 221,077 markers and included in a genome wide association analysis. A total number of 68 genomic regions covering 52 genes were identified using the whole genome association approach; 48% of these genes encode transmembrane proteins or membrane associated molecules. Two enrichment analysis were performed: a tissue restricted gene enrichment applying a correlation analysis between raw associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by trait, and a functional classification analysis performed using the DAVID Bioinformatic Resources 6.8 server. The tissue restricted gene enrichment approach identified eleven pathways including \u201cEndoplasmic reticulum membrane\u201d that influenced multiple traits simultaneously. The DAVID functional classification analysis uncovered eleven clusters related to transmembrane or structural proteins. A gene network was constructed where the number of raw associated uncorrelated SNPs for each gene across all traits was used as a weight. A multiple SNP association analysis was performed for the top five most connected genes in the gene-trait network. The gene network identified the EVC2, ANXA10 and PKHD1 genes as potentially harboring multiple QTLs. Polymorphisms identified in structural proteins can modulate two different processes with direct effect on meat quality: in vivo myocyte cytoskeletal organization and postmortem proteolysis.The main result from the present analysis is the uncovering of several candidate genes associated with meat quality that have structural function in the skeletal muscle.Beef consumers are highly interested in meat quality which is a complex of traits including tenderness, juiciness and flavor [1\u20133]. To respond to consumer demand, beef producers and retailers are interested in providing a consistent high-quality product [4] which requires a reliable and efficient method of measuring the quality of the final product. Beef quality grade is used to categorize carcasses and communicate the quality to consumers. Quality grade is determined predominantly by marbling; however, marbling only explains 5% of the variation in product palatability across carcasses [5]. Marbling and WBSF were identified from an extensive set of carcass and meat composition traits to be the best predictors of eating quality [6]. All the components defining the meat quality complex are quantitative traits, controlled by many genes and impacted by environmental factors. Most of these component traits are difficult and expensive to measure and not available to measure until late in life or after the animal has been harvested. Such traits are impractical to improve through traditional phenotypic selection but are ideal candidates for genomic selection if genetic markers that account for a worthwhile proportion of the phenotypic variation can be identified.Genome wide association (GWA) studies have revealed well-supported associations, but these analyses generally explain only a small proportion of the phenotypic variance [7] because they can only identify genetic variants with medium to large effect. McClure et al. (2012) [8] analyzed five Bos taurus breeds and reported that only 1.02 and 1.85% of the observed phenotypic variation in WBSF could be explained by variation in calpastatin and \u03bc-calpain genes, respectively, two major genes extensively analyzed in relationships with tenderness. Additional approaches, such as gene enrichment, have been designed to help identify genes with small to medium effect in an effort to understand the genetic basis of complex traits like beef palatability and meat quality [9]. The objectives of this study were: 1) to perform a GWA analysis for WBSF, marbling, cooking loss, tenderness, juiciness, connective tissue and flavor; 2) to determine enriched pathways in each GWA analysis; and 3) to identify candidate genes with multiple QTLs associated with meat quality.Twenty-one genes were identified through the functional classification analysis based on DAVID in at least four traits (Fig. 3e and Additional\u00a0file\u00a04). Many of these genes, such as EPHA7, NRXN2, CADM1, PALLD, and VCAN, encode integral components of membranes, or are protein extracellular matrix constituents.The average marbling score was 425.57\u2009\u00b1\u200990.03 which is comparable to the national beef industry average quality [12] and similar to previously reported data in this multibreed population [10, 13, 14]. Based on the taste panel measurements, steaks were classified on average as slightly tender and slightly juicy. Flavor was moderately intense and only traces of connective tissue were perceived by panelists during the sensory panel.Four chromosomal regions were associated with WBSF and harbored the RWDD4A, NUMBL, BLMH, SMG6 and LRP5 genes. The LRP5 is a cell-surface co-receptor of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and has a pivotal role in bone formation. Polymorphisms in LRP5 can modulate the relationship between physical activity and bone density suggesting that LRP5 may play a role in bone mechanical load adaptation. Thus, LRP5 could be involved in bone/muscle cross-talk through the Wnt signaling [15]. Basic and clinical research on bone metabolism and muscle biology suggests that bone interacts with skeletal muscle via signaling from local and humoral factors [16]. A chromosomic region harboring LRP5 was associated with fatty acid composition and WBSF in longissimus muscle from Bos taurus [17, 18].A number of studies have reported associations of polymorphisms in \u03bc-calpain and calpastatin with tenderness, and several of these polymorphisms had a large effect in Bos taurus populations [8, 18\u201320]. In the present study, no association was found between meat quality related traits and \u03bc-calpain or calpastatin, which could be explained by the Bos indicus influence [21]. This reconfirms that genetic markers discovered in Bos taurus populations are usually not predictive in Bos indicus populations most likely due to changes in size effect and stringent p-value corrections applied in GWA approaches. In the same population used in this study, Leal-Guti\u00e9rrez et al. [22] reported multiple polymorphisms in the 3\u2032 region of calpastatin associated with WBSF, however, none of them had a large individual effect. Additionally, in the same population, Wright et al. [23] found that \u03bc-calpain autolysis was related to troponin-T, desmin, and titin degradation, and these were related to variation in WBSF and taste panel tenderness.Three genomic regions (2:7,343,971 \u2013 7,437,564, 5:47,654,327 \u2013 47,827,349, 11:27,755,975 \u2013 27,894,797, and 19:56,569,168 \u2013 56,584,509) had at least two SNPs associated with marbling. The COL3A1 gene located on BTA2 encodes a collagen protein that is more abundant in soft connective tissues [24]. Higher fat and collagen deposition in skeletal muscle is observed in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients, and it has been suggested that a common mesenchymal progenitor cell is responsible for fat and fibrosis accumulation in skeletal muscle. This relationship between fat and fibrosis accumulation could impact meat quality perception. However, it is unclear how adipocytes or collagen-producing cells are regulated before differentiation from mesenchymal progenitors [25]. Other previously reported genes of this family associated with marbling are: COL11A1, COL15A1, COL1A1, COL24A1, COL28A, COL2A1, COL4A3, COL6A3 and COL23A1 [19, 21].Four genes (GRIP1, HELB, FAU and IRAK3) are located on BTA5 between 47,654,327 \u2013 47,827,349. With the exception of FAU, all other genes had at least one SNP associated with marbling. The GRIP1 is a steroid receptor coactivator involved in nuclear receptor-mediated activation of transcription. It activates myogenin, MEF-2, p21, and also promotes expression of contractile proteins and myotube formation. Thus, GRIP1 is involved in myocyte differentiation [26\u201328]. The HELB encodes a 5\u20133 DNA Helicase important for DNA damage response [29]. The SRBD1 and ENSBTAG00000032651 genes are located inside the 11:27,755,975 \u2013 27,894,797 chromosomic region which has two associated SNPs. No conclusive biological support for this association was evident; nevertheless, neighboring regions have been previously reported as associated with fatty acid composition in longissimus muscle from Bos taurus and Bos indicus cattle [17, 30].One region on BTA19 harboring RECQL5, SMIM5 and ENSBTAG00000011713 genes was associated with marbling. The RECQL5 is involved in DNA replication, transcription and repair. The role of RECQL5 in transcription has been related to inhibition of stalled transcript elongation at damaged DNA sites by binding to the RNA polymerase II [31]. The SMIM5 and ENSBTAG00000011713 encode structural proteins in skeletal muscle. This region in the BTA19 has been previously reported as associated with carcass and meat quality, fatty acid composition, and mineral and peptide content [17, 18].A genomic region on BTA5 (105,049,390 - 105,291,830) showed a highly significant association with cooking loss. Two SNPs in this region were significant at the genome wide p-value threshold, while other five SNPs were significant at the 0.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2212\u20093 threshold. Two genes are located in this region: ANO2 and NTF3 (Fig.\u00a01). The ANO2 is an intracellular calcium activated chloride channel [32]. The NTF3 belongs to the Neurotrophic Factor family which modulates survival and function by innervating motoneurons and proprioceptive neurons. The Neurotrophic Factor family is also involved in myoblast and muscle fiber development and differentiation, muscle innervation coordination and functional differentiation of neuromuscular junctions [33]. Mice lacking one NTF3 functional gene copy had smaller cross-sectional fiber area, and fibers were more densely packed than in the wild type phenotype. Adult NTF3 deficient mice showed weaker movement compared to wild type when exposed to electrical stimulation [34]. These results indicate that NTF3 is involved in nerve terminal maturation and synaptic vesicle recycling, and changes to these processes can lead to changes in muscle fiber diameter. The Additional\u00a0file\u00a05 shows the ANO2-NTF3 region in detail and the SNPs associated with cooking loss. Although the associated SNPs are evenly distributed outside and inside several LD-blocks, they are highly correlated, as shown on the SNP correlation heat map. The distribution of these SNPs suggests the presence of a single, unique QTL for cooking loss located downstream from ANO2. When the most significant SNP in this region, rs137723969, was fitted as a fixed effect in the GWA analysis, all remaining SNPs inside this region lost their significance. The rs137723969 SNP is a T/C intronic substitution, thus, it could have a regulatory function or it might be in strong LD with the functional polymorphism.Two other genomic regions on BTA 4 and BTA 13 were associated with cooking loss. The BTA 4 region 40,441,870 - 40,454,953 had two associated SNPs located in the ENSBTAG00000047646 gene. This gene is the bovine orthologue of the human CD36. The CD36 is a multifunctional glycoprotein, and its molecular function is to be a receptor for a broad range of ligands, from fibronectin and collagen to low-density lipoprotein, anionic phospholipids, and long-chain fatty acids [35]. The CD36 regulates plasma membrane fatty acid transport and has been found responsible for an increased passage of fatty acids in obese and insulin resistant people. This higher rate of transport contributes to the increased accumulation rates of triacylglycerol in skeletal muscle through a critical role in regulation of fatty acid esterification and oxidation performed by CD36 [36]. The association of this region with cooking loss could be related to changes in fatty acid deposition and/or composition and its loss as fluid during cooking. Mateescu, Garrick, & Reecy [18] reported association of a region located 0.6 megabases downstream of CD36 with a panel of carcass and meat quality traits, mineral and peptide content and fatty acid composition. The second region is located between 13:60,209,040 and 13:60,210,256, and three associated SNPs are located inside the SIRPD; however, no conclusive biological support was evident.The CHSY3 and PREX2 genes were also found associated with cooking loss. The former gene encodes a transmembrane protein associated to the Golgi apparatus. Dang et al. [37] and Chen et al. [17] found association of chromosomic regions close to CHSY3 and PREX2 with tenderness and fatty acid content in Bos taurus, respectively.Four genes (CFAP54, GPR98, TUT1 and SLC47A1) were associated with sensory tenderness. The CFAP54 and GPR98 are integral components of structural proteins and membranes. The GPR98 has been associated with bone density, levels of serum osteocalcin, bone formation marker, and urine deoxypyridinoline in human and confirmed in mice [38]. Some GPR98 neighboring regions have been reported as associated with multiple carcass and meat quality traits, and fatty acids composition. The biological function of TUT1 is related to synthesis of the 3-poly(A) tail and 3\u2019end cleavage of specific pre-mRNAs, and this region has been reported as associated with fatty acid composition [17, 39].One marker located at 28:41,901,391 and mapped to the MMRN2 gene was highly associated with juiciness. This gene encodes an extracellular matrix glycoprotein, and although its biological role has remained elusive, it is believed to be a key component in endothelial cell function regulation, neoangiogenesis and tumor growth [40]. Chen et al. [17] and Castro et al. [41] reported association of neighboring regions to MMRN2 with fatty acid composition and WBSF in longissimus muscle from Bos taurus and Bos indicus.Four SNPs in regions 45,889,900 \u2013 45,964,845 and 47,514,682 \u2013 47,523,394 on BTA19 were associated with juiciness. The ENSBTAG00000044940 and GOSR2 genes are located inside the first region while METTL2 gene is located inside the second. The GOSR2 gene is involved in the transport of critical membrane glycoprotein complexes in myocytes [42]. In humans, double Gly144Trp mutants in GOSR2 had progressive cortical myoclonus and ataxia with areflexia, showing reduced motor unit recruitment given chronic partial denervation [43]. A GOSR2 neighboring region has been reported as associated with oleic acid content in Japanese Black cattle [44]. One exonic SNP in LIG1 was found associated with juiciness, and a window including this region has been previously reported as associated with WBSF [8].One region on BTA18 was associated with the connective tissue amount, and this region harbors CNOT3, OSCAR and NLRP5 genes. The CNOT3 is a component of the CCR4-NOT complex. This complex codes for major mRNA deadenylases, and it is linked to numerous cellular processes such as miRNA-mediated repression, bulk mRNA degradation, general transcription regulation and translational repression during translational initiation [45]. Morita et al. [46] documented that expression of two CNOT3 regulated genes, PDK4 and IGFBP1, are increased in Cnot3+/\u2212 hepatocytes since they have longer poly(A) tails than those seen in the control. Additionally, the increased expression of CNOT3 target genes was associated with greatly decreased visceral and subcutaneous fat deposition in Cnot3+/\u2212 mice. The OSCAR is an osteoclastogenesis regulator and plays an important bone-specific function in osteoclast differentiation [47]. The ATRNL1 and NFIB were found associated with connective tissue, and Chen et al. [17] and Saatchi et al. [48] reported association of a chromosomic region close to these genes with fatty acid composition in Bos taurus cattle.Flavor had three associated SNPs in MARCO, ZMYND8 and ACCN1. The ZMYND8 may act as a transcriptional corepressor of the KDM5D, and since KDM5D is a histone demethylase that specifically demethylates Lys-4 of histone H3, ZMYND8 plays a central role in histone modifications [49]. Chen et al. [17] reported association of a 0.4 megabases downstream region of the ACCN1 associated SNP with fatty acid composition in Bos taurus; nevertheless, no biological support for this association was found.The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane pathway was enriched for WBSF, cooking loss, tenderness, juiciness, and connective tissue. Figure\u00a03a shows the number of genes in each enriched pathway for each trait. Five genes (SEC16B, REEP1, SLC8A3, TMEM147 and CD4) were identified in the ER membrane pathway for at least three traits simultaneously. The SEC16B is required for secretory cargo traffic from the ER to the Golgi apparatus and for normal transitional ER organization [50]. The REEP1 gene encodes a transmembrane protein required by ER-cytoskeleton network formation, shaping and remodeling [51]. The electrogenic exchange of Ca(2+) against Na(+) ions across the cell membrane is performed by SLC8A3 and contributes to the cytoplasmic regulation of Ca(2+) levels, Ca(2+)-dependent cellular processes and to cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis in excitable cells such as myocytes. The SLC8A3 gene was included in the \u201ctransmembrane signaling receptor activity\u201d and \u201cextracellular matrix structural constituent\u201d GO terms [52, 53].Many proteins in this pathway are structural constituents of the ER, and their implication in meat quality could be hypothesized through changes in ER macrostructure and cytoskeletal binding. Some human hereditary spastic paraplegias result from mutations in REEP1 which is required for ER network formation [51]. The REEP1 is structurally related to the DP1/Yop1p family of ER-shaping proteins, and it colocalizes and forms protein complexes with spastin and atlastin-1. Hydrophobic residues in REEP are critical in supporting membrane curvature [54]. A mutant REEP1 protein lacking the C-terminal cytoplasmic region, disrupts the ER network in vitro, demonstrating that REEP1 binds to microtubules and aligns along the microtubule cytoskeleton [51]. Overexpression of REEP1 dramatically alters ER morphology because this protein has ER-shaping and ER-remodeling function by interacting directly with microtubules [51]. The \u201cEndomembrane system\u201d and \u201cGolgi apparatus\u201d GO terms was identified as enriched following a GWA analysis for WBSF in Nelore cattle [41], showing the importance of structural proteins for the cytoskeletal myocyte framework and tenderness. Proteins in this pathway could be related to proteolysis. The tenderization process is determined by the amount of disruption of cytoskeletal proteins such as desmin, metavinculin, nebulin, dystrophin and vinculin by \u03bc-calpain [55\u201358]. Nevertheless, transmembrane proteins such as TMEM147 and CD4 could be membrane anchors of the cytoskeletal proteins to the plasma and organelle membranes, thus their proteolysis may be critical for tenderization. Giving that REEP1 is not a \u03bc-calpain substrate (Additional\u00a0file\u00a06), this protein may be important for cellular compartmentalization or increased cytoskeletal stability after aging.The ZMYND11, PDE2A, GLIS2, GLI2, and HMGA2 genes from the \u201cnegative regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter\u201d pathway were enriched for connective tissue and marbling. Three genes (CDH13, NKX3\u20131, and PARK2) from the \u201cpositive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter\u201d pathway were also identified as enriched for connective tissue and flavor simultaneously (Fig. 3b and d). The ZMYND11 is a chromatin reader, and it specifically recognizes and binds to histone 3. It regulates RNA polymerase II elongation and colocalizes with highly expressed genes acting as a transcription corepressor by restraining RNA polymerase II at the elongation stage [59]. The PDE2A has phosphodiesterase activity, and it is involved in cAMP (cyclic adenosine 3\u2032:5\u2032-monophosphate) catabolism and signal transduction [60]. The GLIS2 and GLI2 are hedgehog signaling pathway regulators, and HMGA2 modulates transcriptional processes and plays a role in postnatal myogenesis and satellite cell activation [61]. The CDH13 encodes a protein localized to the surface of the cell membrane, and it is hypermethylated in some types of cancer, the NKX3\u20131 transcription factor behaves as a repressor, and PARK2 protein can repress p53/TP53 protecting against apoptosis [62].The relation of these two pathways with meat quality traits can be explained through changes in the expression of genes related to connective and adipose tissue deposition. A nephronophthisis-like phenotype in human and mice was found associated with a mutation in the GLIS2 gene [63], with severe renal fibrosis and atrophy resulting from upregulation of fibrosis related genes and increased apoptosis in the GLIS2 mutant kidneys. Overexpression of HMGA2 has been found in activated myosatellite cells; however, gene expression declines significantly as fusion of myoblasts into myotubes proceeds and also during muscle regeneration [64, 65]. It has been documented that HMGA2 is located inside a QTL for lean mass percentage, growth and back fat in longissimus muscle from swine [66].The ERAL1, GMPPB and LRRK2 genes were enriched in the GTP binding pathway for cooking loss and marbling (Fig. 3c). The ERAL1 encodes a GTPase involved protein required for assembly of the mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit. The LRRK2 has GTPase activity [67]. Some dominant mutations in the human GMPPB associated with defects in protein glycosylation have been identified [68]. These defects result in morphological changes in the neuronal membrane, and dystrophic changes are evident with ring fibers, increased fibrosis, necrosis, and multiple regenerating fibers and abnormal neuromuscular transmission in muscle. Some of these mutations lead to abnormal GMPPB folding, which results in cytoplasm protein aggregates [69]. An associated cluster of GDP (Guanosine-5\u2032-diphosphate)-GTP (Guanosine-5\u2032-triphosphate) conversion related genes on BTA5 and \u201cGTPase binding\u201d enrichment have been reported for meat quality in Nelore populations [41, 70].The EPHA7 and NRXN2 genes were found across all five phenotypes and are expressed in bovine skeletal muscle. The EPHA7 encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor involved in cell signaling and modulation of cell-cell adhesion [71]. Vickerman et al. and Lai et al. [72, 73] showed that EPHA7 is co-localized at the neuromuscular junction of adult muscle being physically associated with the actin cytoskeleton. Changes in NRXN2 expression in motor neurons have been reported as the cause of spinal muscular atrophy in mammals [74]. Only four genes in the ER membrane pathway were found in common between the tissue restricted gene enrichment analysis and the DAVID functional classification analysis (TYRO3, BCL2, POMGNT2 and PTGS1). The TYRO3 is an integral component of plasma membrane, ER membrane and nucleus. The BCL2 is not a membrane bound protein but it is found in mitochondrion and ER. Both TYRO3 and BCL2 are involved in cell survival and apoptosis. The POMGNT2 protein is an integral component of the ER membrane with transferase activity.The EVC2 gene had the highest connectivity in the network. Additional\u00a0file\u00a07 shows the SNP association plot and the LD-block prediction for this gene. The EVC2 encodes a positive regulator of the hedgehog signaling pathway, and it has a critical role in skeletal development and bone formation [75]. Hedgehog signaling modulates patterning and morphogenesis of most organs in mammalian embryo, and mutations in EVC or EVC2 disrupt the hedgehog signaling in bone development, with a high proportion of Ellis-van Creveld syndrome patients presenting mutations in EVC2 [76]. Tenderness, cooking loss and juiciness had two, three and three raw associated uncorrelated SNPs in EVC2, respectively. When fitted together in the association model, only one SNP was significant for tenderness, two for cooking loss (rs455584405 and rs43488309) and other two SNPs (rs43488309 and rs383679972) for juiciness (Additional\u00a0files\u00a07 and 8). The LD-block prediction for EVC2 revealed that these pairs of SNPs significant for each trait were located in different LD-blocks. This suggests that different segments of EVC2 contribute independently to the phenotypic variability present in cooking loss and juiciness in the present population.The bioinformatic analysis of these SNPs revealed that the C allele of rs455584405 reduces the Minimum Free Energy (MFE) parameter by 4.1\u2009kcal/mol, which was the largest impact on MFE from the entire set of SNPs. The missense rs455584405 SNP produces a E6D change in the EVC2 protein. The EVC2 is a transmembrane protein, with a cytoplasmic portion encoded by the 1 to 196 amino acids, the transmembrane portion located between the amino acids 197 and 221, and the remaining representing the extracellular region. No signal peptide was predicted for this protein and the E6D change does not have an effect on the EVC2 isoelectric point. Thus, a possible change in the interaction between the cytoplasmic portion of EVC2 and other cytoskeletal compounds could explain this association. The rs43488309 marker is a synonymous SNP, and the C\u2009>\u2009T change produces a reduction of 3.2\u2009kcal/mol in MFE and minimal changes in mRNA folding.The ANXA10 and PALLD are contiguous genes located on BTA8 (Additional\u00a0file\u00a09). ANXA10, a constituent of the multigene Annexins family, is a Ca2\u2009+\u2009\u2212regulated phospholipid- and membrane-binding protein. This family has been described as involved in diverse biological mechanisms from the control of membrane structure to certain membrane transport processes [77]. The PALLD gene encodes a cytoskeletal protein essential for normal cytoskeletal organization and involved in establishing cell morphology, cell adhesion and motility, and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. PALLD functions as a scaffolding molecule affecting actin polymerization and actin filament assembly [78]. ANXA10 showed a higher LD level that the PALLD locus. This might suggest that more markers are required to map QTLs in PALLD. A total of seven SNPs in ANXA10 were identified as raw associated uncorrelated SNPs for WBSF (2 SNPs), marbling (2 SNPs) and cooking loss (3 SNPs). However, only two SNPs for WBSF, and only one SNP for marbling and cooking loss are required to explain all the variability in the ANXA10-PALLD region. The two indels (rs110953884 SNP and rs464042833) significant for WBSF are located in intronic regions of ANXA10; thus, they could map neighboring functional polymorphisms or have a regulatory function in this gene.The PKHD1 gene (Additional\u00a0file\u00a010) encodes a membrane and cytoskeleton associated binding protein related to the \u201cpositive regulation of cell proliferation\u201d and \u201csingle organismal cell-cell adhesion\u201d pathways. Several phenotypes are associated with mutations in PKHD1: congenital hepatic fibrosis, biliary tract abnormality and absence of renal corticomedullary differentiation [79\u201381]. Although this gene has not been associated with any skeletal muscle related phenotype, it is expressed at a low level in skeletal muscle [82]. The PKHD1 locus is in a low LD region with the possibility of multiple QTLs. All three raw uncorrelated SNPs associated with WBSF were significant when fitted simultaneously, as was the case with the two significant SNPs for flavor. The existence of several associated SNPs in different LD-blocks of PKHD1 indicate that different regions of this gene could contribute independently to tenderness and flavor in the present population.The PKHD1 protein contains an intracellular segment (3873\u20134071 amino acids), a transmembrane segment between 3850 and 3872, and an extracellular segment. The bioinformatics analysis predicted a signal peptide between amino acids 1\u201317. Three SNPs (rs43559996, rs209661307 and rs714029807) were significant when fitted simultaneously for tenderness, while two other SNPs (rs208145052 and rs718439487) were significant for flavor. The bioinformatic analysis identified only 2 of these SNPs (rs43559996 and rs209661307) as able to modify the MFE parameter (by 3.4 and 1.3\u2009kcal/mol, respectively) and have the biggest impact on mRNA folding. All five SNPs are missense polymorphisms (Additional\u00a0file\u00a08), and they are able to change the isoelectric point parameter by 0.01. The rs714029807, rs718439487, rs208145052, rs209661307 SNPs are located in the extracellular segment of PKHD1 and rs43559996 is found in the cytoplasmic portion. Thus, all these SNPs might affect the physical relationship between PKHD1 and the extracellular matrix and other cytoskeletal proteins.ENSBTAG00000020151 gene codes for a protein with nucleic acid binding activity [83] (Additional\u00a0file\u00a011), but its specific function has not been clearly identified. Two associated uncorrelated SNPs associated with marbling are located inside the first LD block; however, only one is able to explain all the variability present in this region when both are fitted simultaneously in the model. Two uncorrelated SNPs in this gene were found associated with cooking loss and flavor but in both cases one SNP is able to explain all the variability present in each trait.Multiple myocyte structural proteins and related pathways were identified in the present analysis. From the 52 genes identified in the GWA approach, 48% encode transmembrane proteins or membrane associated molecules and 5.7% encode cytoskeletal proteins. Genes in the Endoplasmic reticulum membrane, Golgi apparatus, GTP binding and Mitochondrial inner membrane were enriched, and clustering of the same type of proteins was evident using the functional classification analysis. Polymorphisms in genes coding for structural proteins can modulate two different processes with direct effect on meat quality: in vivo myocyte cytoskeletal organization and postmortem proteolysis.From the genes associated with the in vivo myocyte cytoskeletal organization, EHD, BNIP3, MARCO and COL5A1 are the most interesting and are discussed further. The EHD gene is involved in receptor and lipid recycling in plasma membrane and promotes cytoskeletal reorganization and tubule formation; EHD also physically interacts with myoferlin, a protein involved in myoblast fusion [84]. The myoblasts of the EHD1 knockout mice showed impaired receptor recycling and key muscle protein misplacement [84], resulting in muscles with reduced myoblast fusion, smaller myofibers and overgrown T-tubules. Defective EHD1 adipocytes have enlarged endosomes and cytoplasmic dispersion of perinuclear GLUT4-containing membranes [85]. It was reported that EHD1 regulates transport of \u03b21-integrin, a protein involved in multiple signaling pathways and a key for processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, cell spreading and migration [86]. EHD1 knockdown produces impaired \u03b21-integrin recycling and accumulation in a transferrin-containing endocytic recycling compartment. Fibroblastic plasma membranes from EHD1 knockouts had lower content of \u03b21-integrin, more prominent focal adhesions, and diminished migration and cell spreading capacity. Activation and upregulation of the MARCO gene is associated with changes in actin cytoskeleton organization during cellular splenic maturation. Immature splenic dendritic cells are adherent and show visible actin structures while mature cells are nonadherent, round and have punctate actin cytoskeletal structure [87]. The BNIP3 modulates actin cytoskeleton plasticity and knockdown of this gene results in a more stable tubular-like network, different actin cytoskeletal remodeling activity, upregulated formation of actin stress fibers, decreased lamellopodial protrusions and filopodia [88]. In wild type fibroblasts, COLLV and COLLIII are arranged as large fibrils in the intercellular spaces but mutations in COL5A1 and COL3A1 alter collagen organization in the extracellular matrix and affect clustering of \u03b12\u03b21 integrin receptor. Mutations in COL5A1 and COL3A1 also promote collagen retention in the cytoplasm [89].Polymorphisms in other structural proteins are associated with functional alterations. Yadav et al. [90] reported that four mutations in GLUR\u03941 trigger spontaneous gate opening. Mutations in C19ORF12 gene modifies protein location and function; C19ORF12 encodes a protein located in the mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum membrane and mutations in this gene impair protein subcellular location and cellular response to oxidative stress [91]. Activating mutations in PDGFRA have been identified in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Mutations in the PDGFRA transmembrane domain simulates dimer transmembrane domain packing and promotes cell growth and signaling in the absence of ligand [92].The second mechanism is associated with the amount of structural protein disruption in the myocyte after aging. Meat quality is mainly determined by the extent of postmortem proteolysis of key cytoskeletal, cytoskeletal-associated proteins, and extracellular matrix-associated proteins. This proteolysis is accomplished by degradation of structural proteins such as desmin and talin during aging through the activity of the endogenous \u03bc-calpain-calpastatin system [93\u201396]. Filaments such as desmin and talin are the main substrates of this endogenous system, but membrane anchoring proteins identified in the present analysis might have a significant contribution. From a total of 72 structural proteins identified as associated with meat quality traits in the present analysis (Additional file 6), 87.5% of these proteins are potential substrates of \u03bc-calpain. Some previously reported membrane associated proteins and calpain substrates are: GIUR1, NR2A, CFTR and ITPR1 [97\u2013101]. Many of these proteins anchor cytoskeletal filaments to the sarcolemma and organelle membranes, therefore the lysis of these proteins during proteolysis could have a direct effect on overall cytoskeletal stability.A total number of 68 genomic regions covering 52 genes were associated with meat quality traits and these genes are related to gene-expression, cell-signaling, cell-differentiation, and apoptosis; 48% of these genes encode transmembrane proteins or membrane associated molecules and 5.7% encode cytoskeletal proteins. A tissue restricted gene enrichment identified two main kinds of pathways: pathways associated with membrane structural proteins such as Endoplasmic reticulum membrane, Golgi apparatus, GTP binding and Mitochondrial inner membrane, and pathways related to gene expression including Negative regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, Positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, Regulation of transcription, DNA-templated, RNA binding and Transcription DNA-templated. A DAVID functional classification analysis identified clusters mainly related to integral components of membranes. A gene network identified the EVC2, ANXA10 and PKHD1 as potential genes with multiple QTLs associated with meat quality.Polymorphisms in structural proteins can modulate two processes with direct effect on meat quality: in vivo myocyte cytoskeletal organization and postmortem proteolysis. Gene related to the first process such as EHD, BNIP3, MARCO and COL5A1 control cytoskeletal organization and remodeling, T-tubules growth and transport of other transmembrane proteins. During postmortem proteolysis, structural proteins are disrupted in the myocytes. Filaments such as desmin and talin are the main proteolysis substrates, but membrane anchoring proteins identified as associated in the present analysis might have a significant contribution. Out of 72 structural proteins identified as associated with meat quality traits in the present analysis, 87.5% are potential substrates of \u03bc-calpain. Lysis of these proteins during proteolysis could have a direct effect on overall cytoskeletal stability giving that many of these proteins anchor cytoskeletal filaments to the sarcolemma and organelle membranes.The research protocol was approved by the University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee number 201003744. The animals were born between 2007 and 2014 and belong to the multibreed Angus-Brahman herd from the University of Florida [102]. Cattle were classified into six different groups based on their expected Angus and Brahman breed composition. Based on the Angus composition, the grouping was as follows: 1\u2009=\u2009100 to 80%; 2\u2009=\u200979 to 65%; 3\u2009=\u200962.5% (Brangus); 4\u2009=\u200959 to 40%; 5\u2009=\u200939 to 20%; 6\u2009=\u200919 to 0%.When steers reached 1.27\u2009cm subcutaneous fat thickness over the ribeye, they were transported to a commercial packing plant with an average slaughter weight of 537.94\u2009\u00b1\u200955.31\u2009kg at 17.31\u2009\u00b1\u20091.23\u2009months. A total number of 672 steers were harvested using established USDA-FSIS procedures, and after 48\u2009h postmortem, marbling was recorded by graders\u2019 visual appraisal of the ribeye muscle at the cut surface after the carcass had been ribbed at the 12th/13th rib interface. The marbling grade was as follows: Practically Devoid\u2009=\u2009100\u2013199, Traces\u2009=\u2009200\u2013299, Slight\u2009=\u2009300\u2013399, Small\u2009=\u2009400\u2013499, Modest\u2009=\u2009500\u2013599, Moderate\u2009=\u2009600\u2013699, Slightly Abundant\u2009=\u2009700\u2013799, Moderately Abundant\u2009=\u2009800\u2013899, Abundant\u2009=\u2009900\u2013999. A Johnson normalization was applied to marbling [103].Two 2.54\u2009cm steaks from the longissimus dorsi muscle at the 12th/13th rib interface were sampled from each animal. Steaks were transported to the Meat Science Laboratory of the University of Florida, aged for 14\u2009days at 1 to 4\u2009\u00b0C, and then stored at \u2212\u200920\u2009\u00b0C. Both frozen steaks from each animal were allowed to thaw at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 24\u2009h and cooked to an internal temperature of 71\u2009\u00b0C on an open-hearth grill. After cooking, one steak was cooled at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 18 to 24\u2009h and used to measure WBSF and cooking loss according to the American Meat Science Association Sensory Guidelines [104]. Six cores with a 1.27-cm diameter and parallel to the muscle fiber were sheared with a Warner-Bratzler head attached to an Instron Universal Testing Machine (model 3343; Instron Corporation, Canton, MA). The Warner-Bratzler head moved at a cross head speed of 200\u2009mm/min. The average peak load (kg) of six cores from the same steak was calculated and the logarithm of WBSF was subsequently analyzed. The weight lost during cooking was recorded and cooking loss was expressed as a percentage of the cooked weight out of the thaw weight.The second steak was used to measure tenderness, juiciness, connective tissue and flavor by a sensory panel according to the American Meat Science Association Sensory Guidelines [104]. The sensory panel consisted of eight to eleven trained members, and six animals were assessed per session. Two 1\u2009\u00d7\u20092.54\u2009cm samples from each steak were provided to each panelist. Sensory panel measurements analyzed by the sensory panelists included: tenderness (8\u2009=\u2009extremely tender, 7\u2009=\u2009very tender, 6\u2009=\u2009moderately tender, 5\u2009=\u2009slightly tender, 4\u2009=\u2009slightly tough, 3\u2009=\u2009moderately tough, 2\u2009=\u2009very tough, 1\u2009=\u2009extremely tough), juiciness (8\u2009=\u2009extremely juicy, 7\u2009=\u2009very juicy, 6\u2009=\u2009moderately juicy, 5\u2009=\u2009slightly juicy, 4\u2009=\u2009slightly dry, 3\u2009=\u2009moderately dry, 2\u2009=\u2009very dry, 1\u2009=\u2009extremely dry), connective tissue (8\u2009=\u2009none detected, 7\u2009=\u2009practically none, 6\u2009=\u2009traces amount, 5\u2009=\u2009slight amount, 4\u2009=\u2009moderate amount, 3\u2009=\u2009slightly abundant, 2\u2009=\u2009moderately abundant, 1\u2009=\u2009abundant amount), and flavor (8\u2009=\u2009extremely intense, 7\u2009=\u2009very intense, 6\u2009=\u2009moderately intense, 5\u2009=\u2009slightly intense, 4\u2009=\u2009slightly bland, 3\u2009=\u2009moderately bland, 2\u2009=\u2009very bland, 1\u2009=\u2009extremely bland). For each phenotype, the average of scores from all members of the panel was analyzed for each steak. The Johnson normalization was applied to connective tissue [103].Genomic DNA was extracted from blood using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and stored at \u2212\u200920\u2009\u00b0C. All animals were genotyped with the commercial GGP Bovine F-250 chip (GeneSeek, Inc., Lincoln, NE) which contains 221,077 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A total number of 115,287 SNPs were included in the GWAs after excluding markers with a minor allele frequency lower than 0.05 and a calling rate smaller than 0.9. Samples with calling rates smaller than 0.85 were excluded from the association analysis. All quality control was performed with JMP genomics 6.0 software [103].The analysis was performed using the \u201cGenetics Q-K analysis workflow\u201d of JMP-Genomics 6.0 software applying the mixed model K method [105]. The genomic relationship matrix was calculated and included in the analysis as random effect, and the year of birth and SNP were included as fixed effects. Each marker was tested individually. An adjusted genome wide threshold of 0.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2212\u20096 was calculated by the R function \u201csimpleM_Ex\u201d [106, 107] which applied the effective number of independent tests. The Benjamini-Hochberg p-value correction for multiple testing was calculated using the effective number of independent tests. If no SNP reached the genome wide threshold by trait, a secondary arbitrary threshold of 0.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2212\u20093 was used. The R package \u201cCMplot\u201d v3.3.0 [108] was used to graph the p-value distributions.A tissue restricted gene enrichment was performed for each GWA. The methodology described by Baranzini et al. [109] was modified and carried out using in-house JAVA scripts. From each GWA, all SNPs with p-value \u22640.05 were included in the gene enrichment analysis and were defined as \u201craw\u201d associated SNPs. Raw associated SNPs were assigned to genes if they were located inside a gene or within 3 kilobases upstream or downstream from a gene. Gene locations were obtain using Biomart from the Bos taurus UMD 3.1.1 assembly in Ensembl [110, 111]. The tissue restriction was performed by filtering genes expressed in bovine skeletal muscle, based on a list of 10,919 genes reported by the EMBL-EBI Expression Atlas (Additional\u00a0file\u00a012). The list included genes reported as expressed in at least one of the two types of experiments with codes E-MTAB-2798 and E-MTAB-2596. This list was also used as a background list in the tissue restricted gene enrichment analysis. The correlation between the raw associated SNPs within each gene was calculated based on their p-value, and SNPs were considered correlated when r2\u2009>\u2009\u00b10.3. A set of the most significant uncorrelated SNPs for each gene were retained for each gene. When all raw associated SNPs within a gene were correlated, the gene was included only once in the final gene list. Genes with more than one raw associated uncorrelated SNPs were included as many times as the number of uncorrelated SNPs in the final gene list to identify genes with possibly multiple functional polymorphisms. The maximum number of raw associated uncorrelated SNPs for one gene was three (Additional\u00a0file\u00a013).The available GO terms for molecular function, cellular component and biological process were included in the analysis using a GO term estimation for the background list in DAVID Bioinformatic Resources 6.8 server [112]. A total number of 105, 89, 85, 92, 81, 86, and 95 GO terms for WBSF, marbling, cooking loss, tenderness, juiciness, connective tissue, and flavor, respectively, were included (Additional\u00a0file\u00a014). Gene lists with 1714, 1636, 1632, 1753, 1753, 1666, and 1684 genes for WBSF, marbling, cooking loss, tenderness, juiciness, connective tissue, and flavor, respectively, were used (Additional\u00a0file\u00a014). Gene enrichment was calculated using the hypergeometric test available in the Apache Commons Mathematics Library for JAVA [113]. The Benjamini-Hochberg p-value correction was performed for each pathway by trait. The R package \u201climma\u201d [114] was used to visualize gene overlapping between traits if the same pathway was determined as enriched in numerous traits.A second analysis was performed using DAVID Bioinformatic Resources 6.8 server [112]. SNPs with p-value \u22640.05 from each GWA analysis were assigned to genes as described in the tissue restricted gene enrichment. All genes were included in the list only once (Additional\u00a0file\u00a014), regardless of how many uncorrelated associated SNP they contained. A total number of 2762, 2634, 2720, 2788, 2840, 2685, and 2764 genes for WBSF, marbling, cooking loss, tenderness, juiciness, connective tissue, and flavor, respectively, were included in the gene list (Additional file 4). The default DAVID background list was used during the analysis.All gene lists used in the tissue restricted gene enrichment analysis were included in the construction of a gene network represented by a matrix with traits as columns and genes as rows. The weight of each gene for each trait was determined by the number of raw associated uncorrelated SNPs. The R package \u201cigraph\u201d [115] was used to construct the graphical representation of the top 30 most connected genes in the network.The top five genes in the gene network had a significantly higher connectivity than the rest of the genes in the network and were further analyzed as candidate genes with multiple QTLs associated with different meat quality traits. The LD pattern within each candidate genes with multiple QTLs was predicted using 196 families with 569 steers from the present population. LD blocks were constructed using the Haploview software [116] using a confidence interval of minimum 98% for strong LD [117].An association analysis was performed for each one of the top five genes in order to confirm the presence of multiple QTLs. All the raw associated uncorrelated SNPs were fitted simultaneously in an association model. The analysis was performed using the \u201cGenetics Q-K analysis workflow\u201d of JMP-Genomics 6.0 software applying the mixed model K method [105] and the final model included only significant SNPs associated with the phenotype that was being considered.To evaluate the potential effect of missense and synonymous variants identified in these five candidate genes, a bioinformatic analysis was performed. The foldRNA server was used to evaluate the MFE and mRNA structure parameters for each mRNA variant [118]. The Prosite from expasy [119], Phobius [120], TMHMM [121, 122], and SignalP 4.1 [123] servers were used to predict domains, transmembrane regions and signal peptides in each protein, respectively. ComputePI from Expasy [124] was used to calculate the isoelectic point of each protein variant.A protease substrate analysis for each of the structural proteins coded by genes identified in the previous analyses was performed. Genes identified through GWA analysis, either one of the gene enrichment procedures and the gene network analysis were included. Genes identified in at least two traits simultaneously for the tissue restricted gene enrichment and in at least three traits for the DAVID functional classification were analyzed. Only genes expressed in bovine muscle or adipose tissue (experiments with codes E-MTAB-2798 and E-MTAB-2596) based on the expression atlas [125] were included in the analysis. This analysis was carried out using the PROSPER server [126] which reports proteins that are possible substrates of \u03bc-calpain.Bos taurus autosomeCyclic adenosine 3\u2032:5\u2032-monophosphateEndoplasmic reticulumGuanosine-5\u2032-diphosphateGene ontologyGuanosine-5\u2032-triphosphateGenome wide associationLinkage disequilibriumMinimum Free EnergyQuantitative trait lociSingle nucleotide polymorphismsWarner-Bratzler Shear ForceFinancial support provided by Florida Agricultural Experiment Station Hatch FLA-ANS-005548, Florida Beef Council, and Florida Beef Cattle Association \u2013 Beef Enhancement Fund Award 022962.

The estimated heritabilities for marbling, tenderness and WBSF were 0.50\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05, 0.47\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06 and 0.17\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03, respectively, and the additive genetic correlation between WBSF and tenderness was \u2212\u20090.97\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01 [11].

(XLS 534 kb)", "s12864-019-5529-0": "Bioko is one of the few islands that exist around Africa, the most genetically diverse continent on the planet. The native Bantu-speaking inhabitants of Bioko, the Bubi, are believed to have colonized the island about 2000\u2009years ago. Here, we sequenced the genome of thirteen Bubi individuals at high coverage and analysed their sequences in comparison to mainland populations from the Gulf of Guinea.We found that, genetically, the closest mainland population to the Bubi are Bantu-speaking groups from Angola instead the geographically closer groups from Cameroon. The Bubi possess a lower proportion of rainforest hunter-gatherer (RHG) ancestry than most other Bantu-speaking groups. However, their RHG component most likely came from the same source and could have reached them by gene flow from the mainland after island settlement. By studying identity by descent (IBD) genomic blocks and runs of homozygosity (ROHs), we found evidence for a significant level of genetic isolation among the Bubi, isolation that can be attributed to the island effect. Additionally, as this population is known to have one of the highest malaria incidence rates in the world we analysed their genome for malaria-resistant alleles. However, we were unable to detect any specific selective sweeps related to this disease.By describing their dispersal to the Atlantic islands, the genomic characterization of the Bubi contributes to the understanding of the margins of the massive Bantu migration that shaped all Sub-Saharan African populations.The origin of the Bubi people is controversial. Since the British explorer Richard Francis Burton visited the island (then called Fernando Poo) in 1874 [5], ethnographers generally considered the Bubi to be the original settlers of Bioko. However, it is currently accepted that the Bubi agriculturalists arrived from the mainland in dugout canoes about 2000\u2009years ago during the Late Neolithic [6\u20138]. Ever since, the Bubi seem to have been isolated from mainland Bantu-speaking groups [9]. Bubi mythology explains that, upon their arrival to the island, they found other, more robust people living there, a population whom they called Balett\u00e9rimo [1, 9].In fact, some unsystematic archaeological prospects carried out by Spanish scholars have uncovered pre-Neolithic lithic tools of a typology that has been called banapense, although this lithic typology does not currently have a clear chronological framework [9].The expansion of the Bantu-speaking farming communities is probably one of the most important human movements that have taken place in recent African history [10]. This movement started approximately 4000 to 5000\u2009years ago [11], likely from a source close to the present-day North Cameroonian [12] or Gabonese/Angolan Bantu-speaking populations [13], depending on which model \u2013 \u201cearly-split\u201d or \u201clate-split\u201d \u2013 is assumed. While the first model suggests that the Bantus made an early separation into western and eastern branches, the second model supports an initial movement south across the rainforest before splitting into two branches, one headed south and the other east. Whatever the route of dispersal, the Bantu-speaking migration triggered an expansion of agriculture and ironwork along with the spread of Bantu languages (part of the Niger-Congo family) across most of Central, South and East Africa [13\u201316].During their extensive geographical migration, the Bantus encountered and admixed with local rainforest hunter-gatherer (RHG) tribes. Several Bantu-speaking groups have been studied from a genetic point of view over the years, especially using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and Y chromosome markers [12, 17\u201320]. These studies have detected a substantial fraction of Pygmy mtDNA lineages within the Bantu speakers, but rarely the opposite [17, 18]. For example, traces (around 1%) of RHG Y chromosomes have been found in Bantu-speaking groups from Gabon and Cameroon [12] and signals of hunter-gatherer Khoisan Y chromosomes in Bantu-speaking groups from Mozambique [21].Despite these efforts, the genetic patterns of variation within the Bantus remained largely unexplored on a genomic scale until fairly recently [14, 15, 22]. The analysis of a large and geographically diverse dataset of 35 Bantu groups has recently confirmed the existence of this RHG ancestry as well as the acquisition of adaptive alleles from these local populations, especially at the human-leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci. By measuring the length of the introgressed genetic fragments, the admixture between western Bantu-speaking populations and RHG was estimated to occur about 800\u2009years ago, mostly after Bantu-speaking populations began moving throughout Sub-Saharan Africa [13]. According to this study, while the most likely parental source population of Bantu ancestry in both eastern and southern Bantus was located in northern Angola, Bakoya of Gabon and Congo were the best parental source for RHG ancestry. Recent retrieval of ancient genomes from different African localities, notably in the south and the east, could help elucidate these past admixture events [23, 24]. So far, however, no ancient genomes have been retrieved from the Gulf of Guinea.There are hypothesis that could potentially be explored with genome-wide data from the Bubi. First, their relatively long period of isolation on the island is a potential way to test the age and extent of the Bantu admixture with RHG tribes, an event that supposedly took place among the coastal Bantu groups after isolation of Bubi ancestors on the island. Second, studying a tribe from one of the few islands around Africa could provide information about potential effects of endogamy and isolation that are less likely to occur in mainland tribes. Finally, genome-wide data from the Bubi can offer clues regarding the adaptation of this group to local conditions. For example, it is known that the population of Equatorial Guinea has one of the highest levels of malaria infection in the world [25] and ranks 13th in the list of malaria prevalence countries, representing the second highest cause of death in the country [26] Despite prevention efforts carried out since 2004, severe malaria prevalence in Bioko children remains high [27]. Thus, screening potential resistant variants can help us further understand the selective pressures faced by the Bubi during the last few hundred years.We show in this work that the Bantu population of Bioko Island mirrors the genetic makeup of the extant, coastal Bantu-speaking groups, also clarifying the dynamics of this human expansion into the Atlantic islands of Africa.We sequenced 13 Bubi genomes obtaining a depth of coverage up to 21x-32x (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S5). All mtDNA haplogroups present in the Bubi are subclades of the L haplogroup (L1b, L2b, L3e, L3f, and L3e) and are common in other populations from the Gulf of Guinea. All male individuals of this dataset belong to subclades of the E1b1a1 haplogroup, the predominant Y-chromosome lineage in Western, Central and Southern Africa (Additional file 1: Table S6).On a genome-wide scale, the first two components of the principal component analysis (PCA) separate the RHG from the Bantu speakers and the Western Africa non-Bantu populations (Fig. 1c). When PC3 and PC4 are plotted, Bantu-speaking and Western African populations cluster separately (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Figure S1). Three Bubi individuals that we named Bubi-subset1 (BBS014, BBS018, BBS023) fall within the Western Africa cluster showing that some individuals share a larger proportion of Western-Africa ancestry than others, while the rest (named Bubi-subset2) cluster within the Bantu diversity (Additional file 2: Figure S1). To examine if this clustering reveals the presence of population substructure, we have used the USCS liftover [28] to convert the chimpanzee reference sequence (Pan troglodytes 3.0 assembly, GCA_000001515.5) to human coordinates in 546,558 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of our dataset. We have subsequently computed f4 statistics in the form (Bubi-subset1, Bubi-subset2; X, chimpanzee), to examine the homogeneity of the Bubi population (Additional file 2: Figure S2, Additional file 1: Table S7). None of the tested populations showed elevated (|\u2009>\u20093|) values of Z-score; therefore we have treated the Bubi as a single population in subsequent analyses.Furthermore, owing to the colonial history of Bioko we have explored the possibility of some Iberian contribution to the Bubi ancestry by calculating the f3 statistic in the form (Iberia, X; Mbuti). The Bubi are placed within the range of Western African and other Bantu-speaking populations (Additional file 2: Figure S6); therefore, no Iberian genetic affinities can be discerned within the current dataset.To explore possible admixture events that could have led to the origins of the Bubi, we also performed GLOBETROTTER analysis (based on ChromoPainter); however, no admixing events could be identified. We also used fineSTRUCTURE to plot a PCA based on haplotype differentiation. This method clusters the populations into the same groups as those used when considering genotypes. In this analysis, the Bubi present a clear intermediate position between Western African and Bantu-speaking populations (Additional file 2: Figure S9). For computational convenience, we performed these analyses with a restricted dataset.We found that all Bubi individuals possessed the malaria-resistant allele of the ACKR1 [30] and CD36 genes [31], in addition to certain variations in other genes such as G6PD [32], ATP2B4 [33], GRK5 [34], and IL-10 [35]. Moreover, resistant variants are absent in ABO, HBB [36] and TIRAP [37] (Additional file 1: Table S13) [38]. However, considering these mutations are observed at low frequency among other African groups, it is likely they were simply not present in the ancestors of the Bubi (Additional file 1: Table S14). We compared the allelic frequencies of malaria SNPs in the Bubi with those from neighbouring populations of the Gulf of Guinea \u2013 such as Esan, Gambian, Mende, and Yoruba \u2013 for which genome-wide sequence data was available. We found statistically significant (Fisher\u2019s exact test) differences in some alleles, but nothing that indicated a unique trend in the Bubi (Additional file 1: Table S15). We subsequently conducted a genome-wide Fst scan between the Bubi and Yoruba, using all the variable positions with MAF\u2009>\u20090.05 and missing genotypes <\u20090.05, plotting the mean Fst values in 0.5\u2009Mb windows. We set a threshold of significance in 0.25 [39]. We have failed to detect any signal of a selective event, including those regions related to immunity against malaria (Additional file 2: Figure S11).Our genomic study of the population of Bioko Island confirms that the Bantu-speaking migration that shaped most of the present-day human diversity in Sub-Saharan Africa [40] also had a significant impact on African islands of the Gulf of Guinea. The general components of ancestry found in the Bubi are not different from those found in mainland Bantu-speaking groups, although in the case of the Bubi, the RHG ancestry is lower than the amount detected in most Western Bantu-speaking groups. Moreover, we did not detect a significant difference in the origin of the Bubi RHG genetic signal to the one observed in other Bantu populations. One potential explanation could be that an admixture event between the ancestors of the Bubi and the RHG tribes started about 2000\u2009years ago and was brought to the island upon settlement, but continued to increase thereafter in most mainland Bantu-speaking groups. It is worth noting that the time of admixture can be underestimated when using methods based on linkage-disequilibrium decay if continuous admixture events actually occurred [41]. Therefore, the current 800\u2009years estimate [13] could in fact be the end of a long period of gene flow between mainland Bantu-speakers and RHG. This scenario could help explain the clustering of the Bubi with Western African groups in some analyses (the latter groups also show residual or no traces of RHG ancestry).Due to a certain degree of heterogeneity detected within the Bubi that was evident from PCA, ADMIXTURE and fineSTRUCTURE analyses, the possibility that different populations from Bioko could harbour slightly different genetic histories existed. Notably, some Bubi show almost no signs of RHG; interestingly, one of these individuals is from Bariob\u00e9, a relatively isolated province in the mountainous interior of the island. An alternative possibility could be that the small fraction of RHG ancestry was acquired by gene flow from coastal regions after the ancestors of the Bubi settled in Bioko. For example, the presence of both Fang and Benga people in Bioko has been described in historical times, partly related to the slave trade. In fact, although the slave trade was not so important in Bioko, it was very active in other coastal centres of the Gulf of Guinea, especially in some of the minor islands such as Corisco and Annob\u00f3n [42]. Nonetheless, due to the cultural particularities of the Bubi and the clear genetic signals of endogamy and isolation, it seems unlikely they would assimilate a significant number of foreign people. In addition, no signals of potential Iberian admixture have been detected among the Bubi.Within the Bantu-speakers, the Bubi are more closely related to Angolan than to the geographically closer Cameroon groups (this is supported for instance by fineSTRUCTURE or f3 statistics). Based on the evidence that Bantu expansion likely moved from Angola northwards [13], it is possible that Bantu-speaking groups from Cameroon experienced subsequent admixture events with neighbouring RHG populations.The Bubi particularities are mirrored by their geographically induced genetic isolation as well as their linguistic differences with neighbouring, mainland populations. At the linguistic level, the Bubi language is basal to most Bantu languages [40, 43] and clusters together with northwest Bantu speakers. This correlates with archaeological findings from the region dated from 5000 to 2500\u2009years ago and associated to the spread of Bantu languages [40]. This decoupling between language and genetics could be explained if the former was acquired by or imposed onto the Bubi mainland ancestors. Accordingly, there are some historical accounts that consider the Bubi to be an enslaved tribe that escaped to Bioko [44].The Bubi seem to have experienced a certain history of isolation that left a mark in their genomes. Out of all the Bantu-speaking groups, for instance, we found that the Bubi have some of the highest levels of IBD tracks shared among members of the same population, a signal of low diversity that is compatible with endogamy. In fact, in the ROH analysis, the Bubi rank as the second most endogamous Bantu-speaking group, only after the Bekwil. Nevertheless, the fact that the Bubi do not show a large genetic differentiation from potential source populations along the coast also indicates that drift did not have time to operate at large scale and that colonization of the island did not occur a long time ago.The Bubi, like other groups from the Gulf of Guinea, display a high frequency of some mutations associated with protection against malaria. Other mutations, however, are absent or segregating. The underlying mutation for the Duffy-negative phenotype (at the ACKR1 gene) that is known to protect against Plasmodium vivax and P. knowlesi, seems to be fixed, or at least is present at extremely high frequencies, in the Bubi population. In fact, this is a common trait in all Western Africa. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, malaria was responsible for a child mortality rate of 152 per every 1000 births in Bioko island, a figure that is only beginning to decrease thanks to recent malaria control projects [27]. However, in a genome-wide scan performed against the Yoruba, we were unable to identify genomic regions in the Bubi that appear to be shaped by natural selection, even despite their insular conditions.However, due to the limited sampling size and restricted distribution within Bioko, our study has to be considered as a preliminary assessment of the current Bubi genetic diversity. Despite evidences that our sampling size can effectively estimate parameters of genetic diversity from a larger population (see Methods last section), additional sampling with a broader geographical distribution should be undertaken in the future.In addition to the general population affinities of the Bubi, we have unveiled genetic evidences of a certain degree of isolation, which can be related to the insular conditions; this trait is quite unique in most of African mainland populations. Our study of the genomic composition of the Bubi not only adds further information to the current genetic diversity within Africa and its Atlantic islands, but also points to the importance of the genome-wide analyses in unravelling population affinities, selective pressures and past migrations that can be correlated with linguistic and archaeological information. We conclude that the origins of the Bantu expansion still needs further research and that future retrieval of ancient genomes from Central and Western Africa could shed need light on the cradle of the Bantu migrations.All thirteen individuals analysed in this study are members of the Cultural Bubi Association of Fuenlabrada, Madrid (Spain). We obtained informed consent from all subjects. We discarded 25 of the interviewed individuals because of admixed ancestry; many of them had a recent Fang ancestor from the mainland. Even though most of the individuals were not born in Bioko, we verified that the selected individuals had all grandparents born in the island; many of the volunteers\u2019 direct ancestors come from Malabo, Bariob\u00e9 and Baney, which are located in the Northeast region of Bioko (Additional file 1: Table S1).We isolated DNA from cotton swabs using all the available material and an organic-based DNA extraction method adapted to Amicon\u00ae Ultra 0.5-mL columns [45]. After extraction, we concentrated the DNA by centrifugation up to 50\u2009\u03bcL and subjected samples to a quality control. To ensure there was a proper DNA concentration, 1\u2009\u03bcL of sample was loaded in a 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Only a single band was observed. The samples were quantified with BioTek\u2019s Epoch and yielded values, on average, of 68.88\u2009ng/\u03bcL.Genomic DNA libraries were prepared using TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Library Preparation Kit (in accordance with the general settings of the preparation guide). The procedure produced a PCR-free library with 350\u2009bp average insert size that requires 20\u2009ng/ul (in 50 ul samples). DNA samples were randomly fragmented by Covaris system and sequenced in HiSeqX10 (Illumina) with hiseq2x150bp settings plus 65\u2009bp paired-end adapters at Macrogen (South Korea).We evaluated the paired-end sequenced reads with FASTQc to check their quality. The sequencing adapters were then removed using Adapter removal [46], reads shorter than 30\u2009bp were removed, and the reads were mapped against the Human reference genome [National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) 37, hg19] using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) with default parameters [47]. Duplicated reads were removed using Picard Tools MarkDuplicates version 2.8.3 and low quality mapping reads (<\u200930) were removed with SAMtools version 1.623 [48].Unique aligned reads were processed with Base Quality Score Recalibration (BQSR) implemented in the GATK version 3.7 software [49]. Even if the plots did not show signals of systematic errors, we applied recalibration to all filtered reads. We used GATK HaplotypeCaller in GVCF mode for scalable variant calling (using the GRCh37 as a reference sequence). Individual variant calls were merged in a single VCF file using GATK genotypeGVCFs tool, and the variants were filtered using Variant Quality Score Recalibration (VQSR) with a filter level of 99%. We used QD, MQ ReadPosRankSum, FS, and SOR annotations in this step. We excluded any variant with less than 70% of the main depth coverage or more than 200%. We also removed those variants exhibiting qualities below 30. We removed those called variants with a minimum allele frequency below 0.05 and a of Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium p-value below 1e-6.We merged our filtered variants with 690,739 SNPs from 1235 genotyped individuals belonging to 35 Western Africa populations. This dataset includes: Bantu-speaking populations, hunter-gatherers and Western African groups [13],using Plink 1.9 [50] (Additional file 1: Table S2). We excluded triallelic sites, A/T and C/G mutations and all sites with a minor allele frequency (MAF) below 0.05. We subsequently removed positions with >\u200910% missing data and those individuals with >\u20095% missing values. To ensure that genotypes were properly called after merging the dataset, the Yoruba SNP genotypes were compared against the 1000 Genomes Yoruba population. However, subsequent analyses were performed only with the Yoruba genotypes from Western Africa dataset [51]. Positions that exhibited >\u20090.2 values of pairwise Fst between both samples were also removed. Based on the colonial history of Bioko, we have assessed the presence of potential genetic admixture of the Bubi with Spanish individuals, adding Iberian samples from 1000 Genomes [52] to the SNP dataset. After this procedure, we again removed positions with MAF below 0.05, missing data above 0.1 and Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium p-values below 1e-10.For most of the analyses, we have extracted a sub-dataset with representative populations from Western and Central Africa. This reduced dataset includes 14 populations and 169 individuals (Additional file 1: Table S3). Some of the population genomics analysis require an unrelated outgroup to the tested populations. We have merged our genotypes with data of eleven San individuals [53] from the Human Origins array [54], followed with the same merging procedure previously detailed. The resulting African dataset \u2013including the Bubi- comprises 130,647 SNPs present in 1259 individuals.Reads were mapped against the Revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) of the human mtDNA [55]. After calling variants with GATK version 3.7 [49] as has been previously described, the mtDNA haplogroups were predicted using Haplogrep version 2 [56]. Y chromosome haplogroups were predicted by classifying the observed mutations according to the PhyloTree database [57].To situate the Bubi within the present diversity of the Gulf of Guinea and Western Africa, a principal components analysis (PCA) with the reduced dataset was generated using EIGENSOFT software [58], Results were plotted using R package ggplot2 [59, 60].ADMIXTURE plots were generated to estimate the proportions of K ancestral components on each individual genome [61] of the reduced dataset. As the analysis assumes linkage disequilibrium (LD), we pruned the dataset. We used Plink 1.9 to remove SNPs with an LD\u2009>\u2009r2\u2009=\u20090.5 in windows of 50 SNPs. ADMIXTURE analyses were performed with K from 2 to 15 and were repeated five times. The ADMIXTURE iterations were consolidated using CLUMPP with the large K greedy algorithm [62] and the results were plotted using R package pophelper [63].Outgroup f3 statistic is a useful test to determine the closest population to a target one using one outgroup population and measuring the amount of shared genetic drift with a test population. San were selected as outgroup, as they represent the most distant African population with genome-wide data, Bubi population was compared to all other populations in the dataset. The f3 (San; Bubi, Test) statistic was calculated with popstats [64] and the results were again plotted using R. f statistics can also be implemented in order to determine which populations exhibited the highest genetic drift with the Bubi people, to do so, we used the popstats software to compute the f4 statistic (Test, San; Bubi, Mbuti), (Test, San; Bubi, Baka), (Test, San; Bubi, Yoruba), (Test, San; Bubi, Fang). These combinations allow us to dissect the genetic admixture of the tested populations with the Bubi in relation to all the representative source of genetic ancestry in Western Africa: Eastern RHG, Western RHG, Western-African populations and Bantu-speaking populations.The fixation index (Fst) is a measure of population differentiation. We calculated the mean pairwise Fst values between all the populations present in the global dataset. All autosomal SNPs were included in this analysis using the approach of Cockerham and Weir integrated in Plink 1.9 [65]The reduced dataset was phased with SHAPEIT2 [66], using 500 states, 50 MCMC main steps, 10 burn-in and 10 pruning steps; recombination maps were interpolated from the HapMap phase 2 genetic maps. After excluding all positions with at least one missing site, we ended up with a dataset of 491,203 variable positions with no missing data.We used CHROMOPAINTER to build a coancestry matrix based on haplotype data from the phased-reduced dataset. This software estimates the admixture proportions in recipient chromosomes by painting the proportion of each genetic component from the donor populations. We ran CHROMOPAINTER with linked data, estimating n and M parameters through an observation run with no prefixed parameters and including\u00a030 randomly selected samples and three randomly selected chromosomes; fineSTRUCTURE analysis was performed with the counts obtained in CHROMOPAINTER and ran with 1000,000 Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iterations and output printed every 10,000 iterations. The best tree was calculated with 10,000 state attempts. We also generated a haplotype-based PCA with fineSTRUCTURE.To identify any admixture events between Bubi ancestors and other populations during the last 4500\u2009years, we used the GLOBETROTTER [41] software on the basis of the defined clusters from fineSTRUCTURE (Additional file 1: Table S4).Identity by descent (IBD) blocks are defined as identical chromosome fragments present in multiple individuals that have been inherited from the same ancestral chromosome [67]. We have used RefinedIBD software [68] setting \u201cibdcm\u201d\u2009=\u20090.5, \u201cibdtrim\u201d\u2009=\u200962, \u201cibdwindow\u201d\u2009=\u20092478, and \u201coverlap\u201d\u2009=\u2009413; the rest of the parameters were assigned by default. All IBD blocks longer than five centimorgans (cM) were kept and the statistical threshold marked by LOD (the base 10 log of the likelihood ratio of the IBD segments, which is a figure that will depend of the size of the database and the genetic diversity within it) was assigned by default (>\u20093). The number of SNPs used here was 685,382. We then filtered the IBD segments to keep only those that were shared by any Bubi and another individual of the dataset (including the IBD fragments shared by two Bubi individuals). To reduce the impact that the population size could have on the global counts of IBD blocks per population, we corrected the value of the shared IBD fragments (IBDn) by the population size (t). In order to obtain the average of the IBD blocks shared by any Bubi with any other individual or population, we divided each number obtained in the previous step by the number of Bubi individuals, 13:ratioBubi_pop\u2009=\u2009(IBDn/t)/13.ROHs (>\u20091000\u2009kb) were estimated with Plink software. First, we calculated the average (in kilobases) of the genome that it is in homozygosis for each population. Second, we calculated the average of the number of genomic fragments that are in homozygosis for each population.Relevant mutations associated with malaria resistance in 10 different genes (Additional file 1: Table S11) \u2013 as found in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and other previous studies [31, 69] \u2013 were genotyped in Bubi and the 1000 Genomes African populations. Fisher\u2019s exact test was used to determine the statistical significance of the observed differences (p\u2009<\u20090.001).We have used a whole genome Fst approach to evaluate the effects of the small sample size used in this work. We have randomly grouped the 186 Yoruba individuals from 1000 Genomes in 14 subsamples of 13\u201317 individuals and wehave estimated the mean pairwise Fst values among all population combinations. All autosomal SNPs were included in this analysis using the approach of Cockerham and Weir integrated in Plink 1.9 [65]. No comparison has shown values of mean pairwise Fst higher than 0.1, which indicates that the sub samples do not show significant differences in terms of genetic diversity (Additional file 2: Figure S12). This result suggests that the limited Bubi sample size can be used to infer genetic diversity at a higher population level.Base Quality Score RecalibrationFixation indexGenome-wide association studyHuman-leukocyte antigenIdentity by descentLinkage disequilibriumMinor allele frequencyMarkov chain Monte CarloMitochondrial DNANational Center for Biotechnology InformationPrincipal component analysisRainforest hunter-gathererRuns of homozygositySingle nucleotide polymorphismVariant Quality Score Recalibration\u00a0This research was supported by a grant from FEDER and Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (BFU2015\u201364699-P) of Spain to C.L-F.

Of the few islands located in Atlantic Africa, four of them are found within the Gulf of Guinea (Fig.\u00a01a). Bioko is the largest of these islands, with a total area of 2017\u2009km2 (Fig. 1b). It is located 32\u2009km offshore of Cameroon but constitutes in fact, the northernmost part of Equatorial Guinea, a former Spanish colony. The island is volcanic and very mountainous, with an abrupt coastline; despite its small size, its highest peak has an altitude of 3012\u2009m. The indigenous population of Bioko, the Bubi, speak Bubi, a basal Bantu language [1]. The closest Bantu language on the mainland is most likely Galoa, which is spoken by Bantu-speaking groups of the Ogowe basin in Gabon [2]. The Bubi have a distinct and unique culture among Bantu-speaking people [3], including the belief that different spiritual beings reside in specific geographical locations along the island and the existence of well-defined matrilineal clans [4].\n\nFig. 1\na Map of the Gulf of Guinea showing the location of Bioko Island and the neighbouring countries. b Map of the Bioko Island. c Genotype-based principal components analysis (PCA) plot obtained with EIGENSOFT smartpca. A dataset of 168 individuals from 14 populations and 581,224 SNPs are included. The percentage of variance explained is written along the axes. The maps have been created with R package\nMoreover, ADMIXTURE analysis (K\u2009=\u20094) (Fig.\u00a02 and Additional file 2: Figure S3) shows that the Bubi contain the same components as the other Bantu-speaking populations of the dataset but lower levels of the RHG component (in grey) than most of the mainland Bantu-speaking populations (with those from Angola being the exception). Some of the remaining ADMIXTURE plots (K\u2009=\u20092\u201315) (Additional file 2: Figure S4) also indicate potential substructuring among the Bubi; however, the sample size is too small to test if this is correlated with geography.\n\nFig. 2\nGraphical representation of shared genetic components performed using the ADMIXTURE (K\u2009=\u20094) software: 169 individuals from 13 populations and 456,095 SNPs have been plotted. Although the cross-validation errors show the lowest value at K\u2009=\u20092, we have chosen K\u2009=\u20094 because it is the first plot where the crucial RHG, Bantu and Western African components are clearly identified\nTo determine which mainland populations share a higher level of genetic ancestry with the Bubi, we tested all neighbouring populations with the outgroup f3 statistic (considering San as outgroup). Our results indicate that non-Bantu Western African populations such as Yoruba, Bariba, Fon and Azhizi, as well as Bantu-speaking groups from Angola such as Kongo, Ovimbundu and Kimbundu show more genetic affinities with the Bubi, apparently because they all show lower hunter-gatherer ancestry as compared to other groups (Fig.\u00a03 and Additional file 1: Table S8). To explore the possible source of genetic admixture in the Bubi, we have also calculated the f4 statistic for the combinations (Test, San; Bubi, Mbuti), (Test, San; Bubi, Baka), (Test, San; Bubi, Yoruba), (Test, San; Bubi, Fang) (Additional file 2: Figure S5A-D). This selection represents the four major genomic components in the Gulf of Guinea. We have found that the Bubi show the highest levels of shared ancestry with the Western African populations, which do not overlap with other populations when the comparison is established with RHG components. Angolan Bantu-speaking populations such as Ovimbundu, Kongo and Kimbundu also show elevated levels of shared genetic ancestry (Additional file 2: Figure S5). Bubi people seem to have very low levels of genetic admixture from the RHG populations; however, this small signal is absent in Western Africans.\n\nFig. 3\nStatistic f3values obtained with popstats when taking San as outgroup. The statistic and one standard error deviation are presented for each combination test. Blue dots represent Bantu-speaking populations, Green dots represent Western-African populations, orange dots Represent Eastern Hunter-Gatherer populations and purple dots indicate Western Hunter-gatherer populations\nPairwise Fst is a statistic used to measure population differentiation based on allelic frequencies. We used this test to quantify the level of genetic differentiation between all combinations of populations in our dataset. Low levels of Fst statistic indicate that the tested populations share a large proportion of the genotypes, while high levels are indicators of genetic differentiation. Among all African samples, RHG tribes appear to have the highest levels of genetic differentiation, both among themselves and with the agriculturalist groups (Fig.\u00a04). The lowest values of genome-wide Fst for the Bubi are again with Bantu-speaking Angolan groups (Kimbundu, Fst\u2009=\u20090.0045; Ovimbundu, Fst\u2009=\u20090.0045), and also with a Bantu-speaking group from Cameroon (Yaounde, Fst\u2009=\u20090.0045). On the other hand, we found that the Bubi displayed the highest Fst values when compared with RHG populations (Additional file 1: Table S9).\n\nFig. 4\nMatrix of pairwise Fst calculations. The Fst values have been calculated using plink and with a dataset of 592,395 SNPs\nFineSTRUCTURE uses the coancestry matrix obtained from ChromoPainter to classify samples based on haplotype diversity. Using this approach, the matrix and the resulting dendrogram confirm that the closest populations to the Bubi are the Ovimbundu (Fig.\u00a05 and Additional file\u00a02: Figure S7), but also some Gabonese and Cameroonian Bantu-speaking populations. Interestingly, the Bubi are divided into two different clusters (Additional file 1: Table S7), one including only individuals from Bioko Island and the other shared with other Bantu-speaking groups. This, again, suggests some level of substructure in the population. Interestingly, the RHG show a higher level of haplotype differentiation compared to other populations. To additionally test for the presence of Iberian ancestry we have repeated the fineSTRUCTURE analysis including 12 Iberian individuals (Additionlal file 2: Fig. S8), following the same methodology previously described and 244,897 phased SNPs.\n\nFig. 5\nMatrix of shared counts of haplotypes obtained using fineSTRUCTURE. The dataset includes 491,203 SNPs and 169 individuals. The structure of the matrix has been adapted using the fineSTRUCTURE dendrogram. Green label represents the Bubi individuals, red label is used to represent the Gabon-Cameroon Bantu-speaking individuals, Blue label represents the Angolan Bantu-speaking individuals, Yellow label represents the Western-African individuals, Light blue label represents the Eastern Hunter-Gatherer individuals and Brown label represents the and Western Hunter-gatherer populations\nFurthermore, we also estimated identity by descent (IBD) tracks to help elucidate the recent co-ancestry links between the Bubi and mainland populations. We found the Bubi to share the highest number of IBD blocks longer than 2\u2009cM (indicative of genealogical connections occurring during the last 2500\u2009years [29]) with populations from Angola (Ovimbundu, Kongo), as well as some from Gabon (e.g., Obamba, Duma, Bateke and Bapunu) (Fig.\u00a06 and Additional file 1: Table S10). Additionally, we estimated the average of runs of homozygosity (ROHs) in each population, as well as the fraction of the genome in homozygosity as signals of endogamy. We found that the Bubi are the second most endogamous Bantu-speaking group (Additional file 1: Table S11) after the Bekwil population, although the ROHs of RHG tribes were longer on average than those observed among the agriculturalist groups (Additional file 2: Figure S10, Additional file 1: Table S12).\n\nFig. 6\na Average of the genome in homozygosity (in kb) for the Bubi and mainland Bantu populations. b Average of the shared IBD genomic blocks between the Bubi and mainland Bantu populations (IBDs >\u20092\u2009cM).

Visual scores are important traits of cattle production in Brazil because they are utilized as selection criteria, helping to choose more harmonious animals. Despite its importance, there are still no studies on the genome association for these traits. This study aimed to identify genome regions associated with the traits of conformation, precocity and muscling, based on a visual score measured at weaning.Bayesian approaches with BayesC and Bayesian LASSO were utilized with 2873 phenotypes of Nellore cattle for a GWAS. The animals were genotyped with Illumina BovineHD BeadChip, and a total of 309,865 SNPs were utilized after quality control. In the analyses, phenotype and deregressed breeding values were utilized as dependent variables; a threshold model was utilized for the former and a linear model for the latter. The association criterion was the percentage of genetic variance explained by SNPs found in 1\u2009Mb-long windows. The Bayesian approach BayesC was better adjusted to the data because it could explain a larger phenotypic variance for both dependent variables.There were no large effects for the visual scores, indicating that they have a polygenic nature; however, regions in chromosomes 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20 and 23 were identified and explained a large part of the genetic variance.With the advent of bovine genome sequencing [1], new information has become available for the prediction of genetic values through genomic selection (GS) and to locate regions or associated genes with phenotypes of interest through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [2, 3]. In GWAS analyses, simple regression models are frequently utilized, however, this method has two limitations. The first limitation is the overestimation of the variance proportion explained by a marker, once it does not consider the existing linkage disequilibrium (LD) among markers [4]. The second limitation is the high rate of false positives when the population structure is not taken into consideration [5]. The use of Bayesian multiple regression models initially proposed for GS [6], such as Bayesian LASSO [7] and BayesC [8], overcomes these limitations.The Bayesian approach differs with respect to a priori distribution for QTL (quantitative trait locus) effects. Bayesian LASSO assumes that there are few genes with large effects and many genes with small or no effects, whereas BayesC assumes that most SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) are not associated with phenotype, and only a small \u03c0 portion has some effect on traits. The best model depends on the trait genetic architecture, which is unknown, mainly when the traits have not been extensively studied [9].In cattle, association studies have been carried out for most economically important traits [10\u201313]. However, GWAS have not yet been conducted for morphological traits evaluated through visual scores in beef cattle, which have a high relevance to Brazilian cattle breeding. The utilization of these traits by producers as selection criteria is important for the identification of harmonious animals and its correlation with economic interest traits, mainly those for growth [14\u201316] and those that indicate carcass quality [17\u201319].In dairy cattle, the results of some association studies for linear evaluations of type, which assess several morphological traits [20\u201323], are already available. In general, these studies did not find regions with large effects, showing that morphological traits have a polygenic nature; that is, they are controlled by multiple genes with small effects [5]. The distribution of QTL effects for traits is a factor that influences the prediction accuracy of genomic breeding values and this accuracy is greater when there are large effect QTLs [5, 24].Due to the importance of visual scores for Brazilian cattle breeding, it is desirable that the regions involved in the genetic control of these traits have pleiotropic effects on other important economic traits and that there are large effect QTLs, resulting in greater genetic gains when utilized as selection criteria. This study aimed to identify genome regions associated with the traits of conformation (C), precocity (P) and muscling (M) visual scores, measured at the weaning of Nellore cattle, and to compare BayesC and Bayesian LASSO in a genomic association study.Data collection procedures were reviewed and approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal Care and Use (CEUA) of the S\u00e3o Paulo State University, UNESP - Jaboticabal, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil (protocol number: 18.340/16).Data were used from Nellore males and females, born between 2007 and 2011, belonging to two animal breeding programs, DeltaGen and Paint, and including more than 250 farms distributed across Brazil. Although the animals were from two distinct programs, they had a similar objective selection for weaning and yearling weight, and several sires were common to both programs, which were used for artificial insemination service. A previous GWAS analysis on birth weight revealed that the animals from these two breeding programs clustered in the same group (\u201ccluster 1\u201d) of a principal component analysis based on the genomic kinship coefficient [25].Phenotypes for the visual scores were evaluated at weaning. Each contemporary group was assessed by a single technician. First, the whole herd was observed and characterized. Then, the average profile for each trait was used as a basis of comparison to attribute scores that varied from 1 to 5, where 5 was the highest expression and 1 was the smallest expression. Each visual score was defined as [26]: conformation (C) estimates the amount of meat on the carcass by length, body depth and muscle development; precocity (P) represents the ability of the animal to display the lowest acceptable degree of finishing with a low body weight, considering rib depth and fat deposition at the groin and tail of the animals at the time of evaluation; muscling (M) measures the amount of muscular mass, using as a reference the muscular development in the shoulder, foreleg, loin, rump and hind.Estimation of the breeding values (EBVs) of scores was done through a multi-trait threshold animal model, as described by [27]. Direct and maternal genetic, permanent environmental and residual effects were included as random effects, whereas contemporary group (farm, year of birth, management group at weaning, and sex) was used as a fixed effect and age at measurement was used as a co-variable (linear and quadratic effect). Genetic parameters and breeding values were estimated utilizing THRGIBBS1F90 software, which implements the Bayesian approach under a threshold model [28]. A total of 236,288 animals with phenotypes born from 1990 to 2012 and 300,484 animals included in the relationship matrix were used to estimate breeding values. EBV accuracy was calculated as described by [29] and deregressed breeding values were calculated using the methodology described by [30].The animals were genotyped with Illumina BovineHD BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. BovineHD BeadChip has 777,962 SNPs scattered throughout the genome with an average distance of 3.43\u2009kb between markers. The inclusion criteria used to control genotype quality were: SNPs located in autosomes; call rate per SNP greater than 0.95; call rate per animal greater than 0.90; minor allele frequency greater than 0.05; p-value for Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test less than 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2212\u20095 (extreme equilibrium deviations suggest potential genotyping errors). Highly co-related SNPs (r2\u00a0>\u20090.98) were excluded. Quality control was an interactive process that stopped when no SNP or sample were excluded, resulting in 309,865 SNPs for analyses that considered phenotype as the dependent variable, and 308,861, 308,561 and 308,481 SNPs for C, P and M, respectively, when the dependent variable was dEBV. Quality control and the input of missing genotypes were done with the snpStats package of R software [31].where: Y is a vector n\u2009\u00d7\u20091 of phenotype or dEBVs for the visual score of C, P and M; X is an n\u2009\u00d7\u2009p matrix that relates \u03b2 vectors of fixed effects with Y; Z is an n\u2009\u00d7\u2009k matrix of genotypes (0 for the first homozygote AA; 1 for the heterozygote AB or BA; 2 for the second homozygote BB) of k SNPs; \u03b1 is a k\u2009\u00d7\u20091 vector of random coefficients of regression for SNPs (an effect of allele substitution) and e is a residual vector with a normal distribution N \u223c\u2009(0, I\u03c32e), where \u03c32e is the residual variance, considered unknown with a scaled inverse Chi-square distribution [32].The difference between Bayesian approaches is the a priori marginal distribution assumed for \u03b1, which determines the variable selection and shrinkage in SNP effect estimates. For LASSO, the assumed distribution for effects is double-exponential. This distribution has a greater density at zero and thicker tails than a normal distribution, which causes an effect-dependent shrinkage because SNPs with small effects are regressed toward zero with greater shrinkage than the SNPs with large effects [7, 33]. Shrinkage level is controlled by the \u03bb hyperparameter, which was inferred from data a priori using a Gamma distribution. For BayesC, the a priori effect distribution is a mixture at zero point mass and a normal distribution [8]. The proportion of SNPs with effects different from zero is controlled by the \u03c0 hyperparameter, which was fixed at 0.01 instead of being inferred from the data since [34] found convergence problems when the \u03c0 value was inferred from data. When score phenotype was considered a dependent variable, a threshold model with the probit function was utilized. The model assumes that there is a random variable subjacent to the observable phenotype, termed liability, which follows a standard normal distribution. The variance residual was fixed at 1 to make the estimation feasible. Fixed effects considered in the models were: contemporary group (formed by the management group at weaning, farm, birth year and sex) and weaning age, considered a co-variable. When dEVBs were the dependent variable, a linear model was utilized and only the average effect was considered a fixed effect in the model.Analyses were carried out with the BGLR package of the software R [35], which implements Gibbs sampler to sample a posteriori parameter distributions. A total of 800,000\u2009cycle chains were sampled. The first 200,000 were discarded as burn in and the remaining 600,000 samples were left for parameter inference.where: k is the number of SNPs within window j; Xik is the genotype of animal i for SNP k and \u03b1k is the allele substitution effect for SNP k. For 1 SNP windows, this method is equivalent to 2pk(1\u2009\u2212\u2009pk)\u03b12k [38]. The Bayesian approach that explained the greater proportion of phenotypic variance was chosen to identify genome regions associated with the phenotype; the genes for the windows that explained values above 0.25% of the additive genetic variance were identified, and a candidate gene was proposed as responsible for the variance explained by the window.The database from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/), loaded with bovine genome version UMD 3.1, was utilized to identify genes within the windows. Gene classification with respect to biological function was done through the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) [39], available at http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/.A total of 190 genes were located in 14 associated windows with the phenotype of visual scores: 150 genes were codified proteins, 16 were ncRNA (non-codifying RNA), 3 were miRNA (microRNA), 6 were tRNA (RNA transporter) and 15 were pseudogenes. In the identification of candidate genes, only genes that codify proteins were considered. Thus, 18 candidate genes were identified and classified into four groups according to the function that they perform in the organism: basal and cellular metabolism (TBC1D5, LPAR2, TMEM9, NDUFA13, GSTA3 and FBXL17), regulation and transcription of other genes (CREG1, POU2F1, MAPK11, MAPK12, ESRRG and STK3), lipid metabolism (SORL1 and ASCF2) and genes related to growth and skeletal muscle (C1QTNF3, PPP1R39, WFIKKN2 and IGFBP6). Furthermore, windows located in chromosomes 3 (0.4\u201314\u2009Mb), 5 (118.7\u2013119.7\u2009Mb), 16 (20.7\u201321.7\u2009Mb) and 23 (24.1\u201325.1\u2009Mb) were associated with at least two scores (Table 3).The difference between the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by SNPs and trait heritability, a difference known as lost heritability [40], can be explained by several factors, such as the lack of LD among markers and QTLs, interactions between variants, or interactions between genetics and the environment [41]. Another possible explanation could be the sample size, as it is necessary to increase the number of genotyped animals to capture small effect QTLs [42].With respect to the Bayesian approaches used, BayesC had a better fit to the data as it was nearest to heritability and explained the largest phenotypic variance. In addition, phenotype was superior to dEBVs, although some authors have considered estimated breeding values (EBV) to be the best dependent variable for GWAS analyses [43] as they are the best estimate of genetic breeding value. The smallest phenotypic variance captured by the models that used dEBVs can be a consequence of a smaller number of animals used and a low estimation accuracy; once, 46% of genotyped animals only had one parent and 58% did not have progeny, resulting in 75% of EBVs with an accuracy ranging from 0.60 to 0.70.The great number of windows needed to explain 10% of the genetic variance (Table 2) indicates that there are no large effect QTLs; therefore, the visual scores evaluated in Nellore cattle are influenced by many small effect genes, as reported for morphological traits in dairy cattle, in which large effect regions have not been identified, and the identified regions were not common among the studies [20\u201323].The presence of genes related to basal and cellular metabolism, located in significant windows, is explained by the fact that these genes act on several tissues, affecting cell and body development as a whole and, therefore, contributing to general performance. These genes have an important pleiotropic effect because they are non-specific tissues that act on several body cells and metabolic pathways, which include: signaling among cells, protein synthesis and transportation, cell proliferation and survival, and transportation and formation of cell membrane and its receptors. The gene protein NDUFA13 (also known as GRIM-19) is found in this gene group and it is a functional component of mitochondrial complex I, which is also involved in apoptosis and cellular energy production processes [44]; modifications in this gene could cause lower energy availability for cellular processes, decreasing tissue growth. Another example is gene FBXL17, which intervenes in protein recycling processes in part of proteosoma 26S, acting on several cellular processes. This gene is expressed at different levels in the skeletal muscle of bovines from 8 to 12\u2009months old, indicating that it is associated with muscle development at this age [45].Genes that regulate transcription can be divided into two subgroups: one formed by the genes STK3, MAPK11 and MAPK12, which belong to the kinase family (serine/threonine-protein subgroup), and another that includes genes POU2F1, CREG1 and ESRRG, whose main function is to modulate genetic expression (transcription factor).Kinases are enzymes that catalyze protein phosphorylation through the transfer of the ATP phosphoryl group, changing protein configuration and resulting in its activation or inactivation. Kinases represent the largest protein family in eukaryotes and are involved in multiple cellular processes, including cellular signaling mechanisms and the activation of transcription factors [46]. The gene STK3 (known in humans as MST2) acts as a repressor of genes involved in the fat deposition of Hanwoo bovines; the high expression levels of this gene have been associated with a low level of intramuscular fat, showing that this gene inhibits adipocyte proliferation [47]. The genes MAPK11 and MAPK12 are part of the metabolic pathway p38 MAPK, which is a preserved mechanism of cellular response to a broad variety of extracellular signals, and is proposed as a regulator of cellular differentiation, proliferation and development [48]. As p38 MAPK is not tissue-specific, it would explain why this region was associated with the phenotype for all three visual scores.In the second subgroup, genes POU2F1 and CREG1 are transcription factors that regulate the activity of multiple genes that act on several metabolic pathways; among them are genes involved in growth, proliferation and cellular differentiation processes. POU2F1 was identified by [49] as one of the transcription factors that regulates the genes associated with the traits of growth and fat deposition in Iberian x Landrace pigs, whereas [50] found differences in the genic expression level of CREG1 in the psoas major and flexor digitorium muscles of bovines, indicating that both genes act on the skeletal muscles and fat tissue. Gene ESRRG is a member of the receptor family related to estrogen (ESRR) that act as transcription activators for gene PERM1, involved in the energy metabolism of skeletal and cardiac muscle [51], making this gene associated with deposition in fat and muscle tissue.Both genes involved in lipid metabolism were associated with the precocity score, which evaluates the animal\u2019s capacity to deposit fat. Gene SORL1 belongs to the low-density lipoprotein receptor family (LDLR) involved in cholesterol metabolism, whereas ACSF2 is associated with lipid metabolism and adipocyte differentiation. These two genes have been associated with intramuscular fat deposition in swine and bovines [52, 53].Out of the four genes related to growth, three were associated with precocity and muscling, and the miostatin gene (GDF8) region did not show an association with visual scores. The miostatin gene is important in muscular development and is one of the genes responsible for the presence of double musculature in breeds like the Belgian Blue and Limousin. Gene PPP1R39 (also known as SH3RF2), like the miostatin gene, negatively regulates muscular tissue growth once low expression levels are associated with muscular hypertrophy. Studying fast and slow growth lines in broiler chickens [54], found out that a deletion had been fixed for gene SH3RF2 in the fast growth line, and it was identified as the cause of the largest growth. In bovines [55], found out that this gene was under selection in the Blonde d\u2019Aquitane breed, and was one of the genes responsible for the double muscle presence in animals.Gene WFIKKN2 is an inhibitory protein of genes GDF8 (miostatin) and GDF11, involved in muscular development, leading the overexpression of this gene to produce muscular hypertrophy, as the miostatin gene negatively regulates muscular growth, as observed in rats and sheep [56, 57]. Genes IGFBP6 and C1QTNF3 positively regulate muscular growth in bovines and high expression levels are associated with cellular growth in skeletal muscles. Gene C1QTNF3 is also involved in subcutaneous and intramuscular fat deposition [58, 59].Windows located in chromosomes 3, 5, 16 and 23 were associated with at least two scores; this was expected since the genetic correlations among the traits were high, ranging from 0.80 to 0.92, indicating that the same genes were controlling the visual scores. The results of this study will help the selection process as the increase of favorable allele frequencies for identified genes will lead to greater genetic gains in visual scores.According to our results, visual scores have a polygenic nature because regions explaining a great percentage of the genetic variance were not found. However, DNA regions associated with visual scores were identified, containing genes that are part of important biological processes and molecular functions in body development.Conformationderegressed breeding valuesBreeding valuesGenomic breeding valuesGenomic selectionGenome-wide association studiesHardy\u2013Weinberg equilibriumLinkage disequilibriumMusclingPrecocityThis study was supported by a grant from the S\u00e3o Paulo State Foundation (FAPESP) no. 2009/16118\u20135.

For genome association studies, the phenotype of visual scores and the deregressed breeding values (dEBV) were used as dependent variables for 2873 records after accounting for quality control and the smaller number of records for dEVBs (Table\u00a01) as only animals with an accuracy over 0.60 were considered for inclusion.Table 1\nNumber of records, according to the dependent variable, in genome association analyses for visual scores of conformation (C), precocity (P) and muscling (M)\n\ndEBV deregressed breeding value; *frequency for phenotypic values and averages for deregressed breeding values, dEBV\nBayesian approaches BayesC and Bayesian LASSO were utilized to estimate marker effects. Both Bayesian approaches differ in their a priori distributions, which are assumed for marker effects. In general, the models can be presented in matrix notation as: (1)With the use of a high-density chip, QTL effects can be distributed across several SNPs that are in LD with QTL, resulting in non-significant individual SNP effects [36, 37]; therefore, SNPs were grouped in 1\u2009Mb-long windows, overlapping every 100\u2009kb, totaling 25,250 windows. The amount of SNPs per window varied from 1 to 336, with an average of 122\u2009\u00b1\u200925.2 SNPs. The genetic variance percentage, explained by each window, was the criterion used to identify windows associated with scores; it was calculated as follows: (2)where: %\u03c32j is the genetic variance percentage explained by window j; \u03c32j is the genetic variance explained by window j; \u03c32SNP is the genetic variance explained by SNPs; h2 is the trait heritability and h2SNP is the phenotypic variance proportion explained by markers (marker heritability). \u03c32j and \u03c32SNP were calculated as the variance of genomic breeding values (GEBV) of each window or the whole genome. GEBV for animal i in window j was calculated as: (3)In general, the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by SNPs was smaller than trait heritability. Moreover, BayesC explained the largest phenotypic variance and was nearest to heritability, and among the dependent variables, phenotype was superior to dEBVs. Table\u00a02 also shows the number of windows that captured 10% of the genetic variance; in this criterion, BayesC with phenotype was superior, as well.Table 2\nProportion of phenotypic variance explained by BayesC and Bayesian LASSO and the number of windows needed to explain 10% of the genetic variance for the visual scores of conformation (C), precocity (P) and muscling (M)\n\ndEBV\u2009=\u2009deregressed estimated breeding values; h2\u00a0=\u2009estimated heritability utilizing the threshold model; \u03c32SNP\u00a0=\u2009variance explained by SNPs; \u03c3e2\u00a0=\u2009residual variance; h2SNP\u00a0=\u2009proportion of phenotypic variance explained by SNPs, values in brackets [] indicate the proportion related to additive genetic variance; 10% \u03c3a2\u00a0=\u2009number of windows that capture 10% of the genetic variance\nThe identification of regions associated with visual scores was done through BayesC, utilizing phenotype as the dependent variable, because it was the Bayesian approach that best explained the proportion of phenotypic variance for all three visual scores. In Fig.\u00a01 and Table\u00a03, the windows that explained over 0.25% of the additive genetic variance for conformation, precocity and muscling are shown. Due to the great number of windows that were necessary to explain 10% of the genetic variance, and just a few windows exceeding the threshold of 0.25%, windows that were very close to the threshold were also included. For these windows, candidate genes responsible for the genetic variance explained by the window were proposed.\n\nFig. 1\nPercentage of genetic variance explained by windows in each chromosome using the Bayesian approach BayesC, considering phenotype as the dependent variable of visual scores for conformation, precocity and muscling.

Sex differences in pain sensitivity and chronic pain prevalence are well established. However, the molecular basis underlying these sex dimorphisms are poorly understood particularly with regard to the role of the peripheral nervous system. Here we sought to identify shared and distinct gene networks functioning in the peripheral nervous systems that may contribute to sex differences of pain in rats after nerve injury.We performed RNA-seq on dorsal root ganglia following chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve in male and female rats. Analysis from paired naive and injured tissues showed that 1513 genes were differentially expressed between sexes. Genes which facilitated synaptic transmission in na\u00efve and injured females did not show increased expression in males.Appreciating sex-related gene expression differences and similarities in neuropathic pain models may help to improve the translational relevance to clinical populations and efficacy of clinical trials of this major health issue.Once established chronic pain is often resistant to existing treatments and associated with adverse health outcomes such as decreased quality of life [1], alterations in mood [2] and sleep patterns [3], and disability [4]. Sex differences in the susceptibility to most chronic pain conditions are well established [5] and experimental pain studies consistently demonstrate greater pain sensitivity, increased pain ratings, and decreased tolerance to a variety of pain modalities in women versus men [5\u20139]. However, the mechanisms underpinning these sex dimorphisms are poorly understood.While the inclusion of women in clinical trials has increased dramatically during the past 20\u2009years, a strong bias towards the exclusive use of male animals in preclinical studies of neuropathic pain has persisted [10, 11]. Arguably, the limited use of females in mechanistic studies of neuropathic pain has obfuscated our understanding, management, and treatment of neuropathic pain in either sex [10, 11]. The few studies that have used rodent models of chronic pain to examine sex-specific differences have primarily focused on the hormonal and neuroimmune effects on pain modulation in the central nervous system (CNS) [12]. For example, activated immune cells (e.g., microglia) in the spinal cord dorsal horn release inflammatory mediators (e.g., cytokines) in response to tissue damage which promote neuronal excitability [13]. Although the role of microglia-neuronal signaling pathways in pain pathophysiology had been characterized using predominantly male mice, recent evidence demonstrated that female and male mice use distinct immune cell types to modulate pain behaviors [14, 15].Chronic pain following peripheral nerve injury is associated with profound changes in gene expression that alter synaptic plasticity and neuroimmune interactions. The majority of studies have examined gene expression changes exclusively in males [10, 11, 16]. One notable exception is a 2006 study by LaCroix-Fralish and colleagues [17] in which microarrays were used to measure the gene expression in the rat dorsal horn after spinal nerve ligation in both male and female rats. Despite the potential for gene expression to yield insight into the molecular underpinnings of chronic pain, a transcriptome-wide assessment of gene expression in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) after nerve injury in male and female rats has not been reported.Here we sought to identify the similarities and differences in gene regulation between male and female rats in the PNS following peripheral nerve injury. We compare large-scale transcriptome analyses of dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) from male and female rats, in both naive and a peripheral nerve injury model, and identified differential expression of mediators of neurochemical mechanisms. Our RNA-seq suggests that data sexually dimorphic roles of sensory neurons and glia in the DRG may be an important consideration in clinical drug trials designed to evaluate treatments for chronic pain.A total of 146 genes were specifically upregulated in females after CCI and had no significant change in gene expression in males. The functional pathways identified from this set of genes include response to glucocorticoid (GO:0051384) and response to corticosteroid (GO:0051412) (Fig. 6c). Some examples of genes associated with these pathways include Ahr, Cad, Cdkn1a, Fos, Reln, and Socs3 (Fig. 6d).A total of 859 genes were specifically upregulated in males after CCI and had no expression change in females. The functional pathways identified from this set of genes include gated channel activity (GO:002836), ion cannel activity (GO:0022839), substrate-specific channel activity (GO:0022838), and metal ion transmembrane transporter activity (GO:0046873) (Fig. 6c). Examples of genes associated with these pathways include potassium channels (i.e., Kcna4, Kcnb1, Kcnh7, Kcnma1, Kcnq5, Kcnt2, Kcnv1), calcium channels (i.e., Cacna2d3, Cacnb4), Oprm1, and Scn8a (Fig. 6d). A complete list of genes found to be significantly differentially expressed between males and females after CCI is provided in Additional\u00a0file\u00a04. Four genes were regulated in opposite directions after injury. Adamts4, Cyp2s1, Top2a, and Cenpf were upregulated in female rats and downregulated in male rats after CCI compared with naive controls. Actg2, Casq1, Pla2g2a, Acta2, and Clec1b were upregulated in males and downregulated in females.We divided the genes downregulated after CCI that had an FDR <\u20090.05 and |log2FC|\u2009>\u20090.5 into the following 3 groups: 1) genes downregulated in both males and females, 2) genes downregulated in females with no change of gene expression in males, 3) genes downregulated in males with no change of gene expression in females (Additional file 5B). No significant functional pathways were enriched using the genes common to both males and females or in genes significantly downregulated only in females. Genes downregulated only in females showed significant enrichment in the Mitochondrial membrane part GO cellular component (Additional file 5C). Genes downregulated only in males showed significant enrichment in pathways enriched for extracellular matrix-related pathways (Additional file 5C).Few studies have addressed sex-specific alterations in gene expression in neuropathic pain models, and as a result, the molecular pathways underlying sex differences in neuropathic pain are poorly understood. In addition, gene expression data are available for several types of neuronal tissue from rats, mice, and humans; however, to our knowledge, RNA-seq derived whole transcriptome analysis of the DRG, which contain the cell bodies of primary sensory neurons, has not been performed in these organisms. In the present study, we use RNA-seq to compare the gene expression profiles in lumbar DRGs between male and female rats under both na\u00efve and nerve injury conditions. While additional biological replicates would allow additional genes with more subtle gene expression changes to be identified, our results highlight vast differences in the regulation of genes in PNS that are associated with pain-relevant pathways between females and males after injury. However, both sexes upregulate similar groups of genes associated with neuron regrowth pathways.Our gene expression profiles from naive DRGs of male and female rats provide important insights into the normal expression of PNS genes in an unperturbed organism. Remarkably, only 6% of all genes expressed in the na\u00efve DRGs were differentially expressed by sex. Furthermore, these genes that were differentially expressed between sexes did not enrich for pathways directly implicated in either nerve injury or nociception. However, genes that had increased expression in na\u00efve females did show enrichment in immune-related pathways. Increased expression in females of immune-related genes is not unexpected since the connection between sex hormones and immune function is tightly linked. While comprehensive mechanisms for the sexual dimorphism in nociceptive pain have yet to be determined, current evidence supports an important role of sex hormones in pain modulation through the innate and adaptive immune systems [12, 19]. Overall, females mount a stronger humoral, cellular, and inflammatory response than males which is largely attributed to differences in circulating levels of sex hormones especially the decreased levels of androgens [20, 21]. The effects of circulating androgens are known to dampen proinflammatory cytokine production through release of IL-10 by Th1 cells [22] in males. Inflammatory cytokines modulate neuronal excitability through changes in the composition, density, and spatial distribution of ion channels and receptors in the neuronal membrane [23, 24]. Therefore, males may experience less pain as a result of a damped pro-inflammatory immune response after a pain-initiating stimulus. Indeed, evidence from experimental pain studies of pain-free individuals demonstrates a more pronounced temporal summation and greater pain sensitivity in females versus males [5].Genes that were similarly upregulated in the DRG of both sexes after nerve injury were related to neuron regeneration, pain, and intercellular signaling. Following nerve injury, neuronal pathways involved in the regeneration of damaged axons are activated in attempts to recover lost motor, sensory, and autonomic functions. These regenerative mechanisms involve sprouting from the end of the damaged axon toward the denervated segments of the cell, collateral branching of the undamaged neurons around the injury, and long-term reorganization of neuronal circuits in the CNS in response to aberrant peripheral signals [25]. Changes in gene expression and redistribution of receptors and ion channels in the neuronal membrane [26] may partially compensate for incomplete reinnervation; however, altered sensation and loss of fine motor control may produce functional deficits as well as maladaptive alterations (e.g., enhanced spinal reflexes, neuropathic pain).The few existing studies of sex differences in nerve regeneration suggest that regeneration of myelinated neurons occurs more rapidly in females than males [27\u201329]. However, Tong and colleagues recently found no sex differences in axon regeneration of axotomized neurons [30]. Our findings support the latter study since after CCI no significant sex-specific transcriptional differences exist in genes known to be involved in axon regeneration and neuron projection development. Discrepancies in neuron regeneration timing may be attributed to differences of nerve injury models, measures of regeneration, and timing of assessments.After nerve injury, male and female rats showed transcriptional changes in genes that share common GO biological processes (i.e., Behavior, Regulation of ion transport). However, less than one fourth of the genes that were enriched for each of these common processes are shared between males and females. For example, Akap9 (A-kinase anchor protein 9) is a member of the Regulation of Ion Transport GO biologic process and, in our study, is significantly upregulated in females but not in males after CCI. Akap9 interacts with members in signaling transduction pathways (e.g., protein kinase A, serine/threonine kinase protein kinase N, protein phosphatase 1) [31] and loss-of-function mutations are associated with Long QT syndromes [32]. The role of Akap9 in peripheral nerves has not been reported; however, its link to regulating membrane potential suggests Akap9 could contribute to a sex-specific pain mechanism by increasing neuron excitability after nerve injury in females.Oprm1 is also represented in the Regulation of Ion Transport GO biologic process, but in contrast to Akap9, Oprm1 is significantly upregulated after injury in males but not in females. Importantly, Oprm1 encodes the \u03bc-opioid receptor (MOR) which is targeted by the agonist morphine to produce profound analgesia. Zubieta and colleagues [33] found that, in relation to women, men experienced increased activation of the endogenous analgesic mechanisms in several brain regions during infusion of hypertonic saline into the masseter muscle as demonstrated by increased binding of radiolabeled carfentanil to MORs. Further, several preclinical studies report that morphine produces greater analgesia in male animals in the setting of chronic inflammatory pain [34, 35]. In the present DRG-focused study, the higher Oprm1 expression in males after injury unveiled a possible peripheral mechanism that contributes to sex differences in morphine analgesia and endogenous analgesic mechanisms. Consistent with this finding, we previously demonstrated a relative decrease in efficacy of a peripherally-acting MOR agonist DALDA (dermorphin [D-Arg2, Lys4 (1\u20134) amide) to inhibit neuropathic pain-related behavior after systemic administration in female rats versus male rats [36].Another important DRG transcript we found upregulated after CCI in both male and female rats was Csf1 (colony-stimulating factor 1). Csf1 is transported from the DRG to the spinal cord dorsal horn where it binds to its receptor (i.e., Csf1r) located on microglia whose activation promotes the CNS changes necessary for mechanical hypersensitivity [37]. Our results are consistent with a recent study [37] in which Csf1 was reported to be expressed de novo in injured sensory neurons following peripheral nerve injury. Importantly, we found Csf1 expression was 1.7 times higher in females than in males. Further studies will be required to examine if and how sex-specific regulation of Csf1 factors into differences between males and females in their susceptibility to chronic pain syndromes.While we were unable to resolve cell type specificity of gene expression from bulk DRG, recent single cell expression studies have identified subpopulations of neuronal and non-neuronal cells within male DRG [44, 45]. Ultimately, understanding how sex-specific differences in PNS gene expression arise at a single cell level could help facilitate drugs regimens that limit off-target effects. While our study was limited to understanding differential gene expression during the maintenance phase of nerve-injury induced chronic pain, earlier time points should yield valuable insights into transcriptional changes that occur during the developmental phase. In addition, future studies are needed to examine the functional implications of differentially expressed genes between males and females in the DRG after CCI.Our findings build upon existing knowledge of differential pain sensitivity and susceptibility to chronic pain and highlight the profound differences in peripheral mechanisms between males and females after nerve injury which has not been well studied. First, baseline differences in immune function in the PNS may predispose females to developing chronic pain conditions. Second, functional pathways relevant to both sexes that become altered after injury may have important underlying differences in gene expression. Failures of preclinical treatments to translate into humans may be at least partially due to sex-specific alterations in gene expression and existing biases for exclusion of females in preclinical studies. Increased attention to sex differences in preclinical pain studies may improve the translational relevance to clinical populations.Adult male and female Sprague Dawley rats (RRID: RGD_5508397; Harlan Bioproducts for Science, Indianapolis, IN) were randomly assigned to undergo CCI surgery or no treatment (i.e., naive control). All surgical procedures were performed by the same individual to avoid variation in technique. All animals: Animals were allowed to acclimate for a minimum of 48\u2009h before any experimental procedures, housed 2\u20133 per cage, and given access ad libitum to food and water. CCI surgery group: CCI surgery to the sciatic nerve was performed as previously described [46]. Under 2% isoflurane, a small incision was made at the level of the mid-thigh. The sciatic nerve was exposed by blunt dissection through the biceps femoris. The nerve trunk proximal to the distal branching point was loosely ligated with four 4\u20130 silk sutures placed approximately 0.5\u2009mm apart until the epineuria was slightly compressed and minor twitching of the relevant muscles was observed. The muscle layer was closed with 4\u20130 silk suture and the wound closed with metal clips. On postoperative day 14, naive and CCI rats were euthanized by overdose of isoflurane and the ipsilateral L4-L6 DRGs were quickly dissected, immediately submerged in liquid nitrogen, and stored at \u2212\u200980\u2009\u00b0C until RNA extraction. The ipsilateral L4-L6 DRGs from a single rat were pooled and define each sample. Of note, we did not identify the stage of estrus in the female rats. Existing literature suggests that freely cycling rodents do not exhibit increased variability of study outcomes including pain behaviors [10, 47\u201350]. In addition, during the 14-day period between surgery and tissue harvest, each rat passes through each stage of the estrus cycle multiple times during which any differences due to the stage of estrus would average out. Veterinary care and animal housing is provided by Johns Hopkins University Animal Services and the Division of Comparative Medicine.Mechanical hypersensitivity was measured using von Frey monofilaments as previously described [51]. Animals were assessed at baseline and on day 14 after CCI (Additional\u00a0file\u00a07). The animals were placed in individual plexiglass cages on top of a wire mesh and allowed to acclimate for 1\u2009h. Tactile stimulation to the midplantar surface of each hind paw was performed using calibrated monofilaments with gradually increasing stiffness (i.e., 0.37, 0.61, 1.23, 2.0, 4.0, 5.93, 10.0, 13.5\u2009g). Each monofilament was applied for 4\u20136\u2009s in the area between the footpads on the plantar surface of the hind paw. Monofilaments with increasing force were applied until a positive response was observed (e.g., abrupt paw withdrawal, shaking, licking). When a positive response was observed, the monofilament with the next lower force was then applied. The test continued 1) for 5 stimulations after a positive test was observed or 2) the upper or lower range of the von Frey monofilament set was obtained. The paw withdrawal threshold was determined as previously described. If a rat did not achieve at least a 50% reduction in baseline paw withdrawal threshold after 48\u2009h or on day 14, then this animal was not used (n\u00a0=\u20093). In addition to one animal of each sex that failed to show adequate reduction of withdrawal thresholds, one na\u00efve animal was remove from analysis due to responses at a much lower mechanical threshold than normal.Total RNA was extracted from pooled ipsilateral lumbar DRGs (L4\u20136) from one rat using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Prep Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA; #74104) with on-column DNase digestion (Qiagen; #79254) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA concentration was measured using the Nanodrop ND-2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and RNA integrity was assessed using RNA Nano Eukaryote chips in an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA).Five hundred nanograms of total RNA per sample was used to construct sequencing libraries (n\u00a0=\u20091 rat/sample and run in independent biological duplicates per group per sex). Strand-specific RNA libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs; # E7420S) after poly(A) selection by the NEBNext poly(A) mRNA Isolation Module (New England Biolabs; #X7490) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Samples were barcoded using the recommended NEBNext Multiplex Oligos (New England Biolabs; #E7490). Size range and quality of libraries were verified on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies; Palo Alto, CA). RNA-seq libraries were quantified by qPCR using the KAPA library quantification kit (KAPA Biosystems). Each library was normalized to 2\u2009nM and pooled in equimolar concentrations. Paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq2500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Two independent biological replicates of 1 rat per group per sex were run for a total of 8 libraries. Libraries were sequenced to an average depth of 47.6 million reads per sample in two batches. Samples from each batch were multiplexed and resequenced in a single HiSeq lane to evaluate for batch effects. Data was preprocessed using the identical pipeline and Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated (Additional file 8). No correction for batch effects was performed.Sequencing reads were aligned to annotated RefSeq genes in the rat reference genome (rn6) using HISAT2 [52]. Aligned reads were filtered to remove ribosomal RNA and visualized using the Integrative Genomics Viewer [53]. A gene count matrix that contained raw transcript counts for each annotated gene were generated using the featureCounts function of the Subread package in R [54] against the Ensemble rn6 transcriptome. We filtered this matrix by removing genes with zero counts across all samples and relied on the automatic and independent filtering used by DESeq2 to determine the most appropriate threshold for removing genes with low counts [55].To identify genes that were differentially regulated following nerve injury, transcript counts were normalized and log2 transformed using the default normalization procedures in DESeq2 [55]. The differential expression analysis was first performed separately for each sex using default parameters. This analysis identified differentially expressed genes between the naive and CCI groups within males or females. The interaction of sex on differential gene expression after injury was evaluated by the interaction term included in the design matrix within DESeq2. All downstream analyses on RNA-seq data were performed on data obtained from DESeq2. An adjusted p-value (i.e., FDR) <\u20090.05 and an absolute log2 fold change >\u20090.5 were used to define differentially expressed transcripts between naive and injured animals. DESeq2 adjusts for multiple testing by implementing the procedures of Benjamini and Hochberg [55]. Genes with differential expression between groups were then included in pathway analysis to infer their functional roles and relationships.Gene ontology analysis for enriched biological processes in each set of differentially enriched genes identified by DESeq2 was performed using Metascape [http://metascape.org] [56] with a minimum enrichment of 1.0 and a p-value cutoff of 0.05. Metascape compiles data monthly from publicly available resources (e.g. NCBI, Reactome, GO, KEGG) to provide comprehensive analysis of a list of genes. All significant differentially enriched genes identified by DESeq2 were used to construct network-based functional associations using the GeneMANIA algorithm [57] as a plug-in within Cytoscape version 3.4.0 [58]. Raw and processed sequencing data has been deposited in the NCBI GEO database under accession #GEO100122.Total RNA extracted from DRGs of a separate cohort of rats was used to confirm the relationship of gene expression trends between sexes in selected genes by qPCR. As previously described, first-strand cDNA synthesis from 500\u2009ng total RNA in a 20\u2009\u03bcl reaction was performed using random hexamer primers and the SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. cDNA was diluted 1:4 with nuclease-free water and stored at \u2212\u200920\u2009\u00b0C. mRNA sequence for each gene was retrieved from NCBI. Forward and reverse primers for each gene were designed using the PrimerQuest Tool (IDT, Coralville, Iowa) to span one or more introns. Primers were obtained through Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, Iowa) and sequences are provided in Additional file 9.Each 20\u2009\u03bcl qPCR reaction consisted of 10ul 2X Power SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 200\u2009nM each forward and reverse primer, and 2\u2009\u03bcl diluted cDNA. PCR of each target was performed using the 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA) with the following thermocycling conditions: initial denaturation at 95\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min followed by 40\u2009cycles of 95\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009s and 60\u2009\u00b0C for 60\u2009s. Two biological replicates were assayed for each group and each biological replicate was run in triplicate for each target gene. Nuclease-free water was included in each plate as a no-template control.PCR efficiencies of each primer set were determined using the slope of standard curves constructed with Cq values obtained from 5-fold serial dilutions of pooled cDNA from DRGs of each group (e.g., male na\u00efve, female na\u00efve, male CCI, female CCI). The efficiency was calculated using they formula: E\u2009=\u200910\u20131/slope. Dissociation curve analysis was used to identify amplification of non-specific products including primer dimers.To identify a stable endogenous control gene for normalization of the target genes in qPCR we selected six candidate reference genes (i.e., Sdha, Hmbs, Polr2a, G6pd, Ywhaz, Actb) that showed little variation in the RNA-seq data. The expression stability of each candidate reference gene across groups was analyzed using the NormFinder function in R (https://www.moma.dk/normfinder-software) [59]. For each candidate gene, NormFinder (RRID: SCR_003387) calculates a stability value for each gene based on the genes expression variation among samples within the same group and variation between different group. This stability value enables candidate genes to be ranked according to their expression stability among different experimental conditions. The gene or pair of genes with the lowest stability value (i.e., highest expression stability) was selected as the endogenous control for relative gene expression calculations of each target gene.Several pairwise comparisons were performed. First, we compared gene expression in the DRGs from naive rats in male and females to identify transcripts that are expressed at significantly higher or lower levels than in the opposite sex. Then, we identified transcripts that were differentially regulated following injury compared with the naive tissue within the same sex (i.e., male CCI versus male naive tissue, female CCI versus female na\u00efve tissue). Last, we compared genes that were differentially regulated following injury between males and females.Default settings were used to define quantification cycle (Cq) values using SDS software version 2.4.1 (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA). The Cq values were averaged over three technical replicates. If the standard deviation of this average was >\u20090.20, the outlying replicate was removed and the Cq was averaged over the two remaining technical replicates. The 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT method was used to convert Cq values into relative gene expression for each gene [60].Adenosine TriphosphateChronic Constriction InjuryCentral Nervous SystemDermorphin [D-Arg2, Lys4 (1\u20134) amideDorsal Root GanglionFold ChangeFalse Discovery RateGene OntologyInterleukinMitogen-activated Protein KinaseMajor Histocompatibility ComplexMorphine Opioid ReceptorNicotinamide adenine dinucleotidePolymerase Chain ReactionPeripheral Nervous SystemRibonucleic AcidThis study was supported by the Blaustein Pain Research and Education Endowment (K.E.S., S.D.T.) and National Institutes of Health grants R01GM106024 (S.D.T.), R01GM118760 (S.D.T.), F32NR015728 (K.E.S.), R01NS070814 (Y.G.), and R21NS099879 (Y.G.), and R01HG006282 (H.J.).

Basic biological influences that regulate responses to nociceptive stimuli and the generation of chronic pain have largely been investigated using neuropathic pain models in rodents. In an effort to isolate the pain behaviors from other experimental procedures used to create the model the majority of these prior studies used sham procedures as a comparison group. In sham procedures, all experimental procedures are performed with the exception of nerve injury from mechanical manipulation or administration of an active compound. In the present study, we use na\u00efve animals as a comparison group so that we may capture all changes that are associated with clinical neuropathic pain conditions (e.g., skin incision, damage to nerve terminals, deep muscle tissue with associated inflammatory response).\n\nFig. 1\nSchematic diagram of experimental procedures. Male and female rats were randomly assigned to the na\u00efve group or receive CCI. Total RNA was isolated from the L4-L6 DRG of na\u00efve rats and on day 14 after CCI to the sciatic nerve. Libraries were constructed after poly(A) selection and sequenced. RNA-seq was performed on ipsilateral L4-L6 DRGs from each animal. Differentially expressed genes (DEG), defined as genes expressed after CCI versus na\u00efve with a |log2fold change (FC)|\u2009>\u20090.5 and an FDR\u2009<\u20090.05 were compared between male and female rats.

Expression levels of 14,403 genes were evaluated and the majority (13,541 genes; 94.0%) showed no significant difference in expression level between males and females (Fig. 2b). Of the 862 genes with expression levels that differed significantly between males and females, 652 (75.6%) showed increased in expression in males versus females and 210 (24.4%) showed increased expression in females versus males (Fig. 2c-d). Lists of these genes with increased and decreased expression in the DRGs between male and female rats are provided as Additional\u00a0file\u00a01 and Additional\u00a0file\u00a02. These male and female gene lists were then subject to gene ontology (GO) analysis using Metascape. GO pathways associated with genes that had relatively increased expression in the male naive DRG include Regulation of RNA splicing (GO:0043484), Schwann cell differentiation (GO:0014037), and Regulation of cell cycle process (GO:0010564) (Fig. 2e). GO pathways associated with genes that had relatively increased expression in the female naive DRG were different from that in males and include NADH dehydrogenase complex assembly (GO:0010257), ATP metabolic process (GO:0046034), and Antigen process and presentation of antigen via MHC class II (GO: 0002495).\n\nFig. 2\nSex differences of gene expression in DRGs from na\u00efve rats. a Schematic diagram of experiment.

DRG dorsal root ganglion\nTo determine the effects of peripheral nerve injury on gene expression in the DRGs of male rats, we evaluated RNA-seq data obtained 14\u2009days after CCI and compared these expression profiles to those from naive males (Fig.\u00a03a). Compared to naive DRGs, DRGs from male CCI rats differentially expressed 2824 genes (19.5%) (Fig. 3b). Of these 2824 differential genes, 1185 genes (42.0%) were upregulated after injury and 1639 genes (58.0%) were downregulated after injury (Fig. 3b). Despite the use of na\u00efve rats as the comparison group, we found that a large number of upregulated genes after CCI (e.g., Reg3b, Vgf, Atf3, Cacna2d1, Gal, Npy, Gap43) are the same as those previously reported to be upregulated in the DRG after nerve injury which used sham-operated rats as the comparison group [16, 18]. The top 25 upregulated and downregulated genes after CCI ranked by the false discovery rate (FDR) are listed in Table\u00a01 and Table\u00a02, respectively. GO analysis of the upregulated transcripts confirmed significant enrichment among nerve injury and pain related processes (Fig. 3c). A total of 38 genes were present in the three most significant GO biological processes and include voltage-gated ion channels (e.g., Cacna1a, Cacna1b, Cacna1e, Scn9a), ligand-gated ion channels (e.g., Chrnb2, Grin1, Htr3a), and G-protein coupled receptors (e.g., Cnr1, Npy2r, Oprm1) (Fig. 3d). Among the 652 genes that showed increased expression in DRGs of na\u00efve male rats compared to female na\u00efve rats, 549 genes (84.2%) were downregulated following CCI whereas only 7 genes (1.1%) were upregulated following CCI.\n\nFig. 3\nDifferential gene expression between CCI and na\u00efve groups in male rats. a Schematic diagram of experiment.

In comparison to naive DRGs, 817 (5.7%) genes were differentially regulated after nerve injury (Fig. 4b). Of these 817 differential genes, 471 genes (57.6%) were upregulated after injury and 346 genes (42.3%) were downregulated. The top 25 upregulated and downregulated genes after CCI ranked by DR are listed in Table\u00a03 and Table\u00a04, respectively. GO analysis identified that 2 of the top enriched GO biological processes in the differentially expressed genes in females are shared between males and females following nerve injury (i.e., Behavior (GO:0007610), Regulation of Ion Transport (GO:0043269); Fig. 4c). However, even though males and females share enrichment in these biological processes, just 20 and 23% of these genes are common to both males and females (Additional\u00a0file\u00a03). A total of 130 genes show enrichment in the \u201cPositive regulation of nervous system development\u201d GO biological process and include genes that encode for cytokines (e.g., Il6, Il1r1), chemokines (e.g., Cxcl13, Cxcl9), and enzymes (e.g., Doux2, Gch1, Tnik) (Fig. 4d). Among the 210 genes with increased expression in naive DRGs of female rats compared to the na\u00efve male rats, 30 (14.2%) were downregulated and 4 (1.9%) were upregulated following CCI.\n\nFig. 4\nDifferential gene expression between CCI and na\u00efve groups in female rats. a Schematic diagram of experiment.

We first visualized the extent of similarity/dissimilarity in the transcriptional profiles of the individual samples using the first two principal components from principal component analysis of all genes (Fig. 5b). The first two principal components accounted for a total of 79% of the total variance among the samples and produced distinct clusters of the samples by treatment condition (i.e., naive, CCI) and sex. This segregation of samples was confirmed by hierarchical clustering of the top 200 genes that showed the greatest variability across all groups (Fig. 5c). Of the 3127 genes that were differentially regulated between males and females, only 514 genes (16.4%) were common to both males and females regardless of direction of transcriptional changes (Fig. 5d).\n\nFig. 5\nComparison of differential gene expression between CCI and na\u00efve groups in male and female rats. a Schematic diagram of experiment.

Of the 1185 genes that were upregulated in males, 321 (27.1%) were also upregulated in females. We used GeneMANIA to identify functional pathways enriched in this gene set (Fig. 6c). The top functional pathways identified in this set of upregulated genes were Sensory Perception of Pain, Regulation of Neuron Projection Development, and Negative Regulation of Cell Projection Organization.\n\nFig. 6\nGene ontology in differentially expressed genes that are upregulated after CCI. a Schematic diagram of experiment.

We first identified an appropriate endogenous control gene by evaluating 6 candidate reference genes that showed the most stable gene expression among na\u00efve and injured DRG of both sexes. The NormFinder algorithm calculated the lowest stability score for Hmbs which is consistent with stable expression among conditions (Table\u00a05). Due to missing data from one sample Ywhaz could not be included in this analysis. The relative changes in gene expression derived by qPCR were in agreement with those detected by RNA-seq.Table 5\nStability values of candidate reference genes in the DRG as determined by NormFinder\nWe also identify many growth factors, hormones, cytokines, and neurotransmitters that are differentially up- and downregulated following CCI in males and/or females. Once these molecules bind their cognate receptors on cell membranes, they induce kinase and phosphatase activity in signal transduction cascades which can ultimately modify the expression of specific transcription factors and their respective target genes. Indeed, many of the sex-specific expression differences we identified were in genes that produce key proteins in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (Fig.\u00a07). Alterations of the MAPK pathways are associated with the development of pain hypersensitivity (for review see [38, 39]). Prior studies have attributed MAPK signaling within DRG cells to pain phenotypes ([40\u201342]). However, sex-based differences were not considered in these studies. For example, a study that examined CCI in male rats found that Jun (c-Jun, V-Jun avian sarcoma virus 17 oncogene homolog) is upregulated in the DRG after CCI and associated with increased expression of proteins that contribute to mechanisms involved in neuropathic pain (e.g., neuropeptide Y, vasoactive intestinal peptide) [43]. While our results are consistent with this study, we found that Jun expression was 1.4 times greater in females than males. We also found that expression of Fos (FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog) was also significantly upregulated in females after CCI, but downregulated in males. Since c-Jun and c-fos combine to form the AP-1 early response transcription factor, sex-specific differences in the activity of AP-1 may contribute to the differential gene expression observed after CCI.\n\nFig. 7\nModified KEGG map of the JNK and p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway showing transcriptional changes.

(XLSX 13 kb)", "s12864-019-5522-7": "Carbonic anhydrase (CA) catalyzes the hydration of CO2 in the first biochemical step of C4 photosynthesis, and has been considered a potentially rate-limiting step when CO2 availability within a leaf is low. Previous work in Zea mays (maize) with a double knockout of the two highest-expressed \u03b2-CA genes, CA1 and CA2, reduced total leaf CA activity to less than 3% of wild-type. Surprisingly, this did not limit photosynthesis in maize at ambient or higher CO2concentrations. However, the ca1ca2 mutants exhibited reduced rates of photosynthesis at sub-ambient CO2, and accumulated less biomass when grown under sub-ambient CO2 (9.2\u2009Pa). To further clarify the importance of CA for C4 photosynthesis, we assessed gene expression changes in wild-type, ca1 and ca1ca2 mutants in response to changes in pCO2 from 920 to 9.2\u2009Pa.Leaf samples from each genotype were collected for RNA-seq analysis at high CO2 and at two time points after the low CO2 transition, in order to identify early and longer-term responses to CO2 deprivation. Despite the existence of multiple isoforms of CA, no other CA genes were upregulated in CA mutants. Although photosynthetic genes were downregulated in response to low CO2, differential expression was not observed between genotypes. However, multiple indicators of carbon starvation were present in the mutants, including amino acid synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, and sugar signaling. In particular, multiple genes previously implicated in low carbon stress such as asparagine synthetase, amino acid transporters, trehalose-6-phosphate synthase, as well as many transcription factors, were strongly upregulated. Furthermore, genes in the CO2 stomatal signaling pathway were differentially expressed in the CA mutants under low CO2.Using a transcriptomic approach, we showed that carbonic anhydrase mutants do not compensate for the lack of CA activity by upregulating other CA or photosynthetic genes, but rather experienced extreme carbon stress when grown under low CO2. Our results also support a role for CA in the CO2 stomatal signaling pathway. This study provides insight into the importance of CA for C4 photosynthesis and its role in stomatal signaling.Carbonic anhydrase (CA) is a ubiquitous enzyme across all kingdoms of life, catalyzing the reversible hydration of CO2 into bicarbonate [1]. In plants, the \u03b2-subtype of CA is often present in large quantities and has long been implicated in photosynthesis [2]. The role of \u03b2-CA in C3 plants remains somewhat ambiguous, with reports that CA makes up a significant portion of leaf protein, but \u03b2-CA knockdowns show little photosynthetic phenotype [3, 4]. In C3 plants, \u03b2-CA is primarily found in the chloroplast and the prevailing hypothesis is that it facilitates diffusion of CO2 across the chloroplast envelope [1]. In contrast, \u03b2-CA is primarily localized to the mesophyll cytosol in C4 plants, where it produces bicarbonate for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) in the first committed step of the CO2 concentrating mechanism.Various modeling studies and mutant analyses have been employed to assess the role of \u03b2-CA for C4 photosynthesis. For example, modeling the apparent in vivo CA activity extrapolated from in vitro enzyme assays suggested that CA may be near-limiting for C4 photosynthesis [5]. Subsequent mutant analyses in the C4 dicot Flaveria bidentis found that CA was in excess for photosynthesis, as CO2 assimilation was unaffected until CA levels reached <\u200920% of wild-type [6, 7]. However, C4 monocots such as maize had previously been shown to have naturally low levels of CA activity [8], suggesting that CA may be limiting in these plants. To address this question, Studer et al. [9] knocked out the two highest-expressed \u03b2-CA genes in maize (Ca1 and Ca2). Surprisingly, a 97% reduction of wild-type CA activity resulted in plants capable of maintaining wild-type rates of photosynthesis at ambient and above partial pressures of CO2 (pCO2), with significant reductions in photosynthesis occurring only under sub-ambient pCO2. RNAi knockdowns of CA to ~\u200910% of wild-type in Setaria viridis showed similar results [10]. Taken together, it appears that CA activity is in excess for what is needed to drive photosynthesis in C4 plants under ambient pCO2. However, these results do not provide a satisfactory explanation for the overabundance of CA in C4 leaves, and also do not indicate if CA mutants are able to compensate through alternate means of enhancing CO2 diffusion and bicarbonate availability.In addition to photosynthesis, CA has been shown to serve diverse roles in plant metabolism. Isoforms of \u03b1 and \u03b3 CA subtypes identified in plants are primarily expressed in non-photosynthetic tissue. The function of \u03b1-CA in higher plants is not known [11]. Similarly, the role of \u03b3-CA is not well understood, although mutant analyses in Arabidopsis thaliana have implicated \u03b3-CAs in the assembly of Complex I in the mitochondrial electron transport chain and suggested roles for \u03b3-CAs in light-dependent development and photorespiration [12\u201314]. Although \u03b2-CAs are primarily considered for their photosynthetic role, isoforms of \u03b2-CAs in C3 plants have also been implicated in lipid biosynthesis [15], stomatal responses to CO2 [16, 17], recapture of photorespired CO2 [14, 18], and amino acid biosynthesis [19]. Furthermore, recent work in C4 plants has suggested a link between \u03b2-CA, nitrogen metabolites, and photosynthesis [20], and a role for \u03b2-CA in stomatal movement [21]. Therefore, \u03b2-CAs may serve in a variety of roles in C4 plants.To further evaluate the role of \u03b2-CA in the C4 plant maize, RNA-seq was performed on ca1 and ca1ca2 mutants to test the transcript-level effect of CA limitation under high and low pCO2. We hypothesized that CA mutants would upregulate other CA isoforms, photosynthetic genes, or genes influencing CO2 diffusion into the leaf in order to compensate for the CA limitation. This experiment also provided an opportunity to evaluate the potential role of \u03b2-CA in non-photosynthetic roles in a C4 plant. Overall, our results provide new insights into the role of \u03b2-CA in maize and mechanisms of low CO2 adaptation in CA-limited plants.RNA-seq was performed on wild-type and ca1 and ca1ca2 mutant alleles (described previously in [9]) in order to evaluate the effect of CA limitation on transcriptional responses to low CO2. Plants were initially grown at 920\u2009Pa (10,000\u2009ppm) CO2 as previously described [9] to minimize growth differences between genotypes. To verify that genotypes were similar under the high CO2 growth conditions, leaf samples were taken for RNA-seq after 12\u2009days at 920\u2009Pa. After the CO2 levels were reduced to 9.2\u2009Pa (100\u2009ppm), two additional time points were sampled to capture rapid and longer-term response differences between genotypes to reduced CO2 availability.The ca1ca2 mutants were more strongly affected by the first day at low CO2 than ca1 mutant plants, as evidenced by their separation in the PCA as well as the number of differentially expressed genes (Fig. 1b). Again, the differentially expressed genes of ca1 mutants were not significantly enriched in any GO terms; however, ca1ca2 mutants were enriched in many stress responses, signaling, carbohydrate metabolism, and cellulose biosynthesis genes. After two days at low CO2 (\u201cLow2\u201d), both ca1 and ca1ca2 mutants were clearly distinct from wild-type in the PCA and many genes were differentially expressed (Fig. 1b). In both mutant genotypes, the differentially expressed genes at Low2 were enriched in GO categories including carbohydrate metabolism, cellulose biosynthesis, trehalose biosynthesis, stress responses, epidermis development, and organic acid metabolism (Additional file 1).Five genes were differentially expressed in the ca1 and ca1ca2 mutants across all conditions. However, these five genes were unresponsive to CO2, and located on the same chromosome as ca1 and ca2 (chromosome 3). Differential expression of these genes was determined to be an artifact of backcrossing the W22-based mutant into a B73 background. Due to linkage, homozygous mutant plants have W22 alleles of genes adjacent to the Ca locus and the wild-type plants have B73 alleles. The differential expression of these five genes in a W22 and B73 background is consistent with the expression measured by [22].Aquaporins have been implicated in mediating CO2 diffusion across membranes in various plant species [23]. However, no aquaporin genes were consistently upregulated in mutant plants at low pCO2. In ca1ca2 mutants, ZmPIP1;2 (AC209208.3_FG002) was upregulated and ZmPIP2;5 (GRMZM2G178693) was downregulated. In contrast, only ZmPIP1;6 (GRMZM2G136032) was significantly differentially expressed in ca1 mutants and was downregulated at low pCO2. Interestingly, the expression patterns of the various maize aquaporin genes in response to CO2 varied, with some increasing at low CO2 and others decreasing (Additional file 4). Expression of ZmPIP1;2 increased steadily in response to CO2, with expression in the ca1ca2 mutants surpassing wild-type at the second low CO2 time point. In contrast, ZmPIP2;5 exhibited an expression pattern similar to the photosynthetic genes \u2013 relatively constant between the high CO2 and first low CO2 time point, but sharply reduced after two days at low CO2. Localization data for the mesophyll and bundle sheath provides additional insight into the potential function of these aquaporin genes. ZmPIP1;2 and ZmPIP1;6 are found in both cell types, whereas ZmPIP2;5 is primarily localized to the bundle sheath [24].Among the genes differentially expressed in both genotypes at low CO2 were several groups characteristic of carbon starvation responses. Four genes likely encoding trehalose phosphate synthase (TPS) were expressed significantly higher in both ca1 and ca1ca2 mutants at low CO2. Interestingly, these TPS genes were expressed at similar levels at high CO2 in all genotypes, and were generally downregulated in response to low CO2 in wild-type plants. However, the mutant plants either maintained or increased expression levels of several TPS genes in response to low CO2 (Additional file 5).Multiple genes relating to starch and sucrose synthesis were also differentially expressed in ca mutants under low pCO2. In general, genes involved in the breakdown and mobilization of sucrose, including SWEET transporters and sucrose synthase, were upregulated. The sucrose synthase breakdown pathway, driven by shrunken1 in maize, has lower energetic costs and tends to be favored under energy limited conditions [25]. Two genes encoding glucose-6-phosphate translocators were significantly downregulated in the mutants. Furthermore, genes involved in starch synthesis were likewise downregulated. Overall these results are consistent with decreased carbon supply and decreased investment into the starch and sucrose pathways in the mutant plants relative to wild-type under low CO2 (Additional file 4).Another metabolic process affected by low CO2 in the mutants, consistent with a carbon starvation response, was cell wall synthesis and growth. Four isoforms of cellulose synthase, three isoforms of \u03b2-galactosidase, and three isoforms of endoglucanase were significantly downregulated in ca1 and ca1ca2 mutants compared to wild-type plants at low CO2 (Additional file 4). Interestingly, several genes encoding homologs of expansin-like genes from Arabidopsis were upregulated at low CO2 in ca1ca2 mutants.Twelve genes that were found to be either differentially expressed or responsive to CO2 in the RNA-seq analysis were validated with qRT-PCR. The log2-fold change between mutant and wild-type was calculated for each condition and compared to the log2-fold change calculated using edgeR in the RNA-seq analysis. Similar results were observed using both methods (Additional file 8). The log2-fold change values generated by qPCR and RNA-seq were significantly correlated (p\u2009<\u20092e\u2212\u200916, R2\u2009=\u20090.82; Additional file 9). All genes which were differentially expressed in one or more condition showed similar patterns in the qRT-PCR data. Additionally, we included one gene that was not differentially expressed in the RNA-seq data (PEPC); this result was also confirmed in the qRT-PCR results. Furthermore, patterns of CO2responsiveness were consistent between the qRT-PCR and RNA-seq data (Additional file 10). Thus, the observed gene expression trends are supported by two orthogonal methods providing strong evidence for the observed results.Consistent with previous observations that ca mutants grow normally under high CO2, both ca1 and ca1ca2 mutants clustered with wild-type plants in the principal component analysis and there were only a few genes differentially expressed between genotypes at high CO2. As noted by the GO enrichment analysis, the ca1ca2 mutants differentially express many transcription factors at high CO2; however, these genes are uncharacterized in maize and have unknown functions. Only 19 genes were differentially expressed in both genotypes at high CO2, indicating that the mutations had a minor effect on gene expression at high CO2. Importantly, no photosynthetic genes aside from ca1 and ca2 were affected at high CO2.One of the goals of this study was to identify both the short-term and longer-term responses to low CO2 in ca mutants. At the first low CO2 time point, expression of many genes was affected in the ca mutants; however, this effect was relatively small in the ca1 mutants compared to the ca1ca2 mutants. This result is surprising considering that ca1 contributes to approximately 90% of bulk leaf CA activity, while ca2 makes up only 7% of bulk leaf CA activity. The results of Studer et al. [9] and the significant differences in the temporal response of ca1 and ca1ca2 genotypes to low CO2 suggest at least a partial subfunctionalization of the two CA genes. Indeed, despite their small reduction in CA activity, ca2 mutants have altered stomatal conductance [21]. The role of ca2 in stomatal signaling is further supported by gene expression changes in ca1ca2 mutants at the first low CO2 time point. In Arabidopsis, CA functions in stomatal signaling by modulating the bicarbonate concentration in guard cells in response to CO2. Under high CO2, the corresponding high bicarbonate concentration in the guard cells is sensed by a MATE transporter, RESISTANT to HIGH CO2 1 (RHC1), which then binds and sequesters the kinase HIGH LEAF TEMPERATURE 1 (HT1) to the plasma membrane [27, 28]. The bound HT1 releases the kinase OPEN STOMATA1 (OST1) to trigger stomatal closure through activation of the S-type anion channel SLOW ANION CHANNEL-ASSOCIATED1 (SLAC1) [29, 30]. Since CA functions in the initial step of the CO2 signaling pathway through modulating bicarbonate concentrations, any effect of the ca1 and ca1ca2 mutants on CO2 signaling should be seen in differential expression of these downstream CO2 signaling genes. Indeed, homologs of the downstream CO2 signaling genes in our study were responsive to CO2 as expected and differentially expressed in the ca1ca2 but not ca1 mutants. The maize homolog of SLAC1 (GRMZM2G106921) is strongly downregulated in ca1ca2 mutants compared to wild-type at the first low CO2 time point, although it returns to wild-type levels after two days at low CO2. The strong downregulation in ca1ca2 mutants relative to wild-type indicates that ca1ca2 plants adjust expression of CO2-sensitive stomata genes to relieve SLAC1-driven stomatal closure while adjusting for the CO2 signaling bottleneck due to low CA activity. The ca1 mutants showed a similar, but non-significant, expression pattern for SLAC1. In addition to SLAC1, two isoforms of OST1 were downregulated in response to CO2, with more pronounced downregulation in the mutants compared to wild-type. One isoform of OST1(GRMZM2G066867) was downregulated at the first day of low CO2, whereas the second isoform (GRMZM2G081915) was downregulated at the second time point. Since OST1 functions in activating SLAC1 and therefore inducing stomatal closure, downregulation of OST1 would be expected to enhance stomatal opening in the mutants. Interestingly, this effect is seen at the first low CO2 time point. We hypothesize that the expression level is altered in response to changing CO2, but after acclimating to the condition over several days, the plants achieve a steady-state expression level similar to wild-type. This hypothesis would explain why altered expression levels are not observed when the plants are grown at high CO2, and are largely resolved after two days at low CO2. Although these results support a role for CA in the stomatal CO2 signaling pathway, there is still debate in the literature about whether the CO2 signal comes exclusively from the guard cells or whether it is also influenced by a mesophyll signal such as Ci, sucrose, malate, or other metabolites [31]. It is unclear whether the changes in gene expression of stomatal genes may be affected by a mesophyll signal reflecting reduced photosynthetic rate in the mutants under low CO2. Additional study on these mutants may provide insight into the contribution of mesophyll and guard cell signals for stomatal responses to CO2.After two days at 9.2\u2009Pa CO2, changes in photosynthetic metabolism were evident across all genotypes, but interestingly, relatively few differences were observed between the genotypes. One of our hypotheses was that CA mutant plants upregulated other isoforms of CA or enzymes in the C4 pathway to compensate for low CA activity. However, our RNA-seq analysis showed that none of the other CA isoforms found in leaves were upregulated in CA mutants relative to wild-type, indicating that the plants were unable to compensate for the mutation. This result is in contrast to previous work on the carbon concentrating mechanism of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which identified multiple isoforms of CA that were induced by low CO2 [32]. Interestingly, however, one of the predicted mitochondrial \u03b2-CAs (GRMZM2G414528) strongly increases in expression in response to CO2, independent of genotype. This result supports the proposed role for mitochondrial CAs in respiratory/photorespiratory CO2 recycling [14]. Although photorespiratory genes generally decreased at low CO2, many respiratory genes increased in expression at low CO2 (Additional file 11). Similar results have been observed for mitochondrial CA in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii when transitioning cells from high to low CO2, suggesting an anaplerotic role for mitochondrial CA [33, 34].Photosynthetic metabolism is significantly changed by differences in the availability of atmospheric CO2, but surprisingly few photosynthetic genes were differentially expressed between genotypes. However, genes involved in light reactions, photorespiration, as well as the C3 and C4 cycles were all downregulated at low CO2, regardless of genotype. In general, the ca mutants tended to downregulate these genes to a larger extent than wild-type plants; although for most genes this trend was not significant after two days at low CO2. Interestingly, the only core C3 cycle gene found to be upregulated in the experiment was Rubisco activase (GRMZM2G162282) in ca1 mutants. A similar trend was observed in ca1ca2 mutants, although the difference was not significant (FDR\u2009=\u20090.087). In all genotypes, the small subunit of Rubisco was downregulated in response to low CO2. This indicates that under low carbon availability, plants may alter the activation state of Rubisco, while reducing the total protein content to conserve resources. Downregulation of light reaction genes is expected to account for the light stress associated with low CO2 availability. The downregulation of photorespiratory genes along with the C4 and C3 cycles is indicative of the precise balancing of these cycles such that photorespiration is minimized even under these low CO2 conditions.Aquaporins have been shown to mediate CO2 diffusion in several plant species [23]. In particular, CO2-transporting aquaporins have been implicated in mesophyll conductance [35\u201337], which is defined as the movement of CO2 from the intercellular air spaces to the site of initial carboxylation in the mesophyll. In C3 plants, CA is thought to enhance mesophyll conductance directly by facilitating diffusion of CO2 through the chloroplast stroma [1]. Alternatively, in C4 plants, mesophyll conductance is defined as the movement of CO2 to the sites of carboxylation by PEPC, which also requires the CA-catalyzed CO2 hydration to bicarbonate. Previous work has demonstrated that high CA activity is important to offset low mesophyll conductance, particularly under CO2-limiting conditions [38, 39]. Therefore, aquaporins may play an important role in mediating CO2 diffusion upstream of CA and we hypothesized that CA mutants may increase expression of CO2-transporting aquaporins to offset low CA activity for mesophyll conductance.Currently, the aquaporin isoforms in maize that are responsible for CO2 movement have not been characterized. In our study, three aquaporin genes (AC209208.3_FG002, GRMZM2G178693, GRMZM2G136032) were differentially expressed at low CO2 in one of the two mutant genotypes. However, these genes did not have a consistent response to CO2, indicating that their physiological roles likely differ. Distinct physiological roles are also supported by differences in mesophyll/bundle sheath localization. This may be reflective of some aquaporin genes being involved in CO2 movement, whereas others may be responding to changes in water availability due to stomatal opening at low CO2. Since no aquaporin was consistently upregulated in the mutant plants, our results do not support an increase in mesophyll conductance via CO2-transporting aquaporins as a mechanism to enhance CO2 availability in CA mutants.In spite of few differences between CA mutant plants and wild-type in genes enhancing CO2 uptake or photosynthesis, the gene expression data presents a clear pattern that the CA mutants were experiencing low carbon stress. This is consistent with previous work showing a reduction in photosynthesis under sub-ambient CO2 [9]. Carbon starvation responses are often characterized by changes in carbohydrate metabolism and allocation of photoassimilate into organic acids [40, 41]. Various studies have implicated trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) and associated metabolites including trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) as a critical signal for sugar levels that potentially interacts with various other upstream and downstream pathways [42\u201345]. In this study, wild-type plants decreased expression of multiple isoforms of TPS at low CO2. This is expected, as previous studies have shown low levels of T6P in carbon-starved Arabidopsis seedlings [46]. In contrast, both ca1 and ca1ca2 mutants either maintain relatively constant TPS expression across all CO2 conditions, or even upregulate TPS at low CO2. This pattern is somewhat paradoxical given other evidence suggesting carbon starvation in CA mutant plants; however, we hypothesize that CA mutant plants utilize TPS to reprogram carbohydrate and organic acid metabolism in response to the extreme carbon starvation they experience at low CO2.Many studies have linked TPS to reprogramming of carbohydrate metabolism, particularly in the context of carbon starvation. Early work on T6P and sugar signaling in Arabidopsis led to the conclusion that T6P is critical for proper use of carbohydrates and growth [43]. Schluepmann et al. [43] discussed their findings in the context of similar work in yeast, and hypothesized that T6P may have evolved as a way to regulate glycolysis to handle sudden and large changes in carbohydrate availability, contributing to organisms\u2019 versatility in handling diverse environmental conditions. Since then, a clear link between T6P, sucrose, and organic acid metabolism has emerged [45]. Specifically, T6P appears to act both as a sugar signal as well as a negative feedback regulator of sucrose; high levels of sucrose lead to an increase of T6P, which in turn stimulates consumption of sucrose [47]. Furthermore, recent work has also shown that induction of TPS is associated with altered partitioning of photoassimilate, promoting carbon flux into organic acids [45]. The mechanism linking TPS to organic acids is less well understood, although there is some evidence that T6P may activate nitrate reductase, affecting nitrogen uptake, or PEPC, affecting respiratory flux [45]. Yet additional studies have suggested a role for T6P in stomatal opening [44]. Our results suggest that ca1 and ca1ca2 mutants do not regulate TPS as expected for carbon starvation. Instead, the high levels of TPS, expected to confer high levels of T6P, may indicate a reprogramming of primary metabolism in mutant plants, stimulating sucrose consumption for growth and altering photoassimilate partitioning into organic acids with high N:C to conserve carbon resources.Investment in high N:C organic acids are a classic symptom of carbon starvation, as observed in several metabolite studies [40, 41]. These organic acids typically include asparagine and arginine, although results have been inconsistent between studies. In our study, two genes encoding asparagine synthetase were strongly upregulated, as well as aspartate aminotransferase which is an essential step in synthesizing asparagine. In addition, asparaginase (an enzyme which degrades asparagine) was downregulated and homologs of transcription factors characterized in Arabidopsis as regulating asparagine synthetase were upregulated. Furthermore, the isoform of aspartate aminotransferase upregulated in this experiment is not expected to have a role in C4 photosynthesis; in contrast, the C4 isoform was strongly downregulated at low CO2. The upregulation of multiple genes with putative functions in amino acid transport also suggests that plants were actively engaging in remobilization of nitrogen in response to low CO2. Overall, these findings are consistent with an investment in amino acids with a high N:C ratio for remobilization of nitrogen. Although recent work in Arabidopsis has suggested a role for CA in amino acid metabolism [19], we did not observe significant differences in the biosynthesis of other amino acids. Therefore, our results are most consistent with a remobilization of nitrogen in energy efficient amino acids, rather than a direct role for CA in amino acid synthesis.RNA-seq analysis of ca1 and ca1ca2 mutant plants in response to low CO2 found that despite experiencing reductions in photosynthetic capacity under low CO2 due to CA limitation, CA mutant plants do not compensate by upregulating other CA genes or genes involved in CO2 uptake or assimilation. However, CA mutant plants had altered expression of genes in the CO2 stomatal signaling pathway consistent with previous work demonstrating abnormal stomatal responses in CA mutants. These findings support a similar CO2 signaling pathway in maize as was previously described in the C3 dicot Arabidopsis thaliana. CA mutant plants also exhibited typical signs of carbon starvation, including sugar signaling and amino acid metabolism. This work identified previously uncharacterized transcription factors which may function to regulate metabolic responses to carbon starvation. Future work on the other isoforms of CA will provide additional insight into the role of CA in photosynthesis and stomatal signaling in maize.Maize lines carrying the mutant alleles ca1-m1::Ds and ca1-d1ca2-m1::Ds (generated and provided by A. Studer; previously described in [9]) in a W22 background were crossed to the reference line B73. These F1 plants were then backcrossed to B73 for two additional generations prior to selfing. This resulted in BC2S1 kernels segregating wild-type and ca1 and ca1ca2 mutant alleles. Kernels were germinated and grown in deep-well plug trays (Hummert #11\u20138606-1), in a controlled-environment growth chamber (Biochambers; TPC-19) at a photosynthetic photon flux density of 500\u2009\u03bcmol\u2009m\u2212\u20092\u2009s\u2212\u20091 at plant height, approximately 50% relative humidity, air temperature of 31\u2009\u00b0C/22\u2009\u00b0C\u2009day/night with a 16-h\u2009day. On the 7th day after planting (DAP), homozygous and wild-type seedlings were identified using the PCR assay described in Studer et al. [9]. The pCO2 in the chamber was initially 920\u2009Pa (10,000\u2009ppm) during the photoperiod. On the 12th DAP, the pCO2 in the chamber was reduced to 9.2\u2009Pa (100\u2009ppm) in the final hours of the photoperiod and maintained during the photoperiod for the remainder of the experiment.Leaf samples for RNA were taken three hours after the beginning of the photoperiod on days 12, 13 and 15. Each genotype/time-point combination was sampled in triplicate, with each of these three biological replicates containing a pool of leaves from four individual plants. Leaf samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u2212\u200980\u2009\u00b0C until extraction.Leaf tissue was ground in a Fluid Management Harbil 5G-HD paint shaker. Total RNA from the pooled samples of each line was isolated using TriPure reagent according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Invitrogen), and resuspended in 1x RNA Secure solution (Ambion). Library preparation was performed according to the strand-specific protocol developed by Wang et al. [48], resulting in three libraries per genotype/time-point combination for a total of 36 libraries. Libraries were sequenced on two lanes of an Illumina HiSeq2000 (Cornell University), generating 50-bp single-end reads. All libraries were sequenced on both lanes to account for lane effects.Raw Illumina reads from RNA-seq libraries were de-multiplexed using standard Casava settings. Reads were trimmed using TrimGalore [49] with a stringency of 2 and default settings. Trimmed reads were aligned to the maize reference genome B73 AGPv3 (Ensembl) using Bowtie v2.2.5.0 [50] and TopHat2 v2.1.0 [51]. Minimum and maximum intron length were 5 and 60,000\u2009bp, respectively; all other parameters were set to default values. Raw read counts were generated using htseq-count in union mode [52]. After verifying no significant effect of sequencing lane by principal component analysis, the data from each lane were merged in subsequent steps. Lowly expressed genes were filtered using edgeR [53], keeping genes with counts-per-million >\u20091 in at least three samples. Normalization factors for library sizes were calculated using standard methods. The quasi-likelihood negative binomial generalized log-linear model in edgeR (glmQLFit) was used to fit a model with two sets of mutants and two wild-types as treatments, while downstream a priori contrasts were conducted to statistically test differences in expression between groups of interest. Gene ontology enrichment was evaluated using the R package GOstats [54]. RNA-seq data have been deposited in the NCBI SRA (SRP133928).Sequencing of biological triplicates for all genotypes at each time point yielded on average 30.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.0 million reads per genotype:treatment combination. After quality control and adapter trimming, an average of 95.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1% reads mapped to the B73 reference genome. Differential expression was determined at a false-discovery rate of 0.05.Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on 12 genes which were either differentially expressed or showed a CO2 response in the RNA-seq data. These included SLAC1, three aquaporins, aspartate aminotransferase, two asparagine synthetases, PEPC, TPS, and three transcription factors. Gene IDs and primer sequences are provided in Additional file 12. Primers for each gene were designed using Roche\u2019s Universal ProbeLibrary Assay Design center. The original RNA samples were treated using DNaseI (NEB M0303) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions followed by an ethanol precipitation, and quantified with a Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen). cDNA synthesis was performed using the qScript cDNA synthesis kit (Quantabio) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions with 1\u2009\u03bcg of DNase-treated RNA. The reference gene for normalization (GRMZM2G046402) was selected using the leaf gradient RNA-seq data from Wang et al. [55] because it did not vary with leaf development. Expression of this gene from RNA-seq was consistent across all samples, supporting its use as a reference gene.qPCR was performed on a QuantStudio 7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using qScript cDNA SuperMix (Quantabio) and standard cycling conditions. Standard curves were generated from a 7-point serial dilution for each primer set to determine assay efficiency and analyzed using the Applied Biosystems Standard Curve Analysis Module. Estimated efficiency was between 90 and 110% for all primer sets. Expression levels were estimated using the relative standard curve method. Reactions were performed in triplicate, and technical replicates were averaged prior to normalizing by the reference gene. For one gene, GRMZM2G078472, several samples did not amplify during the 40-cycle qPCR run. This is expected given the low expression levels observed in the RNA-seq data. In these cases, a Cq value of 40 was imputed to allow for calculations of log2-fold change.Carbonic anhydrasegene ontologyHIGH LEAF TEMPERATURE 1OPEN STOMATA 1Phosphoenolpyruvate CarboxylaseRESISTANT to HIGH CO2 1Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenaseSLOW ANION CHANNEL-ASSOCIATED 1Trehalose-6-phosphateTrehalose-6-phosphate synthaseThis research was supported by the Office of Biological and Environmental Research in the DOE Office of Science DE-SC0008769 (ABC), a Department of Energy - Division of Biosciences Fellowship of the Life Sciences Research Foundation DE-FG02-12ER16337 (AJS), and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, under award number 2017\u201367011-26024 (ARK).The data generated and analyzed during the current study are available in the NCBI SRA repository (SRP133928).Not applicableNot applicableThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Principal component analysis of log2-transformed reads showed that the CO2 treatment had the strongest effect on gene expression (PC1: 37%), whereas the genotype corresponded to the second principal component (11% of variance) (Fig.\u00a01a). All genotypes were tightly clustered at high CO2 (\u201cHigh\u201d), consistent with previous findings that high CO2 rescues the CA mutant phenotype [9]. Under high CO2 conditions, ca1ca2 mutant plants had 170 significantly differentially expressed genes, whereas the ca1 mutant plants had 42 differentially expressed genes. Of these, 19 differentially expressed genes were shared between the genotypes. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment found no significant GO term enrichment in ca1 mutants at high CO2, but the ca1ca2 mutants were enriched in genes involved in regulation of gene expression (GO:0010468).\n\nFig. 1\nPrincipal component analysis of log-transformed reads (a) and Venn Diagram indicating statistically significant differentially expressed genes (b) in both low CO2 time points in ca1 and ca1ca2 mutant plants relative to wild-type. Differential expression was determined by an FDR cutoff of 0.05 using the quasi-likelihood negative binomial generalized log-linear model in edgeR\nTranscripts accumulated for both ca1 and ca2 in the mutant genotypes as expected due to the location of the Ds element in ca2 and the footprint allele in ca1 [9], although in most cases ca1 and ca2 expression was statistically reduced in the mutants (Table\u00a01). However, previous work showed significant reductions in CA activity in ca1 and ca1ca2 mutants [9] despite transcription of the majority of the gene. As previously described in Studer et al. [9], Ca3 was incorrectly annotated as part of Ca2 in the AGPv3 assembly. However, Ca3 is lowly expressed in leaf tissue, and visualization of the gene region in IGV shows no up-regulation of the gene in ca1 or ca1ca2 mutants (Additional file 2). The apparent down-regulation of Ca3 in mutant plants is most likely artefactual and due to misalignment of Ca1 and Ca2 sequences, as Ca3 has very high sequence homology to these other CA genes. Since fewer Ca1 and Ca2 transcripts are present in mutant plants, there are fewer reads aligning to Ca3 as well. Although there are three additional genes encoding \u03b2-CAs in maize leaf tissue, none of these were up-regulated in the mutants (Table 1). Consistent with previous reports showing no change in activity of the key photosynthetic enzymes PEPC or Rubisco in ca1 or ca1ca2 mutant plants compared to wild-type [9], there was no evidence of compensation in the expression of C3 or C4 cycle components in either mutant genotype, regardless of the pCO2 during the sampling. In fact, when significant differences were observed, these genes tended to have lower expression compared to wild-type at low CO2 (Additional file 3). Similarly, genes encoding photorespiratory enzymes were not differentially expressed between mutants and wild-type plants, although these genes tended to be downregulated at low pCO2 in all genotypes.Table 1\nLog-fold change and significance values of \u03b2-carbonic anhydrases found in leaf tissue in ca1 and ca1ca2 mutant plants at each CO2 condition. Significantly differentially expressed genes were defined as FDR\u2009<\u20090.05\nCarbonic anhydrase has previously been shown to function in the stomata to initiate stomatal responses to CO2. The CO2-sensing pathway of stomata has been characterized in Arabidopsis thaliana, but it is not well known whether monocots or C4 species use a similar signaling pathway. Similar to what was previously shown in Arabidopsis [16], ca1 and ca1ca2 mutants have altered stomatal conductance and responsiveness [21]. Therefore, we hypothesized that downstream components of the CO2 signaling pathway are likely conserved in maize. Homologs of the genes in the CO2 pathway from Arabidopsis were identified and used to evaluate the downstream effects of CA knockouts on stomatal signaling genes. Genes downstream of CA in the stomatal CO2 signaling pathway altered their expression in response to changing CO2 as expected. In addition, several genes involved in the CO2 sensing mechanism of the stomata were differentially expressed between ca mutants and wild-type plants (Fig.\u00a02). Other components of the CO2 signaling pathway, including RHC1 and HT1, responded as expected to drive stomatal opening (Fig. 2), but differential expression was not observed between genotypes.\n\nFig. 2\nExpression patterns for genes involved in the CO2 signaling pathway of the stomata. Wild-type data are presented as an average of both wild-type genotypes. Data are presented as the average of log-transformed counts-per-million +/\u2212 standard error. Green area represents a maize guard cell. The bicarbonate pool produced by CA-medicated CO2 hydration is sensed by RHC1. When bicarbonate levels are high, RHC1 interacts with and binds HT1. This prevents HT1 from inhibiting OST1 (indicated with dashed line). With HT1 sequestered to the plasma membrane, OST1 is able to activate SLAC1, which results in stomatal closure. As pictured here, RHC1 and SLAC1 are both expected to localize to the plasma membrane [28]\nIn addition to reprogramming of carbohydrate metabolism, carbon starvation is often characterized by specific changes in nitrogen metabolism. In this experiment, asparagine synthetase, aspartate aminotransferase, and glutamine synthetase were strongly upregulated under low CO2 in the mutants. Furthermore, several putative amino acid transporters were also upregulated at low CO2 (Fig.\u00a03; Additional file 6). Interestingly, orthologs of several transcription factors associated with low energy signaling in Arabidopsis, including regulation of asparagine synthetase, were also upregulated in the mutants at low CO2. This indicates a likely parallel role for these genes in maize (Fig 3; Additional file 6).\n\nFig. 3\nTop differentially expressed genes involved in synthesis of high N:C amino acids and remobilization.

Gene IDs are given in Additional file 6\nDifferentially expressed transcription factors were identified using publicly available data from GRASSIUS [26]. A total of 324 transcription factors were differentially expressed in at least one genotype/condition. At high CO2, only two transcription factors were identified as differentially expressed in ca1 mutants; these genes were likewise differentially expressed in ca1ca2 mutants. Similarly, three transcription factors were differentially expressed in ca1 mutants at the first low CO2 time point, which were all shared with ca1ca2 mutants. However, ca1ca2 mutants also differentially expressed many more transcription factors under high CO2 and the first low CO2 time point that were not shared with ca1 mutants: 33 and 115, respectively. After two days at low CO2, ca1 mutants had 111 differentially expressed transcription factors, ca1ca2 mutants had 165, and 48 of these were shared. Many transcription factor families were represented in these differentially expressed genes (Fig.\u00a04). Of the shared genes with Arabidopsis homologs of known function, several were involved in low energy signaling, regulation of asparagine synthetase, and stomatal regulation (Additional\u00a0files\u00a06 and 7).\n\nFig. 4\nTranscription factors that were differentially expressed in ca1ca2 mutants at FDR\u2009<\u20090.01, log-fold change >\u20092 or\u00a0\u2009<\u00a0-2\u2009, in at least one CO2 condition.

The species is on a decline due to depletion of forest cover, predation by natural enemies, and collection. To facilitate the conservation of the species, it is important to decide on a number of traits related to growth, immunity and reproduction addressing fitness advantage of the species.The visceral mass transcriptome of I. fruhstorferi was enabled using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencing platform. According to BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) method, the transcriptome was considered complete with 91.8% of ortholog genes present (Single: 70.7%; Duplicated: 21.1%). A total of 96.79% of the raw read sequences were processed as clean reads. TransDecoder identified 197,271 contigs that contained candidate-coding regions. Of a total of 50,230 unigenes, 34,470 (68.62% of the total unigenes) annotated to homologous proteins in the Protostome database (PANM-DB). The GO term and KEGG pathway analysis indicated genes involved in metabolism, phosphatidylinositol signalling system, aminobenzoate degradation, and T-cell receptor signalling pathway. Many genes associated with molluscan innate immunity were categorized under pathogen recognition receptor, TLR signalling pathway, MyD88 dependent pathway, endogenous ligands, immune effectors, antimicrobial peptides, apoptosis, and adaptation-related. The reproduction-associated unigenes showed homology to protein fem-1, spermatogenesis-associated protein, sperm associated antigen, and testis expressed sequences, among others. In addition, we identified key growth-related genes categorized under somatotrophic axis, muscle growth, chitinases and collagens. A total of 4822 Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) were also identified from the unigene sequences of I. fruhstorferi.This is the first available genomic information for non-model land slug, I. fruhstorferi focusing on genes related to growth, immunity, and reproduction, with additional focus on microsatellites and repeating elements. The transcriptome provides access to greater number of traits of unknown relevance in the species that could be exploited for in-depth analyses of evolutionary plasticity and making informed choices during conservation planning. This would be appropriate for understanding the dynamics of the species on a priority basis considering the ecological, health, and social benefits.Gastropod slugs are known to inhabit dynamic ecosystems with spectacular local abundances. Most of the slug species were able to expand their habitat requirements over in mountains. But, lately the distributional range of the species has spread to lowlands due to crop irrigation and watering of gardens. Incilaria fruhstorferi (NCBI txid 414,506; syn. Meghimatium fruhstorferi or Philomycus fruhstorferi Collinge, 1901) is a medium to large air-breathing slug belonging to superfamily Arionidae and family Philomycidae [1]. The members of this family including the Incilaria species show restricted distribution. I. fruhstorferi species has been recorded from Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea (Chuncheon, Busan, Deokjeokdo provinces and Jeju Island) [2].Considering the local distributions of Incilaria species and for its sustainable protection in the wild, it is imperative to implement informed conservation planning practices. This would help to understand habitat-level requirements as well as the potential of acclimatization and adaptation of the species to changing environmental conditions. In this regard, the genomic information of the species would help to screen the relevant phenotypes influencing the distributional range of the species. Currently, the only available genomic information for I. fruhstorferi in the National Canter for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) is the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and the C-type lectins viz. Incilarin A, B and C [3]. Although Incilarin could play a putative role in host defense through the recognition of molecular patterns in microbial cell surfaces, a detailed functional characterization is lacking. Further, the lack of genomic information is an impediment towards understanding the ecological adaptation strategies of Incilaria sp. in the wild with reference to growth, immunity, and reproduction. Hence, cataloguing the genomic resources would guide successful establishment of the species in the wild.The advent of effective and cost-efficient next-generation sequencing approaches have led to an increased information on non-model species at the genomic and transcriptomic levels. Conservation biologists and ecologists have found appropriate applications and an added incentive for protecting declining biodiversity in the wake of global climate change. Transcriptomics approaches have identified the regulatory genes with major impacts on development, immunity, and reproduction in many molluscan species including Aplysia californica [4], Crassostrea virginica [5], Biomphalaria glabrata [6], Radix auricularia [7], and the Manila clam, Ruditapes philippinarum [8]. Further, completed mitochondrial genomes of gastropods, bivalves, and cephalopods have been used to understand the phylogeny of the taxon [9, 10]. By and large, the transcriptome projects involving molluscs have included commercially exploited species and/or endangered species. This includes the critically endangered land snail, Satsuma myomphala [11]; Korea endangered freshwater pearl bivalve, Cristaria plicata [12], Australian mollusc, Dicathais orbita [13], Sydney rock oyster, Saccostrea glomerata [14], and the freshwater snail, Oncomelania hupensis [15], among others. The above studies identified genes with major impacts on ecologically relevant traits. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis has been useful in large-scale screening of microsatellites such as the simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In the case of molluscan species, these microsatellites would be valuable in genetic improvement of stocks through marker-assisted breeding and understanding the diversity of the species within and among populations [16, 17]. In our earlier studies, we have taken the lead in cataloguing the genomic resources for Korean endemic land snails, Aegista chejuensis and Aegista quelpartensis [18], and the threatened snail, Ellobium chinense [19] as part of prioritized conservation efforts in South Korea.In the present study, the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform was used to acquire and annotate the transcriptome of air-breathing land slug, Incilaria fruhstorferi. This is to investigate the ecological dynamics of the species through screening of growth, immunity, and reproduction related genes. We conducted a de novo assembly of the transcriptome, screened the ORF containing transcripts, and annotated the same to homologous sequences in nucleotide and protein databases including the locally curated Protostome database (PANM-DB) [20]. We screened repeats predominant in the transcriptome and identified potential SSR markers for effective use in population genetic studies. Furthermore, we investigated genes related to growth, reproduction, and immune function with special reference to the pathogen recognition receptor PGRP-SC2 and Toll-interacting protein, also known as Tollip, using phylogenetic analysis. Hence, by utilizing paired-end (PE) Illumina transcriptome sequencing, we provide the first set of genomic information in the non-model land slug I. fruhstorferi. Further, with the screening of adaptation related genes, we investigate the plasticity of the species to sustain in varied climatic zones through compatibility in terms of biological, ecological, and physiological responses. Further, we have screened candidate genes involved in Toll signalling pathway, apoptotic pathway, and inflammatory response pathways. We assume that the transcriptome resources would provide unbiased access to phenotypic screens of many traits in the species. This would promote beneficial hybridization as a means of conservation planning.Total RNA was extracted from the visceral mass tissue using the TRIzol reagent according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and treated with RNase-free DNaseI. The extracted RNA was checked for concentration, purity and integrity using NanoDrop-2000 spectrophotometer and 2100 Bioanalyzer. In this case, the concentration of RNA was 3.15\u2009ng/\u03bcl in a volume of 18\u2009\u03bcl\u2009=\u200956.7\u2009ng/\u03bcl and was considered as RNA input for library preparation and downstream processing. mRNA-seq sample preparation kit (Illumina, CA, USA) was used to construct an mRNA-seq library following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, mRNA was purified from total RNA using oligodT magnetic beads. The mRNA was broken into short fragments  of 200\u2009nt using an RNA fragmentation kit (Ambion, TX, USA). The short mRNA fragments were reverse-transcribed into first strand cDNA using random primers and reverse transcriptase and second strand cDNA with RNase H and DNA polymerase I. After purification using QIAquick PCR extraction kit, the cDNA was ligated to sequencing adapters with paired-end (PE) Adapter Oligo Mix using T4 DNA ligase. DNA fragments of the desired size (200\u2009\u00b1\u200925\u2009bp) were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencing platform to generate 125\u2009bp PE reads. All the raw data obtained from sequencing were registered with NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under SRR5936593, BioProject-PRJNA398441, and BioSample-SAMN07510659.Before the processing of clean reads for downstream assembly and annotation analysis, the raw sequencing reads were cleaned for low-quality sequences (Cutadapt 1.18 with default parameters), such as the adapter sequences and repeated reads [22]. The quality of the raw reads in fastq format was assessed using FastQC software version 0.11.5 (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk). The clean reads, thus obtained were carried forward for transcriptome de novo assembly using the Trinity short read program under the default settings of a minimum allowed length of 200\u2009bp. Under this program, the Illumina shortreads are clustered together to form the contigs (\u2018Inchworm\u2019 assembly step), contigs clustered and processed to de Bruijin graph (\u2018Chrysalis\u2019), and extraction of all probable sequences from individual components de Bruijin graphs that are parallelized (\u2018Butterfly\u2019). Redundancy from the clustered datasets was removed using cd-hit-est version 4.6.6 [23], with TransDecoder release version 2.0.3 (https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder/wiki) as a protein-prediction tool. BUSCO version 3.0.1 [24] using the metazoan_odb9 [25] was used to create a lineage dataset and assess the completeness of the transcriptome.The non-redundant unigenes were annotated to the locally curated comprehensive protein database called PANM reference database (PANM-DB) using BLASTx. The database version 2.0 release contained a total of 7,571,246 protein sequences covering the Protostomes (Arthropoda, Mollusca, and Nematoda) [26]. BLASTx searches with an E-value threshold of 1.0E-5 were also used to identify homologous sequences in the Swiss-Prot protein sequence and UniGene nucleotide sequence databases. The EuKaryotic Orthologous Groups (KOG)-DB was also scanned for understanding the categorization of unigenes to specific functional descriptors such as \u2018Cellular Processes and Signalling\u2019, \u2018Information Storage and Processing\u2019, \u2018Metabolism\u2019, and \u2018Poorly characterized\u2019 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/). The InterProScan feature of BLAST2GO professional suite (https://www.blast2go.com) was utilized to annotate the conserved domains in the unigenes. Further, the Gene Ontology (GO) annotations were retrieved with an E-value threshold of 1.0E-5  and classified into three categories at level 2 (biological process, cellular component, and molecular function). The GO functional classification of the unigenes was finally plotted using Web Gene Ontology Annotation Plot version 2.0 (WEGOv2.0) software [27]. Pathway analysis of unigene sequences were analyzed using the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database release 84.0 (http://www.genome.jp/tools/kaas/).A keyword search was employed to identify the candidate genes (involved in I. fruhstorferi immunity, reproduction, and growth) from the BLASTx annotated PANM-DB. Keywords included representative names of genes involved in different stages of molluscan immunity, cell signalling process, sex-determination, reproduction, and growth. Further, the GO terms and KEGG classification information was also utilized to identify the putative function of the gene products of the transcripts (the translated proteins). A comprehensive network of immunity-related transcripts was categorized under \u2018Pathogen Recognition Receptor\u2019\u2009, \u2018TLR Signalling Pathway (Adapter proteins, MyD88-dependent pathway)\u2019\u2009, \u2018Endogenous Ligands\u2019\u2009, \u2018Immune Effectors\u2019\u2009, \u2018Antimicrobial Peptides\u2019\u2009, \u2018Cytokines and Cytokine Receptors\u2019\u2009, and \u2018Apoptosis\u2019.For evaluating the assembly and annotation obtained for I. fruhstorferi, we performed PCR-sequencing based approach. Total RNA was extracted from I. fruhstorferi whole- body using the Trizol method. cDNA was synthesized using AccuPower RT PreMix (Bioneer, Korea) with Oligo (dT)12\u201318 primer on a MyGenie 96 thermal cycler (Bioneer, Korea). To screen the transcriptome-derived unigenes for Tollip and PGRP-SC2, we generated a database using the FASTA file derived from NCBI with the keyword \u201cgastropoda + gene name\u201d. Subsequently, we used the database for local-BLAST to find the unigene which has the target gene. The screened Tollip and PGRP-SC2 sequences were used as the subject sequence for primer designing using Primer3 ver 4.0 (http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/). The primers for PCR validation are as follows: Fwd-5\u2032-ACTTTCTGCGTGCTGGATCT-3\u2032 and Rev- 5\u2032-TTCCTACACGCACTCGACAG-3\u2032 (Tollip); Fwd-5\u2032-CCAGTATTTTTGACACCAAGTTCA-3\u2032 and Rev-5\u2032-GGCCAGGTTCTTATCTCTTGG-3\u2032 (PGRP-SC2). \u03b2-actin gene was considered as an endogenous control (Fwd-5\u2032-GTGCCAGACGCCTAACAGTA-3\u2032 and Rev-5\u2032-GATGTCACGAACAATCTCACG-3\u2032). PCR (35\u2009cycles) was conducted using PowTaq polymerase (GnC company, Daejeon, Korea) at an annealing temperature of 54\u2009\u00b0C.The I. fruhstorferi unigenes showing homology to Tollip and PGRP-SC2 sequences in PANM DB were subjected to FGENESH gene-finding software using the online Softberry suite [28]. The ORF sequences confirmed using the online tool ORFPredictor [29] were used as queries against the NCBInr database to find the homologous sequences. Once validated, the translated amino acid sequences were used as query for the predictive analysis of protein sequence and structure. The physicochemical properties of the protein sequences were analysed using DNASTAR LASERGENE ver.7.1 Protean tool (http://www.dnastar.com/). SignalP at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/ was used to examine the presence of signal peptide. Transmembrane regions were predicted using the TMHMM Server v.2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/). The domain architecture of the protein sequences were retrieved using the SMART domain analysis program at http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/. The secondary structure was predicted using PSIPRED program at http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred_new/. All the pairwise and multiple sequence alignments were performed using ClustalX2 program [30]. The alignment files (. aln extension) generated were analyzed in GeneDoc sequence visualization software for Windows [31]. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum-likelihood method with the bootstrap trials set to 1000. The phylogenetic tree was visualized using the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) ver7.0 suite at https://www.megasoftware.net/.The Perl script program MicroSAtellite (MISA) (http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/) was used to detect Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) as di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexanucleotide repeats from unigene sequences >2Kb. The homology-based repeat search program, RepeatMasker (version 4.0.6) was used to screen representative repeats such as the \u2018Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINEs)\u2019, \u2018Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs)\u2019\u2009, \u2018Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) elements\u2019, and \u2018DNA elements\u2019 https://www.girinst.org/ (http://ftp.genome.washington.edu/RM/RepeatMasker.html).BLASTx analysis was performed using 34,470 unigenes against PANM-DB to characterize the homology matrices (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Figure S1). The E-value distribution reveals that 44.59% of the sequences show homology at 1.0E-50 to 1.0E-5 (Additional file 2: Figure S1A). Majority of unigenes (37.15%) show an identity of 40\u201360%, while only 41 sequences (0.12%) show 100% identity to homologous sequences in PANM-DB (Additional file 2: Figure S1B). The highest number of unigenes (14,710 sequences; 42.67%) showed similarities in the range 60\u201380%, while only 111 sequences (0.32%) showed 100% similarity with the database sequences (Additional file 2: Figure S1C). The number of annotation hits as compared to no-hits increased in direct proportion to the length of unigenes (Additional file 2: Figure S1D). Sequences of lengths >\u20092001\u2009bp showed the highest 9867 hits. It is obvious that with longer sequences the annotation improves because they are attributed with conserved protein domains representative of protein function. Further, considering the top-hit species distribution, 44.16 and 30.58% of the unigenes matched Aplysia californica and Biomphalaria glabrata, respectively (Additional\u00a0file\u00a03: Figure S2).Among the prime endogenous ligands, all classes of HSPs have been found in the I. fruhstorferi transcriptome including the HSP70, HSP90, HSP60, small HSPs, hypoxia-inducible factors and stress-induced phosphoprotein. We also identified enzymes involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen intermediate (RNI) pathways, including the dual oxidase (DUOX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), Nitric oxide synthase (NOS), catalase (CAT), peroxiredoxin, glutathione synthetase and glutathione-s-transferase. Furthermore, classes of cathepsins and lysozyme were also noticed, that could participate in the phagocytic defense mechanisms in the pulmonate species. Enzymes that maintain balance at the level of ROS produced and removed includes the antioxidant enzymes screened from the I. fruhstorferi transcriptome such as SOD (superoxide dismutase, Cu-Zn like, Cu-like and Mn-like), CAT (catalase), and GPx-7 (glutathione peroxidase). The redox proteins screened include thioredoxin, thioredoxin-1, thioredoxin domain containing protein-3, \u2212\u20095, \u2212\u20099, \u2212\u200912, \u2212\u200915, \u2212\u200916, \u2212\u200917, peroxiredoxin-2, \u2212\u20094, \u2212\u20095, \u2212\u20096, glutaredoxin-2, and\u2009\u2212\u20093. Considering the conserved status of the antioxidant defense mechanisms in molluscs including the components identified in the present study, we confirm the existence of a potent defense system guarding against ROS and RNIs.Furthermore, 22 transcripts of cathepsins belonging to B, L, F, Z, and O forms have been screened from the I. fruhstorferi transcriptome. Incilarin A and B showing homology to animal C-type lectins were also screened in the present study. We found transcripts of caspases, Baculoviral IAP repeat containing proteins (IAPs), apoptotic inducible factors (AIF), apoptosis regulator, apoptosis inhibitor 1, Bax, and Bcl-2 from the de novo analysis of I. fruhstorferi transcriptome.Under the reproduction-related transcripts, we identified unigenes related to sperm flagellar protein, spermatogenesis-associated protein, sperm surface protein, spermidine synthase, spermine oxidase, sperm-associated antigens, testis expressed sequences, vitellogenin, and kinases in the present study (Additional\u00a0file\u00a013: Table S3). In the Incilaria transcriptome, sperm associated antigen \u2212\u20091, \u2212\u20096, \u2212\u20097, \u2212\u200916, and\u2009\u2212\u200917 were noticed. The overall scope of sex-determination and reproduction related genes from the air-breathing land slug, I. fruhstorferi provides substantive evidence for understanding the molluscan sex-development and differentiation.In the present study, transcriptome characterization identified transcripts putatively related to the somatotrophic axis and muscle growth in I. fruhstorferi. The candidate genes related to somatotrophic axis includes insulin-related peptide, epidermal growth factor receptor, mollusk derived growth factor, adenosine deaminase and other transcription factors (Additional\u00a0file\u00a014: Table S4). Further, we identified transcripts such as actin, profilin, tropomyosin related to muscle growth and other transcripts such as chitinase, collagen, apolipophorins, dermatopontins, perlucin and calcitonin related to overall growth and development. Here, we have identified transcripts putatively related to actin, actin-1, actin-2-like, actin-5C-like, and actin-related protein\u2009\u2212\u20093, \u2212\u20095, \u2212\u20096, and\u00a0\u2212\u20098. We also found profilin-like and profilin-4-like transcripts involved in the restructuring of the actin cytoskeleton. It is speculated that profilins could regulate actin cytoskeleton through the control of actin polymerization. In the present study, we have also identified some proteins of unknown function in muscle growth. Hence, further studies at the single-gene level are warranted for more information on the regulatory mechanisms underlying growth and development in molluscs. This information would certainly advance the knowledge of candidate growth biomarkers related to molluscan development.The construction of a complete mRNA-seq library was considered necessary for the characterization of regulatory transcripts in I. fruhstorferi, a pulmonate slug species with restricted distribution. The slug species has not been categorized under the protective list of faunal biodiversity. This makes the slug population more susceptible towards habitat degradation and environmental perturbations. The basic idea of this study was to explore the fitness traits regulating adaptation and survival of the species in the wild. The microsatellite markers directly found on the expressed transcripts is considered useful for population diversity assessment and marker-assisted breeding. For the processing of I. fruhstorferi transcriptome, we used the Illumina Hi-Seq 4000 platform with paired-end reads layout. Further, we considered FastQC statistics and Cutadapt data for an initial quality assessment of Illumina sequencing data as these are the preferred choices to arrive at clean datasets (with Phred quality \u2265 Q20) [12, 32, 33]. To get the non-redundant unigenes, the clean reads were assembled using the Trinity platform and clustered using the TGICL package. The unigenes were further explored for the functional annotation and microsatellite identification. The average length of unigenes obtained in this study was higher compared to the transcriptome assembly of other molluscs, including Cristaria plicata (737.1) [12], Satsuma myomphala (571.7\u2009bp) [11], Aegista chejuensis/Aegista quelpartensis (735.4/705.6) [18] and Pinctada maxima (407\u2009bp) [34].As a measure of quality, we characterized the completeness of the assembly using BUSCO assessment tool. BUSCO employs a set of genes selected from major species clade at the OrthoDB catalogue of orthologues. We were able to capture the complete expected gene content in case of Incilaria transcriptome, wherein at least 91.8% were single-copy and complete BUSCO and only 3.1% missing BUSCO. Our transcriptome assembly statistics showed a lower number of complete and duplicated BUSCOs when compared with transcriptome assembly of black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon [35]. Further, when considering the annotation of I. fruhstorferi unigenes, PANM database (Protostome database covering the protein sequences from Nematoda, Arthropoda, and Mollusca groups) was considered prominent. Most homologous sequence hits in the de novo transcriptome analysis of non-model organisms such as the pearl mollusc C. plicata [12], land snails Aegista chejuensis and Aegista quelpartensis [18], and the diving beetle Cybister chinensis [36] were observed with the homologous sequences in PANM-DB. The top-hit species distribution against the PANM-DB sequences was found biased towards completely sequenced genomes. This is the reason for over-representation of A. californica (19,945 protein-coding genes) and B. glabrata (25,539 protein-coding genes) genomic sequences. The top-hit species distribution analysis is common for the annotation of non-model species with very little or no genomic information available. Further, the lack of slug genomics data is reflected in the absence of related species sequences from the BLAST results.The functional annotation of I. fruhstorferi unigenes using the InterPro conserved domain search revealed the most conspicuous zinc finger, protein-kinase, immunoglobulin-fold, and carbohydrate-binding domains. The most classical C2H2 Znfs are known to have versatile functions, including DNA (DNA-binding domains of transcription factors), RNA, and protein contacts [37]. Our results support transcriptome studies in the land snail, Satsuma myomphala [11] and the pearl bivalve, C. plicata [12], wherein the C2H2 Znfs were found to be the most conserved domain with representations of immunoglobulin-like fold domain. Protein kinase-like domain attributes critical phosphorylation functions to the intracellular protein kinases related to signal extrapolation during key metabolic, cellular, or immune processes. Immunoglobulin-like and EGF-like fold domains commonly provide interaction surfaces to other proteins via their beta-sheets [38]. Galactose-binding domains are properties of lectins and are conspicuously found in several molluscan species including the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis [39], Eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica [40], and the Manila clam Ruditapes phillippinarum [41]. The KOG-based classification is also routinely used for functional descriptor analysis of newly sequenced genomes. [42]. The KOG database, first created in 1997, has gone through several updates, and currently has significant genome coverage. Our results support earlier reports of KOG classification analysis in molluscs such as in the Asian clam, Corbicula fluminea [43], pearl bivalve, C. plicata [12], and the land snail, S. myomphala [11]. GO annotations are based on evidences presented in the form of GO \u2018evidence codes\u2019. Generally, evidence code distribution shows the over-representation of \u2018electronic\u2019 annotations that are not genetically tested, hence may infer higher false positives. Therefore, it is to be concluded with reference to GO annotations that the interpretation of unigenes relates only to the \u2018predicted\u2019 function. The predominant evidence codes distributed for I. fruhstorferi unigenes were IEA (inferred from electronic annotation), and hence either homology-based and/or other experimental or sequence information. The GO classification represented in the present study showed similarities to the GO term annotations for Crassostrea hongkongensis [44] and C. plicata [12]. Again, KEGG is a unified database connecting genomic information to biological pathways and provides a foresight towards the putative enzymes in the genome of the species [45].Repeatmasker is used to screen DNA sequences for repeating elements or low complexity regions. These include interspersed repeats, including retroelements and DNA transposons [46]. Especially, the retroelements make up a family of transposons proposed to have important roles in adaptive processes. These elements are under sufficient selective pressure following environmental stress and could be attributed to specific adaptations across the taxa. These elements are the forerunners for genetic variation and contributors to phenotypic plasticity [47, 48]. Further, the discovery of microsatellites from transcriptomics analysis of non-model species has gained momentum in the last decade due to the direct presence of these polymorphisms in the coding sequence and its transferability function. These microsatellites would represent annotated markers within genes that could be directly related to abiotic and biotic stressors [49]. Largely, the traditional methodologies of marker mining such as the enrichment of genomic DNA libraries, followed by clone sequencing has been replaced with the more reliable, high-throughput, and cost-efficient Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) based transcriptome characterization [50, 51]. SSRs and Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers screened from transcriptomics analysis of non-model species is currently applied at the field for genetic diversity assessments and population structure dynamics having wider applicability in conservation genomics. Consistent with our results, the dinucleotide repeats were the most abundant repeats in the transcriptomics profile of other molluscan species such as the endangered land snail, S. myomphala [11], endangered Neritid mollusc, Clithon retropictus [52], and oyster, C. hongkongensis [44].At the level of molluscan transcriptome, very few reports have addressed the immune defense systems so as to make an effective adjudication of the immune surveillance mechanism against biotic and abiotic stressors. The only information on genes and pathways related to innate immune system has been reported in the endangered freshwater pearl bivalve, C. plicata [12], Mediterranean mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis [53], and gastropod, Rapana venosa [54]. With the transcriptome information of the pulmonate slug, I. fruhstorferi now available in the public domain (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX3096547[accn]), greater thrust would be laid on the functional characterization of immunity and physiology-attributed genes. As the case with molluscs, self/non-self-discrimination can be considered as the most fundamental step in invertebrate immunity. With molluscans establishing niches in diverse habitats, ecological adaptation is vital to overall sustainability of species in the wild. Pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) show great diversity in establishing one-to-one contact with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) at the extracellular, membrane, or intracellular surfaces, modulating immune signaling pathways related to the humoral defense response [55, 56]. We considered the full-length ORFs of Tollip and PGRP_SC2 obtained from Incilaria transcriptome for a detailed understanding of the putative immune signaling cascade. Tollip is an intracellular partner for TLR signaling cascade elements. In the IL-1R pathway, Tollip blocks Interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase-1(IRAK-1) phosphorylation, thus checking the IL-1 induced signaling. Further, Tollip directly interacts with TLR2 or TLR4 to negatively regulate TLR induced signaling by a similar mechanism [57]. Tollip has been cloned and characterized from Yesso scallop Patinopecten yessoensis (PyTollip), [58] grouper Epinephelus tauvina [59], crustacean Litopenaeus vannamei [60], and sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus [61]. The predicted ORF sequence of I. fruhstorferi Tollip gene (IfTollip) was smaller than PyTollip (867\u2009bp ORF encoding 288 amino acids) [58]. Among the conserved domains represented in Tollip are the C2 domain and the CUE domain. The conserved motifs of C2 domain included the basic residues at positions 87 (Arg), 132 (Arg), and 144 (His) responsible for Phosphaditylinositol-3 phosphate (PtdIns3P) and Phosphatidylinositol-1,4 diphosphate [PtdIns (4,5) P2] recognition and binding [62]. The CUE domain comprised of the conserved \u2018Met-Phe-Pro\u2019 sequence responsible for ubiquitin binding [63, 64]. This is true in most cases, however, according to a previous report, Tollip structure is more unstable in primates compared to arthropod groups suggesting selective pressure at the residue-level in higher organisms [65]. Peptidoglycan Recognition Proteins (PGRPs) bind to peptidoglycan present in the cell surface of bacteria promoting lysis and/or phagocytosis of the cell [66, 67]. PGRPs (both long and short forms) have been identified in few molluscan species such as Haliotis discus discus [68], Solen grandis [69], Argopecten irradians [70], and Chlamys farreri [71]. Six short form PGRPs with conserved amidase activity have been revealed from Crassostrea gigas genome [72]. The lack of a signal peptide in the I. fruhstorferi PGRP_SC2 (If_PGRP_SC2) was in agreement to the short PGRPs screened from the EST database of deep- sea mussel, Bathymodiolus azoricus (Ba-PGRP 2 and Ba-PGRP 4) [73]. Further, the predicted secondary structure analysis for If_PGRP_SC2 show consistency with the three-dimensional model of BaPGRP 2 [73] and Drosophila PGRP-LB residues [74].A large repertoire of PRRs including lectins, scavenger receptor (class F), Down syndrome cell-adhesion molecule (DSCAM), thioester-containing proteins (TEPs), PGRP, and fibrinogen-related proteins (FREPs) have been screened from I. fruhstorferi transcriptome. An expansion in the PRR repertoire is expected as large number of genome and transcriptome sequencing projects involving molluscan species have been completed [72]. However, the discovery of scavenger receptor family of PRRs has been limited with only reports from oyster Pinctada martensii and scallop C. farreri [75]. We have identified scavenger receptor class F member from I. fruhstorferi transcriptome. In any case, PRRs have developed an extensive network of self/non-self-discrimination in molluscs defining flexible and specific responses to microbial challenges. This provides survival advantage to the molluscs in the absence of adaptive immune mechanisms. An understanding of the TLR signaling pathway is relevant in the context of Incilaria species transcriptome as this would be a reference for molecular immunologists to excavate the adaptation mechanisms in the wild populations. We have suggested a predictive model for the TLR signaling pathway in I. fruhstorferi. The TLR signaling pathway is the most promiscuous among molluscs with genes identified and putative functions annotated in model and non-model species [76\u201378]. TLRs bind with PAMPs and elicit MyD88-dependent or independent signaling pathway. The MyD88 dependent pathway has been well known in molluscan immunity. In this case, TNF (tumor necrosis factor) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)/TRAF3 is recruited in the cytosol upon activation of the TLR-MyD88 signaling cascade. MyD88-dependent TLR pathway is involved in apoptosis and antimicrobial functions and have been identified in molluscs including C. farreri, M. galloprovincialis, and Cyclina sinensis [79, 80]. TRAF3 is proposed to mediate intranuclear signal processing through TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-mediated phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor (IRF). IRF is translocated to the nucleus where it elicits the expression of inflammatory cytokines (type I IFN). IFNs activate the Janus activated kinase \u2013signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway [81]. We have screened IRF1, STAT2, STAT4, STAT5 as putative transcription factors mediating JAK-STAT signaling and suppressor of cytokine signaling 5 (SOCS5) as negative regulator of the pathway. Further, TRAF6 mediated NF-kB signaling via transforming growth factor-beta activated kinase (TAK) and activator protein 1 (AP1) signaling has been proposed for I. fruhstorferi. A mitochondrial-like ECSIT (evolutionarily conserved signaling intermediate in Toll pathway) has also been screened that could collect signals from TRAF6 resulting in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Further, an indirect interaction may exist for ECSIT eliciting NF-kB signaling. TRAF6 mediated NF-\u03baB signaling via tumor-growth factor beta activated kinase1/2 (TAB1/TAB2) can also be postulated from the current study. Our findings are in agreement with similar studies in Zhikong scallop C. farreri [82], and S. glomerata [14]. Furthermore, contrary to genome of oyster species such as S. glomerata and C. gigas, we were unable to screen the components of mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS)-dependent RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway, indispensable for antiviral immunity in the molluscs. To sum up, besides the core elements of Toll and JAK-STAT signaling pathway, accessory components such as Tollip, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) were also identified in the present study, indicating the completeness of signaling pathways in I. fruhstorferi. Furthermore, the HSPs (preferentially HSP70 and HSP90 class) activate kinases and are regarded as negative and positive regulators of NF-kB signaling [83, 84]. In case of freshwater molluscs, Bellamya bengalensis and Lamellidans marginalis inducible NOS (iNOS) have been associated with phagocytic activity [85], while DUOX has been known to be expressed in non-phagocytic cells such as the gills in oyster, C. gigas and the scallop, M. yessoensis in response to heavy metals [86]. Earlier, we have discussed the TRAF6-ECSIT pathway for mitochondrial ROS generation through the TLR-MyD88 signaling pathway in the species. Besides roles in innate immunity ROS are also implicated in oxidative stress signaling, apoptosis, cell growth and differentiation [87]. In agreement to our results, cathepsin transcripts have also been identified from S. glomerata transcriptome [14] and hemocytes of mussel, C. plicata [88] and oyster C. virginica [89]. Cathepsin Z (CTSZ) is a lysosomal product and is implicated in immune reactions against bacteria such as Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Listeria monocytogenes, and bacterial cell surface carbohydrates such as LPS in disk abalone, Haliotis discus discus [90]. Transcripts coding for lysozyme and bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI) in I. fruhstorferi confirms the presence of bactericidal activity as an additional means of immune defense. The full-length transcript of metallothionein gene has been studied in I. fruhstorferi for understanding the phylogeny of the species under the molluscan clade [91]. Considering the apoptosis cascade and in agreement to apoptosis core components deciphered for Incilaria species, it could be speculated that AIF could drive apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner in the molluscan species [92]. Apaf-1 mediated apoptotic cascade seems absent in the molluscs and since apaf-1 has not been observed in any other mollusc, the apoptotic cascades might work independent of apaf-1. Among the extrinsic apoptosis pathway components, TNF-\u03b1 factor in association with TNF receptor-associated factor could recruit several caspases. This lay credence to the importance of apoptotic mechanisms in I. fruhstorferi health and sustainability in the wild. The cataloguing of immune-related functional transcripts from the de novo assembled transcriptome of the air-breathing pulmonate I. fruhstorferi clearly provides a defense screen that could be exploited for research on molluscan adaptation and survivability in the wild.Sex differentiation is indirectly influenced by environmental factors such as light, temperature, nutritional conditions, and reproductive physiology of the species. Moreover, over evolutionary periods, genetic effects of sex determination have accumulated. Transcriptome resources could be vital to direct the discovery of specific pathways of sex determination and successful reproduction strategies. Gonadal transcriptome analysis in molluscan species has identified candidate genes involved in sex-determination/differentiation and reproduction for commercial exploitation of molluscs on one hand [44, 93, 94] and informed conservation planning of the threatened and endangered species on the other hand [12]. This is the first exhaustive study towards identification of molecular mechanisms underpinning reproduction in the hermaphroditic slug species. An information on the regulatory genes associated with the reproductive biology of male and female sections of Incilaria species would be significant towards interpreting the population structure dynamics and conservation of germplasm. As Incilaria is a hermaphrodite, the spermatozoa and ova are produced in an ovotestis, and released through a single hermaphroditic duct. Hence, the species was not sexed for transcriptome characterization. The transcripts of sex-determining protein fem-1 (feminization-1) largely populated in the Incilaria transcriptome were also detected in C. plicata [12], Haliotis discus hannai [95], and P. margaritifera transcriptome [93]. This transcript is one of the many associated with hermaphrodite phenotypes in Caenorhabditis elegans [96]. The Sox family of transcription factors involved in the regulation of development and differentiation of germ cells have been identified in a number of invertebrates [97]. In blood clam, Tegillarca granosa, Sox homologues (Sox2, Sox8, Sox9, and Sox14) with significant difference in gene expression between males and females have been identified [94]. In the transcriptome of C. plicata, the HMG-box domain family members included Sox5, Sox6, Sox9, Sox11, Sox15, and SoxB2 [12]. Sox30, defined to be involved in the differentiation of male gametes was found to be highly expressed in the testis of the Manila clam R. philippinarum [98]. Homologs of \u03b2-catenin was screened from the I. fruhstorferi transcriptome. \u03b2-catenin activation leads to the synthesis of female sex-determining pathway. The armadillo (ARM) repeat region in molluscs is a \u03b2-catenin ortholog reported in C. hongkongensis, C. gigas, and C. farreri [44, 99, 100]. Several ARM proteins (ARM-1, \u2212\u20092, \u2212\u20093, \u2212\u20094, \u2212\u20096, \u2212\u20097, \u2212\u20098) were discovered in I. fruhstorferi transcriptome. Homologs of Wilms tumor protein 1 (WT-1) identified from the current study could essentially activate the anti-mullerian hormone receptor essential for mammalian urogenital development. Homologs of WT-1 and anti-mullerian hormone were not reported from the oyster, C. hongkongensis [44]. Although, the homologs of vertebrate DMRT (Doublesex and MAB-3 transcription factor) were identified from the C. gigas and C. plicata transcriptome [12, 44], it was not evident in the C. hongkongensis and Incilaria transcriptome. Further, our results are consistent to the screening of reproduction-associated transcripts in C. plicata [12] and the land snail, S. myomphala [11]. Spermatogenesis-associated protein 6 was found highly expressed in male tissues of the abalone H. discus hannai playing a role in flagellar mortality [95]. Most of the transcripts found are suggested to be associated with male reproductive tissues. Sperm flagellar protein 2, sperm-associated antigen 16 and 17, spermatogenesis associated protein 1 and 4, and testis-specific serine threonine protein kinase were identified from the scallop, Nodipecten subnodosus by suppressive subtractive hybridization and pyrosequencing [101].Genes related to growth and muscle development is necessary as it provides an informed decision in aquaculture breeding programs towards the selection of fitness genes for improved performance of domesticated stocks. Further with the advent of genomics technologies, gene function on expressed quantitative trait locus phenotypes has provided valuable fundamental knowledge to be applied to molecular assisted breeding programs [102]. It has also facilitated genomics approaches for improved understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in growth. Gene discovery in non-model species using the next-generation sequencing platforms has been successful in cataloguing transcripts with fundamental roles in growth and muscle development, including actin, myosin, and tropomyosin [103, 104]. Our results are consistent with the findings in the South African abalone species, Haliotis midae wherein insulin-like growth factors and insulin-like growth factor binding proteins has improved the growth pertinent to aquaculture breeding [105]. The growth factors play critical role in the development of somatotrophic axis and form the skeletal muscle in finfishes [106]. Molluscan insulin-related peptide is involved in glucose metabolism and growth as well as the regulation of germ cell proliferation and maturation [107]. The molluscan insulin-related peptide has been identified from other molluscs such as the snail, Lymnaea stagnalis [108], bivalve, Patinopecten yessoensis [109], slug, A. californica [110], and the garden slug, Deroceras reticulatum [111]. Considering the muscle growth in molluscs, actin gene is critical in contraction, cell signaling and establishment and management of cell junctions and has been isolated from A. californica [112], Haliotis species [113, 114], Chlamys farreri [115], and Rapana venosa [116].In this study, we assembled the transcriptome of land slug, I. fruhstorferi, and described candidate genes involved in immunity, sex, and growth. The assembled transcriptome was considered complete by BUSCO method. Considering that this air-breathing slug is an important node in the food web with restricted habitats, the intactness of different immune signalling modes and adaptation-related genes could provide for a compelling evidence for informed conservation planning. Furthermore, identification of microsatellites repeats/markers in the coding regions would be crucial for discovering the species in newer habitats, exploring distribution ranges and study of population diversity.Apoptosis inducing factorActivator proteinArmadillo-repeat regionATP-dependent helicaseBasic local alignment search toolBactericidal permeability-increasing proteinBenchmarking universal single-copy orthologsCatalaseCytochrome oxidase IC-type lectinsCoupling of ubiquitin conjugation to endoplasmic reticulum degradationDouble-sex and MAB-3 transcription factorDown syndrome cell-adhesion moleculeDual-oxidaseEvolutionarily conserved signalling intermediate in Toll pathwayFibrinogen-related proteinsGene ontologyGlutathione peroxidaseHeat shock proteinsInterleukin-1 associated kinaseInterferon regulatory factorsJanus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcriptionKyoto encyclopaedia of genes and genomesClusters of orthologous groupsLong interspersed nuclear elementsLong-terminal repeatsMolecular Evolutionary Genetics AnalysisMicrosatellite identification toolMyeloid differentiation factor88National Centre for Biotechnology InformationNitric oxide synthaseOpen reading framePathogen-associated molecular patternsProtostome databasePolymerase chain reactionPaired-endsPeptidoglycan recognition proteinPattern recognition proteinsReactive nucleotide intermediatesReactive oxygen speciesReverse-transcriptaseShort interspersed nuclear elementsSingle nucleotide polymorphismSuppressor of cytokine signallingSuperoxide dismutaseScavenger receptorsSequence read archiveSimple sequence repeatsTBK1/IKKi-binding domainTANK binding kinaseThioester-containing proteinsTIGR gene indices clustering toolToll-like receptorsTumor-necrosis factorTumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factorUntranslated regionsWeb gene ontology annotation plotThe datasets generated and analysed during the current study are available in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database at NCBI under the accession number SRR5936593, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRR5936593].The design, analysis, and interpretation of data in this work was supported by Soonchunhyang University Research Fund, the grant entitled \u201cGenetic Diversity Studies of Useful Wildlife Resources\u201d funded by the National Institute of Biological Resources (NIBR201703203) and the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (NRF-2017-R1D1A3B06034971).No permission was required for the collection of slugs in this study.

A total of 3 specimens ranging from 5 to 7\u2009g were collected. The air-breathing slug, I. fruhstorferi is shown in Fig.\u00a01a. After transferring the specimens to the laboratory, the visceral mass tissue (containing all the organs of the digestive and reproductive system) were dissected and immediately placed into liquid nitrogen until RNA preparation. The study follows ethical principles of use of experimental animals in biomedical research [21].\n\nFig. 1\nSize distribution of I. fruhstorferi (a) visceral mass assembled sequences. The clean reads were clustered using the Trinity de novo assembly, redundancy from the clustered sequences were removed using the TransDecoder program, defining the potential coding regions. (b) Contig length distribution, (c) Non-redundant sequences length distribution, (d) unigene length distribution\nA mRNA-Seq library was constructed after isolation of Total RNA from the visceral mass tissue of Incilaria fruhstorferi. The total number of raw reads achieved for I. fruhstorferi transcriptome was 121,442,128. The pre-processing pipeline of raw reads included the trimming of the adapter sequences from the read pairs using the Cutadapt program, filtering low-quality reads (>\u200950% of bases having Q-value \u226420), and ambiguous bases (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S1). On an average, 0.6% of reads were discarded and length of reads after trimming was 300.2\u2009bp. A total of 117,541,612 high-quality sequencing reads (16,896,672,304 bases) that constitutes 96.79% sequences (92.14% bases) were obtained from the transcriptome quality control. De novo assembly of the clean sequence reads was conducted using the Trinity assembly, generating 591,401 contigs with the largest contig size of 15,717\u2009bp. About 31.12% of the contigs were considered \u2265\u2009500\u2009bp in length, with an overall mean length of 559.3\u2009bp. Out of the total of 591,401 contig sequences, 197,271 sequences with potential ORF were screened including 107,658 sequences of lengths \u2265500\u2009bp. TGICL (TIGR gene indices clustering tool) clustering of the assembled sequences with potential open reading frames (ORF) identified 50,230 unigene sequences (67,667,335 bases), with the smallest to largest unigenes ranging from 135\u2009bp to 26,139\u2009bp. A statistical summary of Trinity assembly, TransDecoder utility, and the de novo assembled unigenes is depicted in Table\u00a01. Further, the unigenes showed a greater length distribution when compared with the contigs and the assembled sequences. Almost 32.71% of contigs were \u2264\u2009300\u2009bp and only 3.02% was above 2001\u2009bp (Fig. 1b). This is in contrast to 20.94% (\u2264\u2009300\u2009bp) and 13.5% (>\u20092000\u2009bp) in the ORF containing transcripts obtained by TransDecoder program (Fig. 1c). Almost 20.7% unigenes showed lengths of >\u20092000\u2009bp, increasing the possibility of obtaining full-length transcripts (Fig. 1d). Based on BUSCO, we assessed the \u201ccompleteness\u201d of the I. fruhstorferi transcriptome. A total of 978 number BUSCOs were searched, out of which 691 (91.8%) were complete and single-copy BUSCOs, 206 complete and duplicated BUSCOs (21.1%), 50 (5.1%) fragmented, and 31 (3.1%) missing BUSCOs.Table 1\nStatistical summary of Incilaria fruhstorferi transcriptome\nOf the 50,230 unigenes, 34,470 (68.62%) sequences showed matches to homologous sequences in PANM-DB at an E-value cut-off of 1.0E-5, followed by 16,629 (33.11%) in Swiss-Prot, and 6624 (13.19%) in NCBI\u2019s UniGene database. Annotation statistics of I. fruhstorferi unigenes against the public protein and nucleotide databases is represented in Table\u00a02. In total, 35,204 unigenes (70.09%) showed matches to homologous sequences in the databases. Out of the annotated sequences, 20,174 sequences (57.31%) showed lengths of \u2265\u20091000\u2009bp. Most of the unigenes (34,470) showed homologous matches to PANM-DB. Further, 15,760 sequences (31.38%) showed no homologous matches to the database. Possibly, most of the non-annotated sequences are shorter with lesser likelihood of conserved domains and motifs. Further, the non-annotation can be ascribed to orphaned untranslated regions (UTRs), sequences from uncharacterized genes, or sequences unique to I. fruhstorferi. The Venn diagram illustrated in Fig.\u00a02 reveals that 9457 sequences (27.44%) out of the 34,470 show specific annotation to the homologous proteins in PANM-DB. A total of 13,789 (40%) sequences, those that annotated to homologous sequences in PANM-DB also found hits in SwissProt and KOG DB, and 8195 sequences (23.77%) annotated to all the four databases. A greater number of sequence annotation hits including the unique hits were represented under PANM-DB.Table 2\nAnnotation of I. fruhstorferi unigene sequences against public protein and nucleotide databases. The unigenes are classified based on their sizes\n\n\nFig. 2\nAnnotation of I. fruhstorferi unigenes against the public protein and nucleotide databases. Venn diagram showing homologous matches of unigenes to PANM DB, UniGene, SwissProt, and KOGDB (either specific or overlapping)\nOf the 50,230 unigenes, 18,238 showed classic and conserved InterPro domains. A total of 1271 unigenes showed the predominant Zinc finger (Znf), C2H2-type domain, followed by 985 and 703 sequences showing the P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase and Zinc finger RING/FYVE/PHD-type domains, respectively (Table\u00a03). Other protein domains predominantly noticed in I. fruhstorferi unigene sequences include Protein kinase-like, Immunoglobulin-like fold, EGF-like, Galactose-binding, and Leucine-rich repeats. Further, to explore the functional direction of I. fruhstorferi unigenes, we annotated the sequences against the KOG, GO, and KEGG databases. A total of 22,984 sequences were annotated in the KOG database, out of which 69.55% of sequences had lengths of \u2265\u20091000\u2009bp. Further, the sequences were classified under 25 KOG functional categories (Fig.\u00a03). In the present annotation, 20.38% of unigenes were classified under R term (General function prediction only), followed by 10.26 and 7.51% under T (Signal transduction mechanisms) and S (function unknown) terms, respectively. A high proportion (20.01%) of sequences also classified to the \u2018multi\u2019 category (sequences belonging to more than one functional term). The least populated KOG terms included H (co-enzyme transport and metabolism), Y (nuclear structure), and N (cell motility) with 141, 137, and 39 unigene sequences, respectively.Table 3\nList of top-20 protein domains found in I. fruhstorferi unigene sequences\n\n\nFig. 3\nKOG functional classification of I. fruhstorferi unigenes. Of the 50,230 non-redundant unigene sequences, 22,984 classified under 25 functional KOG categories excluding the multifunctional category. Predominantly, the unigenes classified under R- General function and Multi category\nFor high-quality functional analysis of genomic datasets, we used the bioinformatics platform Blast2GO v5.1 (https://www.blast2go.com/). GO-based annotation and KEGG pathway maps for the I. fruhstorferi genomic datasets were elucidated using the Blast2GO software platform. A total of 15,660 unigenes were annotated to GO functional categories such as \u2018Molecular function\u2019\u2009, \u2018Biological process\u2019, and \u2018Cellular component\u2019 (Additional\u00a0file\u00a04: Figure S3). The maximum 32.63% of the sequences were classified under \u2018Molecular function\u2019 category followed by only 4.27 and 3.21% sequences classified under \u2018Biological process\u2019 and \u2018Cellular component\u2019 category, respectively. Further, 26.79% of sequences were classified to both \u2018Biological Process\u2019 and \u2018Molecular function\u2019 categories. A total of 2790 sequences (17.82%) were classified under all the three GO functional categories (Additional file 4: Figure S3A). Only 38.55% of sequences annotated against GO database were categorized under a single GO term (Additional file 4: Figure S3B). Rest of the sequences participated under more than one GO term. The GO terms (at level 2) for each of the three categories are shown in Fig.\u00a04. Within the \u2018Molecular function\u2019 category, the unigenes predominantly were predicted under binding (GO: 0005488), followed by catalytic activity (GO: 0003824) and transporter activity (GO: 0005215) (Fig. 4A). In the \u2018Cellular component\u2019 category, the top-represented GO terms included membrane (GO: 0016020), cell (GO: 0005623), and cell part (GO: 0044464) (Fig. 4B). Under \u2018Metabolic process\u2019 category, the most prominent GO terms included cellular process (GO: 0009987), metabolic process (GO: 0008152), and single-organism process (GO: 0044699) (Fig. 4C). We further annotated the assembled genomic sequences of I. fruhstorferi to associated biological pathways using the KEGG database. Only 81 sequences of enzymes were classified under \u2018Environmental Information Processing\u2019\u2009, \u2018Metabolism\u2019, and \u2018Organismal Systems\u2019 categories. These sequences are related to the 46 putative enzymes in the pathway (Table\u00a04).\n\nFig. 4\nGO classification of I. fruhstorferi unigenes at level 2. The unigene sequences classified under different functional categories under the GO term notation of (a) Molecular Function, (b) Cellular Component, and (c) Biological Process\nTable 4\nKEGG Pathway distribution\nRepeating elements promiscuous in the unigene sequences of I. fruhstorferi were analyzed using the Repeatmasker program (Homo sapiens as the species parameter) under the RepBase database (http://www.girinst.org). As suggested in Table\u00a05, the prominent repeating elements found were the LINEs, DNA repeating elements such as hAT-Charlie and TcMar-Tigger, Simple repeats, and Low complexity regions. Under the SINEs, ALU (7 elements) and MIR repeat (4 elements) occupied lengths of 1593 and 253\u2009bp, respectively. LINE repeats such as LINE1, LINE2, and L3/CR1 repeats were found occupying lengths of 11,676\u2009bp, 822\u2009bp, and 1196\u2009bp, respectively. Among the retrotransposons, lesser number of LTR elements were found as compared to the non-LTR LINE elements. In the present study, the 50,230 assembled unigene sequences were screened for SSR markers using MISA (MicroSAtellite identification tool) (Table\u00a06). A total of 4822 SSRs were identified in 3888 unigene sequences with 700 sequences containing more than 1 SSR. These SSRs were then classified on the basis of number of repeats to di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexanucleotide repeats. Mononucleotide repeats were not considered for analysis due to the possibility of homopolymer formation during Illumina sequencing. A maximum of dinucleotide repeats were noticed followed by trinucleotides and tetranucleotide repeats. Dinucleotide repeats existed in maximum six iterations, trinucleotides in maximum five iterations, tetra- and pentanucleotide repeats in maximum of four iterations. Further, in an attempt to classify the SSR repeat types, it was found that the dinucleotide repeat AT/AT (1107 SSR) and AC/GT (814 SSR) were the most predominant. Among the trinucleotide repeats, ATC/ATG and AAG/CTT with 698 and 446 SSRs were the dominant. AACC/GGTT and AGAT/ATCT repeats with 158 and 136 SSRs were the dominant tetranucleotide repeats. A summary of SSR repeat types is shown in Fig.\u00a05.Table 5\nRepeatMasker based analysis of repeating elements in the Incilaria fruhstorferi unigenes\n\namost repeats fragmented by insertions or deletions have been counted as one element\nRepBase Update 20,160,829; RM database version 20,160,829\nTable 6\nScreening of Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) from unigene sequences of Incilaria fruhstorferi\n\n\nFig. 5\nDistribution of Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) types found in the unigenes of I. fruhstorferi. The most predominant repeat types included the dinucleotides AT/AT and AC/GT\nA keyword search composed of a series of representative innate immunity and oxidative stress genes was used to screen candidate unigenes putatively responsible for I. fruhstorferi immune defense. The GO term and KEGG classification also provided sufficient information regarding the representative genes classified under \u201cimmune system\u201d. An exhaustive summary of the candidate genes under immune defense categories such as \u2018pathogen recognition receptor (PRR)\u2019\u2009, \u2018TLR signalling pathway\u2019, \u2018adaptor proteins\u2019\u2009, \u2018MyD88-dependent pathway\u2019\u2009, \u2018endogenous ligands\u2019\u2009, \u2018immune effectors\u2019\u2009, \u2018antimicrobial peptides\u2019\u2009, \u2018cytokines and cytokine receptors\u2019\u2009, \u2018apoptosis-related factors\u2019\u2009, and \u2018others\u2019 are summarized (Additional\u00a0file\u00a05: Table S2). Overall, we were able to retrieve the extensive repertoire of genes that could be relevant to understand the molluscan innate immune signalling process and the specific host defense system against pathogens. Furthermore, genes involved in the unique features of the slug\u2019s physiology have been summarized in Table\u00a07. We would like to emphasize that the screening of heat shock protein and the aquaporin family genes from I. fruhstorferi transcriptome can be scaled-up for functional genomics approaches to understand the physiological rules of adaptation in the species.Table 7\nGenes of interest related to Adaptation/Physiology in the land slug, Incilaria fruhstorferi\nFrom the transcriptome survey of I. fruhstorferi, we have screened unigenes homologous to PRRs such as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectins (CTLs), other lectin classes (I-type lectin, Malectin, Collectin, Selectin, Galectin), fibrinogen-related proteins (FRPs), and scavenger receptors (SRs), among others. Further, we have targeted the Tollip (IfTollip) and the Peptidoglycan Recognition Protein-SC2 (IfPGRP_SC2) for an elaborate in silico analysis covering the conserved domain architecture and phylogenetic position among orthologs. Further, to prove the accuracy of transcriptome results (validation of gene assembly and annotation), a PCR-sequencing based approach targeting IfTollip and IfPGRP-SC2 were successfully used. The sequences of PCR products thus obtained were aligned with the screened unigenes representing the target genes, revealing 100% identity (Additional\u00a0file\u00a06: Figure S4). This study did not include the functional characterization of IfTollip and IfPGRP_SC2 due to the difficulties in maintaining the experimental model and limited sample availability. We predicted the full-length ORF and the translated amino acid sequence of I. fruhstorferi Tollip (IfTollip) using bioinformatics analysis (Additional\u00a0file\u00a07: Figure S5). The IfTollip ORF composed of 840\u2009bp encoding a polypeptide of 279 amino acids. The predicted molecular weight of IfTollip is 31.38\u2009kDa, with an isoelectric point (pI) of 6.21. Multiple sequence alignment of Tollips from representative invertebrate and vertebrate species followed by SMART domain analysis revealed three conserved domains including Tom-1 binding domain (TBD), conserved core domain 2 (C2), and coupling of ubiquitin to endoplasmic reticulum degradation (CUE) domain (Additional\u00a0file\u00a08: Figure S6). Secondary structure prediction of IfTollip showed two and three \u03b1-helices at the N-terminal and the C-terminal (CUE domain), respectively (Additional\u00a0file\u00a09: Figure S7). The C2 domain was conspicuously represented by \u03b2-sheets and connecting loops. Furthermore, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using full-length amino acid sequences of Tollip from other species (Fig.\u00a06). IfTollip was grouped closer to Tollips from molluscs showing most close association with B. glabrata and A. californica. This suggests that the evolutionary position of Tollip is conserved across phylum.\n\nFig. 6\nPhylogenetic relationships inferred for IfTollip using the maximum-likelihood method of MEGA7 program.

If_PGRP_SC2 showed a predicted molecular mass of 19\u2009kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point of 6.75. In silico analysis of the protein sequence revealed the characteristic overlapping of the PGRP and N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase domains (amidase_2 domain). Further, If_PGRP_SC2 lacked a signal peptide sequence. Multiple sequence comparisons (Additional\u00a0file\u00a011: Figure S9) revealed the conserved amidase activity motifs (Zn2+\u2009\u2212\u2009binding sites at His-40, Tyr-75, His-149, and Cys-155), and the disulphide bridges. Our results reveal that \u2018If_PGRP_SC2\u2019 like other insect PGRPs are cross-linked with a single disulphide bond. Further, the residues utilized for DAP-type PGN binding (Gly-60, Trp-61, and Arg-80) are found to be conserved. If_PGRP_SC2 protein shows three \u03b1-helices and five \u03b2-strands based on predictive secondary structure analysis (Additional\u00a0file\u00a012: Figure S10). According to the phylogenetic analysis If_PGRP_SC-2 was closely clustered with Physella acuta PGRP and B. glabrata PGRP-SC with a strong bootstrap support (Fig.\u00a07). Further, we have deciphered the TLR signalling cascade hypothesized for I. fruhstorferi in Fig.\u00a08 (detailed in the discussion section).\n\nFig. 7\nPhylogenetic analysis of If_PGRP_SC-2.

(DOCX 22 kb)", "s12864-019-5527-2": "Coral reefs can experience salinity fluctuations due to rainfall and runoff; these events can have major impacts on the corals and lead to bleaching and mortality. On the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), low salinity events, which occur during summer seasons and can involve salinity dropping ~\u200910 PSU correlate with declines in coral cover, and these events are predicted to increase in frequency and severity under future climate change scenarios. In other marine invertebrates, exposure to low salinity causes increased expression of genes involved in proteolysis, responses to oxidative stress, and membrane transport, but the effects that changes in salinity have on corals have so far received only limited attention. To better understand the coral response to hypo-osmotic stress, here we investigated the transcriptomic response of the coral Acropora millepora in both adult and juvenile life stages to acute (1\u2009h) and more prolonged (24\u2009h) exposure to low salinity.Differential gene expression analysis revealed the involvement of both common and specific response mechanisms in Acropora. The general response to environmental stressors included up-regulation of genes involved in the mitigation of macromolecular and oxidative damage, while up-regulation of genes involved in amino acid metabolism and transport represent specific responses to salinity stress.This study is the first comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of the coral response to low salinity stress and provides important insights into the likely consequences of heavy rainfall and runoff events on coral reefs.Coral reefs are amongst the most diverse and complex of ecosystems and, as well as their biological significance, are of enormous social and economic importance [1]. However, they are experiencing long-term decline on a global scale due to overfishing, pollution, and climate change [2, 3]. Climate change is likely to be an increasingly significant cause of coral loss through thermal stress and ocean acidification [4, 5], but also via increases in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones, which can expose coral reefs to more extreme and sudden salinity variations [6\u20138]. These conditions affect the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), where rain associated with tropical cyclones can lower the salinity of surface waters significantly (up to 10 PSU) [9], with these hypo-saline conditions sometimes prevailing for weeks [10]. Although the impacts of heavy rainfall can be correlated with coral decline on the GBR [11], the physiological effects of hypo-saline stress have not been thoroughly investigated. A few studies have described loss of Symbiodiniaceae and coral mortality following hypo-saline stress events [12\u201314], but no data are available on the molecular response of corals during these events.Like many other marine invertebrates, corals are considered to be osmoconformers \u2013their internal environment is near isotonic with the external environment \u2013 and can only tolerate a relatively narrow range of salinity (i.e. they are stenohaline). Our current understanding of osmoregulation processes in corals is largely derived from other marine invertebrates such as sea anemones and bivalves; in these organisms, small organic molecules and inorganic ions are used to prevent osmotic lysis [15, 16]. These molecules, known as osmolytes, include free amino acids (FAAs), FAA derivates (taurine, glycine betaine), floridoside and other compounds such as dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) [17, 18]. In many cases, organisms use a variety of osmolytes and related species may use quite different mechanisms. For example, the sea anemone Metridium senile, and marine sponges Halichondria okadai and H. japonica exhibit a general decrease of their FAA content during hypo-osmotic stress, whereas FAA content appears to increase in the coral Acropora aspera under these conditions [16, 19, 20]. Several other environmental stressors, such as temperature and elevated CO2, cause changes in the expression of specific molecular chaperones in corals [21, 22] and these are likely to be components of a general stress response system.While the literature on the molecular responses of corals to hypo-osmotic stress is very limited, comprehensive datasets are available for some other marine invertebrates [21, 22]. In mussels, for example, responses to hypo-osmotic stress include increases in levels of oxidative stress proteins and proteolysis, as well as changes in expression of membrane transporter proteins, although closely related species have been shown to respond differently [23]. In the present study, the transcriptomic response of the common reef-building coral Acropora millepora to hypo-saline conditions was investigated. Through the availability of a whole genome assembly and a comprehensive set of protein predictions for this organism, it is now possible to compare the response of this coral to those of other marine invertebrates, to tease apart specific and general responses to different environmental stressors [21, 24, 25]. Here we exposed adult colonies of Acropora millepora, as well as aposymbiotic juveniles (devoid of any photosynthetic symbionts), to hypo-saline conditions mimicking those experienced in extreme weather events (25 PSU for the adults and 28 PSU for the juveniles). Although changes in the microbiome have previously been reported [26], this is the first study to comprehensively describe the molecular response of a coral to hypo-saline stress, and identifies both specific and general components of the response of A. millepora to environmental stressors.The work described here was carried out under GBRMPA permit G09/30327.1. Eight Acropora millepora colonies were collected from Orpheus Island, Queensland, Australia (18\u00b039\u203252. 43\u2033S, 146\u00b029\u203242.38\u2033E) in June 2013 and transferred to the Australian Institute of Marine Science\u2019s National Sea Simulator (SeaSim) facility where the colonies were acclimated for 14\u2009days in outdoor aquaria at ~\u200927\u2009\u00b0C. Each colony was fragmented into 25 nubbins (~\u20096\u2009cm) that were then randomly distributed across nine 50\u2009L tanks. The tanks were linked to a computer-controlled flow-through system supplying 0.4\u2009\u03bcm filtered seawater (FSW) maintained at 25.7\u2009\u00b0C (\u00b10.6\u2009\u00b0C) and an ambient salinity of 35 PSU. UV-filtered lights were mounted above each tank and nubbins were exposed to an intensity of 250 \u03bcE over a 12:12\u2009h light/dark cycle (type of lights: 400\u2009W metal halide lamps, BLV). The nubbins were acclimated in this system for a further 19\u2009days to allow recovery. At the beginning of the experiment, corals were transferred to two tanks (one per treatment), the flow was stopped to ensure no water exchange and tanks were oxygenated via a pump (Tunze 6015). The nubbins were subsequently exposed to one of two salinity regimes for the duration of the experiment (24\u2009h): ambient/control salinity of 35 PSU (n\u2009=\u200945), or low salinity of 25 PSU (n\u2009=\u200940). Some nubbins were used as test samples before the start of the experiment and to test the effects of treatments not included in this study, hence the larger number of nubbins at the beginning of the experiment. The 25 PSU FSW was prepared by diluting 700\u2009ml of 35 PSU FSW with 300\u2009ml reverse-osmosis water. The temperature during the treatment period was maintained at 25.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7\u2009\u00b0C. Salinity was monitored using a water quality meter (TPS 90FL, ThermoFisher). Coral nubbins (n\u2009=\u20091 per colony, for both control and treatment) were sampled at two time points for RNA analysis, at 1 and 24\u2009h post the salinity change (samples were taken at 12:00 and 1:00\u2009pm respectively). A total of 18 nubbins for RNA analysis (n\u2009=\u20095 per time point for each condition, but n\u2009=\u20093 in the case of the 24\u2009h treatment) were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u2212\u200980\u2009\u00b0C.For the experiment on coral juveniles, six Acropora millepora colonies were collected from Trunk Reef, GBR, Australia (18\u00b022\u203215.10\u2033S/ 146\u00b048\u203227.82\u2033E) and transferred to the National Sea Simulator (SeaSim) facility prior to the predicted spawning event in November 2013. Colonies were individually placed in 70\u2009L tanks with 0.2\u2009\u03bcm of filtered seawater (FSW). After spawning, gametes were collected and mixed to allow fertilization to occur. Fertilized embryos were transferred to larval rearing tanks and raised as described in Tebben et al. [27] and Raina et al. [28]. At 13\u2009days post-fertilization, larvae were collected using a 1\u2009mm mesh net, washed three times in 0.2\u2009\u03bcm FSW and then settled in (sterile) 6-well plates (8 plates per species, 40 larvae per well; each well filled with 4\u2009ml of ambient salinity (35 PSU) 0.2-\u03bcm FSW) using a cue (5\u2009\u03bcL) derived from crustose coralline algae (CCA; see Siboni [29]). Throughout the incubation phase, the plates were maintained in the dark at 26.3\u2009\u00b0C (\u00b1 0.01) and the FSW was changed every second day. Four days post-settlement (T0), plates were separated into two groups: 16 plates were maintained at 35 PSU (control salinity) while the seawater in the remaining 16 plates was exchanged for 28 PSU (salinity stress treatment). The salinity stress applied in the case of the juveniles (28 PSU) was slightly less challenging than that used for the adults (25 PSU) based on the high mortality rate observed at 25 PSU during a pilot study. Samples were collected for RNA after 24\u2009h (T24), and 48\u2009h (T48) at 2:00\u2009pm each day (n\u2009=\u200923 samples; n\u2009=\u20096 wells per treatment per time point, but n\u2009=\u20095 in the case of the 48\u2009h control).Total RNA was extracted from 18 adult nubbins of five genotypes of 25 and 35 PSU treatments (n\u2009=\u20095 for each condition per time point, but n\u2009=\u20093 for 24\u2009h treatment) following the same methods described in Aguilar et al. [30]. Coral juveniles were sampled by removing the water and adding 1.5\u2009mL of RNAlater (Ambion, cat# AM7021) simultaneously to each well (n\u2009=\u200940 juveniles) and scraping the content with a sterile 200\u2009\u03bcL plastic tip to transfer the contents into a 2\u2009mL tube and stored at \u2212\u200920\u2009\u00b0C. Twenty four samples (n\u2009=\u20096 wells per treatment per time point) from the content of each well were used to extract total RNA using the RNAaqueous-Micro total RNA isolation kit (AM1931, AMBION). The quality and quantity of RNA preparations were determined using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer) with samples prepared following the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit instructions (cat # 5067\u20131511).RNAseq libraries (18 for the adults and 23 for the juveniles) were constructed using the NEB Next Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, E7420S) following the manufacturers recommended protocol, and 100\u2009bp paired-end sequence data obtained using a HiSeq 2000 at the Biomolecular Resource Facility (Australian National University). After trimming (70\u201380% of reads retained), reads were mapped onto the Acropora millepora genome (Ying et al., in prep) using TopHat2 [31] and counts data generated using htseq-count [32] for subsequent analysis. The mapping efficiency varied significantly, in general being much higher for larvae (>\u200980%) than for adults (45\u201360%) due to the presence of Symbiodiniaceae in the latter. Approximately 70% of mapped reads were counted as genes. Genes IDs in this paper refer to the A. millepora protein predictions (e.g. 1.2.1.m1) that have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under the reference number GSE96916.The read count matrix was analysed in R (R Core Team 2014) using the package arrayQualityMetrics [33] to check for outliers, and was transformed (variance stabilizing transformation (VST)) to be visualized using a principal component analysis (PCA). Although potential effects of pseudoreplication caused by using only one tank per condition could not be tested, note that this has also frequently also been the case in similar published gene expression studies [34, 35]. The DESeq2 package [36] was used to test for differential gene expression due to the effects of salinity, while controlling for the effect of the genotype in the case of the adult dataset (design\u2009=\u2009~ genotype + treatment). For the juvenile dataset, as each sample was a mixture of genotypes, genotype effects could not be considered (design\u2009=\u2009~ treatment). Default functions for estimating size factors, dispersion and negative binomial Wald Test were used in DESeq2. Log2 fold changes (log2FC) in gene expression levels were obtained in DESeq2 by comparing control (35 PSU) vs. salinity treatment of four different comparisons: (i) control vs. treatment at 1\u2009h in the adults, (ii) control vs. treatment at 24\u2009h in the adults, (iii) control vs. treatment at 24\u2009h in the juveniles and, (iv) control vs. treatment at 48\u2009h in the juveniles. False discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p values were controlled at 5% for each gene according to the methods of Benjamini and Hochberg [37].Statistically over-represented gene ontology (GO) categories were determined in BiNGO [38] in Cytoscape 3.1.1 [39] using the hypergeometric test and a FDR significance level of <\u20090.01 on the set of genes that were differentially up- or down-regulated in each dataset. These GO categories were used to search specific pathways in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) by downloading pathway sequences (using Homo sapiens and Nematostella vectensis as references for the pathways: protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, nve0414, hsa04141; proteasome, nve03050, hsa03050; peroxisome, nve04146, hsa04146; lysosome, nve04142, hsa04142; glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, nve00260, hsa00260; glutathione metabolism, nve00480, hsa00480; alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, nve00250, hsa00250; ABC transporters, nve02010, hsa02010) and blasting these sequences against the A. millepora protein predictions. All results are based on similarity of the A. millepora protein predictions to a reference annotated protein (evalue cut-off\u2009=\u20091e\u2212\u20094).Eighty-four GO terms were over-represented in the adults after 1\u2009h of salinity stress, while this number decreased to 13 GO terms after 24\u2009h (Additional file 4: Table S2). For the juveniles, 48 GO terms were over-represented after 24\u2009h of salinity stress and this number decreased to 33 GO terms after 48\u2009h. At both time points the GO term with the highest FDR was the \u2018small molecular metabolic process\u2019 (FDR 1.17E-12 and 5.24E-07 after 24 and 48\u2009h). GO analysis revealed several categories that were down-regulated after 1\u2009h but up-regulated after 24\u2009h in the adults: (i) protein homeostasis, including: endoplasmic reticulum (ER), ER lumen, proteasome complex, cell catabolism and oxidoreductase activity; and (ii) amino acid and nitrogen metabolism. Based on these results, we used the sequences from specific KEGG pathways to find homologues in the coral transcriptome and understand the responses of these genes to hypo-saline stress.Increased expression of components of the unfolded protein response (UPR) system was recorded after 1 and 24\u2009h of hypo-saline stress (Fig. 2; Additional file 4: Table S3). The UPR system relies on three major transmembrane proteins involved in sensing stress that were differentially regulated during this experiment. Coral genes homologous to the serine/threonine-protein kinase/endoribonuclease IRE1 (IRE1), and its interacting pro-apoptotic effector BAX, were up-regulated after 1\u2009h (0.30 log2FC, FDR 2.59E-02 and 0.41 log2FC, FDR 2.78E-02 respectively; Fig. 2; Additional file 4: Table S3). In addition, genes homologous to the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase (PERK), and the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) were up-regulated after 24\u2009h of stress (0.60 log2FC, FDR 6.25E-03 and 0.42 log2FC, FDR 1.89E -02 respectively; Fig. 2; Additional file 4: Table S3).Osmotic stress involves changes in the cellular concentrations of many inorganic and organic molecules, and this was corroborated by altered expression of many genes associated with transport of ions or organic molecules, including several solute carrier (SLC) families, ATPases, voltage-gated K+ channels, and voltage-dependant Ca2+ channels (VDCC). After 1\u2009h of salinity stress, three of the nine Na+/(Ca2+\u2009\u2212\u2009K+) exchangers (SLC24) identified were up-regulated, while four Na+ and Cl\u2212 dependent transporters (SLC6) were down-regulated (Additional file 4: Table S6). After 24\u2009h, eight SLC6 genes and three SLC24 genes were down-regulated. In the case of ATPases, five genes were down-regulated after 1\u2009h, whereas five were up-regulated after 24\u2009h of stress. Amongst the ATPases, the relative expression of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA; an ER-associated Ca2+ influx channel) changed from \u2212\u20091.40 log2FC at 1\u2009h to 1.63 log2FC after 24\u2009h (FDR 1.15E-09 and 3.59E-05 respectively). Conversely, expression of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), which are Ca2+ efflux channel components, was down-regulated after 24\u2009h (FDR \u2212\u20091.35 log2FC; 4.05E-03; Fig. 2; Additional file 4: Table S3). In addition, three voltage-dependant Ca2+ channels were not differentially expressed after 1\u2009h, but down-regulated after 24\u2009h.GO analysis revealed an over-representation of terms associated with amino acid metabolism, with a strong response of genes implicated in glycine betaine catabolism following osmotic stress in the adults (Fig. 3; Additional file 4: Table S5). The first step in glycine betaine catabolism involves betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT), which transfers a methyl group from glycine betaine to homocysteine to produce dimethylglycine (DMG) and methionine. In the work described here, two betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT) homologues were up-regulated (by 2.5 and 5.43 log2FC; FDR 6.39E-70 and 2.38E-69) after 24\u2009h of stress. The DMG produced by the BHMT reaction can be converted to glycine by two enzymes (DMGDH and SARDH, Fig. 3), homologues of both of which were up-regulated after 1 and 24\u2009h of hypo-saline stress.Hypo-saline stress also caused changes in the expression of genes involved in ammonia assimilation. The coral NADH-dependant glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH1), which catalyses the release of ammonia from glutamate, was up-regulated after 1 and 24\u2009h of stress (log2FC of 0.47 and 2.54 respectively; FDR 1.21E-02 and 4.28E-55). Conversely, genes involved in ammonia assimilation - the NADPH-dependant GDH (GDH2), glutamine synthase (GS), and glutamate synthase (GOGAT) - were down-regulated (Fig. 3; Additional file 4: Table S5). Genes involved in the L-arginine degradation pathway were also up-regulated in hypo osmotic stress, expression of both ornithine transaminase (OAT), and pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (ALDH4A1) increasing (by 0.52 and 1.51 log2FC respectively; FDR 2.16E-05 and 1.10E-11) after 24\u2009h (Fig. 3; Additional file 4: Table S5).The responses of adult and juvenile corals were similar after 24\u2009h of stress for a substantial number of DEGs (1191) (Additional file 3: Figure S3). For example, genes encoding proteasome subunits, components of the UPR system, and glycine betaine catabolism were up-regulated in both juveniles and adults after 24\u2009h (see above). Conversely, three important ER luminal chaperones (BiP, GRP94 and NEF) showed opposite expression trends in the two life stages, being up-regulated in adults but down-regulated in juveniles (Additional file 4: Table S3). Of the four treatments studied, the prolonged (48\u2009h) exposure of juveniles resulted in the lowest number (1485, FDR\u2009<\u20090.05) of differentially expressed genes in response to hypo-saline conditions. After 48\u2009h, expression levels of many genes that were differentially expressed after 24\u2009h in juveniles had returned to control levels, suggesting that a degree of acclimation may have occurred. For example, only two ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) subunits were differentially expressed at 48\u2009h, whereas ten were so at 24\u2009h (Additional file 4: Table S3). A similar decrease was observed in the case of E2 ubiquitin-conjugation enzymes - from 13 to three up-regulated members after 24 and 48\u2009h respectively (Additional file 4: Table S3).Gene expression data revealed a strong response of the coral A. millepora to hypo-saline stress, with clear differences between acute salinity shock (1\u2009h) and more prolonged (24\u2009h) exposure in adult corals. Here we describe a group of genes that are part of a general response to stress in corals, and a second group that are known to respond to osmotic stress in other organisms but were not previously described in corals. The first group includes genes involved in antioxidant production, and in protein homeostasis (comprising molecular chaperones, components of the ER associated protein degradation (ERAD) and unfolded protein response (UPR) systems). The second group comprises genes involved in osmoregulation, including molecular transporters and amino acid metabolism, particularly glycine betaine. Together, variations in the expression of these two groups of genes provide insights into the molecular basis of hypo-osmotic stress in corals and the changes involved in adjusting to this stress over time.Of the HSPs associated with ER processes, the luminal chaperone GRP94 (Fig. 2, Additional file 4: Table S3, 1.2.15211.m1) is of particular interest. As in other systems, this calcium-binding protein blocks apoptosis, and plays a key role in facilitating recovery from ER stress [48]. GRP94 expression was elevated after 24\u2009h of salinity stress, and also responded to acute CO2 [24] and thermal stress in corals [43]. The mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) orthologue also responded to hypo-saline stress [49] (Table 1). In the present study, the ER-lumenal HSP70 BiP, which is involved in protein folding and is a component of the ERAD system [50] was up-regulated under hypo-saline conditions, and is also induced by challenge with bacteria [51] or lipopolysaccharide (LPS [52];). However, BiP was not differentially expressed under high CO2 stress [24], suggesting that it has a broad, but not universal, role in coral stress responses (Table 1).Down-regulation of ERAD system components was observed after the acute salinity treatment (1\u2009h); however unfolded protein response (UPR) system components were up-regulated after both 1 and 24\u2009h, suggesting that misfolded proteins accumulated as early as 1\u2009h after the onset of osmotic stress. The activation of the UPR system can have two opposite outcomes: it can promote survival and resistance to ER stress and/or it can activate a cell death response [53]. For example, in mammals the endoribonuclease inositol-requiring enzyme\u20131 (IRE1) signalling protein can interact with the pro-apoptotic protein BAX, or it can activate c-JUN to promote cell survival [53]. Like its mammalian orthologue, coral BAX promotes cell death [54], but up-regulation of BAX under hypo-osmotic stress was small compared to that of the pro-survival protein, c-JUN, suggesting that the latter outcome might predominate during hypo-saline stress. Previous studies by Maor-Landaw et al. [55] in Stylophora pistillata found that PERK increased during temperature stress, and expression of c-JUN and MAPK7 homologues increased under hypo-saline stress in mussel [21]. There is also evidence of a general increase of UPR associated genes in an expression module of the coral Acropora hyacinthus under high heat stress [56]. However, the present study is the first to document differential expression of the three main transmembrane proteins that regulate the UPR (BAX, IRE1, and PERK), and components of the corresponding downstream signalling pathways (Fig. 2; Additional file 4: Table S3).As adjustments to hypo-saline conditions require cell volume regulation, transport of ions through membranes plays an important role in adjusting this osmotic potential, and is mediated by H+ translocating ATPases, Ca2+-ATPases, secondary active transporters, and channels [57]. While ion transport proteins have been extensively characterized in higher animals, fungi and plants [58, 59], little is known about these genes families in cnidarians (but see [60, 61]). When the results of the present study were compared with those derived from mussels under hypo-saline stress, the expression of several specific transporters (MCT, Nacra5, and ATP1A1) showed similar trends, whereas an opposite response was observed for others (SLC6A5, SLC17A5, and KCNA, Table\u00a01). However, some of these apparent differences may be a consequence of the difficulty in identifying true orthologues across the deep evolutionary divide between molluscs and cnidarians (Table 1 and Additional file 4: Table S7). In general, and as mentioned by Lockwood and Somero [21], the responses of these transporters reflect two opposite adaptive mechanisms to stress: (i) moving ions across the membrane to stop cell swelling, and (ii) arresting the transport activities when solute concentrations inside the cell exceed requirements [62, 63]. Some of the results presented here might reflect these opposing activities, but also highlight the complexity of the gene families involved.Marine invertebrates adjust their osmotic concentration not only by inorganic ion fluxes, but also via organic osmolytes such as taurine or betaines. Glycine betaine is thought to be an important osmolyte in corals, constituting >\u200990% of the organic solutes measured in Fungia, Pocillopora, Montipora and Tubastrea [18, 64]. Increased transcription of genes involved in glycine betaine catabolism was observed in the present study, implying that degradation of this compound occurred during hypo-osmotic stress (Fig. 3, Additional file 4: Table S5). Previous experiments on the effects of hypo-saline stress in the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas also found an increase in transcription of betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT), a key enzyme of glycine betaine catabolism [65]. Glycine betaine concentrations decrease under hypo-saline stress in the marine alga Platymonas subcordiformis [66], consistent with this compound acting as an osmoticum. Interestingly, the concentration of the organic sulfur compound dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), a well-known osmolyte in plants which increases in corals under heat stress [28], also increased under hypo-saline conditions during our study [30], suggesting that DMSP is unlikely to act as an osmolyte in corals, but rather as a scavenger of ROS and molecular sink for excess methionine.In a range of marine invertebrates, including the sea anemone Metridium senile and the bivalve Noetia ponderosa [15, 16], free amino acid (FAA) levels also decrease in response to hypo-osmotic stress. However, the limited body of work on FAA metabolism in corals is not consistent with this trend (as it was found to increase in the coral A. aspera during hypo-saline stress [19]). The data presented here suggest that amino acid catabolism increased under hypo-saline stress, leading to increased ammonia production (GDH up-regulated, Fig. 3), but measurements of amino acid levels are needed to confirm osmolyte responses under hypo-saline stress.Whereas previous work on salinity stress has focused on adult corals, this is the first investigation to consider both adult and juvenile corals. Since the juveniles were aposymbiotic, the response of juveniles documented here permits insights into molecular mechanisms operating in the coral animal in the absence of metabolic contributions [67] from endosymbiotic Symbiodiniaceae. Therefore, an important caveat in interpreting these results is that the presence/absence of endosymbiont in adults/juveniles. Despite this difference, after 24\u2009h of osmotic stress, many aspects of the response were common between the adults and juveniles - for example, genes involved in adjusting cell volume (e.g., transporters, betaine catabolism). Several genes involved in amino acid metabolism also responded in the same way in both juveniles and adults (Fig. 3), and of particular interest was the increase of BHMT, an enzyme involved in methionine biosynthesis, at both time points, with a maximum change after 48\u2009h in the juveniles (Additional file 4: Table S5; 4.04 Log2FC; FDR 0). This observation could be linked to increases in DMSP production observed with both life history stages during this experiment [30], since methionine is a precursor of DMSP. By contrast, the antioxidant system was up-regulated in adults and largely unaffected by hypo-osmotic stress in juveniles (Additional file 4: Table S4). This result could be explained as the adult corals have evolved mechanisms to withstand ROS produced by their endosymbionts [68].In the case of juveniles, significantly fewer genes were differentially expressed after 48\u2009h compared to 24\u2009h of exposure to hypo-saline conditions, with the return to baseline levels of many of the genes implicated in proteolysis and osmoregulation suggesting a degree of acclimation had occurred after 48\u2009h. A precedent for this is provided by the work of Moya et al. [24] on the response of A. millepora juveniles to elevated CO2, where short term (3 d) exposure to elevated CO2 caused changes in the expression of multiple genes, most of which returned to baseline levels after 9 d of exposure. Whilst these results suggest the possibility of acclimation to hypo-saline stress after 48\u2009h, experiments with longer exposure times are needed to understand if this response is maintained and how such treatments impact coral physiology.During extreme floods, such as occurred on the GBR in 2010\u20132011, shallow reefs (<\u20095\u2009m) were exposed to salinity below 25 PSU for up to 15\u2009days [12]. The frequency and severity of heavy rainfall events are predicted to increase by 2050 [69, 70], leading to corresponding increases in the exposure of adult and juvenile corals to hypo-saline conditions. The data presented here highlight specific pathways involved in the molecular response of corals to salinity stress, and imply that juvenile corals may have the ability to adjust to hypo-saline conditions during heavy rainfall events. However, longer term experiments, combined with physiological and proteomic analyses, should be a high priority.AminopeptidaseBetaine-aldehyde dehydrogenaseBetaine-homocysteine methyltransferaseDimethylglycine dehydrogenaseGlutamate dehydrogenase (NADH)Glutamate dehydrogenase (NADPH)Gamma-glutamyltranspeptidaseGlycine N-methyltransferaseGlutamate synthaseGlutathione peroxidaseGlutamine synthetaseGlutathione reductaseGlutathione S-transferaseMethionine synthaseMethylenetetrahydrofolate reductaseOrnithine--oxo-acid transaminaseProline dehydrogenasePractical salinity unitsSarcosine dehydrogenaseSerine hydroxymethyltransferaseThreonine aldolaseCA gratefully acknowledges receipt of an AIMS@JCU scholarship, and the work was supported by the Australian Research Council via the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies.

PCA of the count matrix of the 26,622 A. millepora gene predictions revealed that the colony (i.e. genotype) had a stronger effect on gene expression than the salinity treatment for the adult corals, while in the case of juveniles (where genotype effects could not be accounted for) variation was primarily explained by treatment (Additional file 1: Figure S1). After 1\u2009h of salinity stress, 2657 genes were differentially expressed in adults (DEGs; FDR\u2009<\u20090.05), increasing to 3713 after 24\u2009h of exposure (Additional file 2: Figure S2). Whilst 3462 genes were differentially expressed in the juveniles after 24\u2009h of salinity stress, this number decreased to 1485 after 48\u2009h of stress (Additional file 2: Figure S2). At the 24\u2009h time point, adults and juveniles shared 38% of up-regulated genes (total number: 1707; FDR <\u20090.05) and 31% of down-regulated genes (total number: 1755; FDR <\u20090.05; see Additional file 3: Figure S3). Moreover, the overall response to salinity stress included 98 genes that were differentially expressed in both adults and juveniles at both time points, amongst which were several genes involved in amino acid metabolism discussed below (Fig. 1, Additional file 4: Table S1).\n\nFig. 1\nHeatmap (log2FC) summarising expression relative to 35 PSU controls of the suite of 98 genes which responded (FDR\u2009<\u20090.05) in all four salinity treatments. As indicated above the corresponding columns in the heatmap, the treatments were: 1\u2009h (25 PSU) adults; 24\u2009h (25 PSU) adults; 1\u2009h (28 PSU) juveniles; 48\u2009h (28 PSU) juveniles. The dendrogram on the left of the figure shows clustering based on similarity of expression pattern. To the right of the figure, the 12 most highly up-regulated genes are listed, those in bold being components of the free amino acid cycle (Additional file 4: Table S5). These 12 genes constitute a well resolved clade at the top of the heat map. For the complete list of genes IDs refer to Additional file 4: Table S1. The colour scale bar indicates up (red) or down-regulation (blue) relative to the control\nThere was an up-regulation of several genes involved in ER-associated degradation (ERAD, ko04141) and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) after 24\u2009h of hypo-saline stress in the adults, while many of the same genes were down-regulated under acute (1\u2009h) salinity stress (Fig. 2; Additional file 4: Table S3). The ER pathway involves several processes, including: protein folding and translocation into the ER lumen, degradation of misfolded proteins through the ERAD system and proteolysis through the UPS. Amongst the genes up-regulated after 24\u2009h were coral homologues of genes responsible for translocation into the ER lumen; the oligosaccharyl transferase (OST) and SEC61 protein transport systems. Genes involved in protein glycosylation also showed increased expression after 24\u2009h; for example, glucosidase II (GlcII) increased by 0.66 log2FC (FDR 8.95E-06, Additional file 4: Table S3), and UDP-glucose/glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) increased by 0.59 log2FC (FDR 8.82E-04). Moreover, luminal chaperones and co-chaperones were also up-regulated at 24\u2009h, including the HSP70 family member GRP70, also known as binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP; 1.2.4351.m1; 1.3 log2FC; FDR 8.64E-19 at 24\u2009h), along with the BiP co-chaperones ERdj1, ERdj3 and ERdj6 (DnaJ Hsp40 family members; 1.2.7940.m1, 1.2.25530.m1, 1.2.21656.m1). Increased expression was also observed for members of the ERAD retrotranslocon complexes, including the endoplasmic reticulum lectin 1 (XTP3B, 1.2.21359.m1), heat shock protein 90\u2009kDa (GRP94, 1.2.15211.m1), translocating chain-associated membrane protein (TRAM, 1.2.11248.m1), and the translocon-associated protein (TRAP, 1.2.3165.m1).\n\nFig. 2\nDifferential expression of A. millepora homologues of components of the ER protein processing machinery (pathway 04141) after exposure of adult corals to 1 and 24\u2009h of hypo-saline conditions.

Figure adapted from KEGG pathway database\nGenes involved in the peroxisomal antioxidant system that showed increased expression after 24\u2009h of hypo-saline stress include: two superoxide dismutases (SOD, by 0.41 and 0.43 log2FC; FDR 1.07E-02 and 4.68E-02), two catalases (CAT, by 0.49 and 1.44 log2FC; FDR 1.93E-31 and 1.96E-02), and five glutathione S-transferases (GST, EC:2.5.1.18) (Additional file 4: Table S3, S4). The glutathione (GSH) redox system also plays an important role in protection against oxidative damage. It comprises the enzymes glutathione peroxidase (GPx, EC 1.11.1.9) (oxidizing GSH to glutathione disulphide (GSSG)), and glutathione reductase (GSR) (reducing GSSG back to glutathione). During hypo-saline stress, the GSR homologue was up-regulated after 24\u2009h, while the GPx homologue was down-regulated after 1 and 24\u2009h of stress by \u2212\u20090.38 and\u2009\u2212\u20091.08 log2FC respectively (FDR 1.30E-03 and 7.61E-10; Fig. 3; Additional file 4: Table S5), indicating a balance towards GSH reduction.\n\nFig. 3\nExpression of A. millepora homologues of genes involved in amino acid metabolism during hypo-osmotic stress in adult and juvenile corals.

Additional file 4: Table S5, provides the complete list of genes involved in this pathway and details of expression levels\nHypo-saline stress induces expression of antioxidant defences that are protective against the reactive oxygen species (ROS) that arise in corals (and other organisms) as a result of a range of environmental stressors [40]. In the present study components of the general antioxidant repertoire of corals (catalases, superoxide dismutases and thioredoxin) that respond to thermal and to elevated CO2 stress [14, 24, 25, 41] were also found to respond to hypo-saline stress (Table 1). A second group of genes involved in general stress responses is the HSP family. For some time, HSPs have been investigated in the context of responses of corals to thermal stress [42\u201344], but the HSP repertoire has only recently been properly described in A. millepora, allowing comprehensive analyses of the response of this complex gene family to stress [24]. Whereas multiple HSP90 and HSP70 variants are present in corals, some of which can respond to a range of stressors [14, 25, 42, 45], specific HSPs appear to respond to most types of stress. For example, Moya et al. [24, 46] identified a specific A. millepora HSP70 that also responded to high CO2 and whose A. hyacinthus orthologue was involved in thermal tolerance [47]. Consistent with a role in the general stress response, this same HSP70 responded to hypo-saline conditions in the present study (1.2.19257.m1, 2.54 log2FC; FDR 3.42E-10 at 24\u2009h, Table 1).Table 1\nComparison between genes that are differentially expressed in A. millepora adults under hyposaline conditions and other published gene expression or proteomic studies\n\n\nAdditional file 1\nFigure S1.

In this study we derived the high-resolution population structure and levels of autozygosity of 377 Lipizzan horses originating from five different European stud farms utilizing the SNP genotype information of the high density 700\u2009k Affymetrix Axiom\u2122 Equine genotyping array. Scanning the genome for overlapping runs of homozygosity (ROH) shared by more than 50% of horses, we identified homozygous regions (ROH islands) in order to investigate the gene content of those candidate regions by gene ontology and enrichment analyses.The high-resolution population network approach revealed well-defined substructures according to the origin of the horses (Austria, Slovakia, Croatia and Hungary). The highest mean genome coverage of ROH (SROH) was identified in the Austrian (SROH\u2009=\u2009342.9), followed by Croatian (SROH\u2009=\u2009214.7), Slovakian (SROH\u2009=\u2009205.1) and Hungarian (SROH\u2009=\u2009171.5) subpopulations. ROH island analysis revealed five common islands on ECA11 and ECA14, hereby confirming a closer genetic relationship between the Hungarian and Croatian as well as between the Austrian and Slovakian samples. Private islands were detected for the Hungarian and the Austrian Lipizzan subpopulations. All subpopulations shared a homozygous region on ECA11, nearly identical in position and length containing among other genes the homeobox-B cluster, which was also significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.001) highlighted by enrichment analysis. Gene ontology terms were mostly related to biological processes involved in embryonic morphogenesis and anterior/posterior specification. Around the STX17 gene (causative for greying), we identified a ROH island harbouring the genes NR4A3, STX17, ERP44 and INVS. Within further islands on ECA14, ECA16 and ECA20 we detected the genes SPRY4, NDFIP1, IMPDH2, HSP90AB1, whereas SPRY4 and HSP90AB1 are involved in melanoma metastasis and survival rate of melanoma patients in humans.We demonstrated that the assessment of high-resolution population structures within one single breed supports the downstream genetic analyses (e.g. the identification of ROH islands). By means of ROH island analyses, we identified the genes SPRY4, NDFIP1, IMPDH2, HSP90AB1, which might play an important role for further studies on equine melanoma. Furthermore, our results highlighted the impact of the homeobox-A and B cluster involved in morphogenesis of Lipizzan horses.The Lipizzan horse breed is globally one of the best-documented horse population, as pedigree records can be traced back to the known founder animals born in the early eighteenth century. The founder population, described in detail by Zechner et al. [1], Druml and S\u00f6lkner [2] and Druml et al. [3], comprises 456 animals, whereas the major part of horses originated from the former imperial stud farm of Lipica founded in the year 1580. Since the First World War the stud book of Lipizzan horses is closed and presently conservation breeding strategies are applied by eleven state stud farms located in nine European countries. National Lipizzan breeding herds have limited population sizes; therefore, maintenance of genetic diversity has been in the focus of state stud farms over decennia.Numerous genetic approaches and methods have been applied to characterise the gene pool, the genetic diversity and the population structure of the Lipizzan breed. Comprehensive pedigree data (max. 31 generations, generation equivalent 19.1) were used to estimate inbreeding coefficients and effective population sizes by Zechner et al. [1], S\u00f6lkner and Druml [2] and Druml et al. [3]. Furthermore, microsatellite markers were employed to describe diversity measures, genetic distances and population structure by Achmann et al. [4]. Kavar et al. [5, 6] investigated mtDNA maternal diversity; Kasarda et al. [7] estimated genetic relatedness between Old Kladruber, Slovenian and Slovakian Lipizzans, whilst Wallner et al. [8] highlighted the patrilinear structure conducting haplotype-based analyses of the Y-chromosome. Most of these scientific publications arose from a multilateral research project, which is described in the review by Dovc et al. [9]. Based upon this scientific project further research was conducted focusing on the inheritance of melanoma, vitiligo and greying [10\u201313].In this study we used the SNP genotype information of the Affymetrix Axiom\u2122 Equine genotyping array [14] to analyse the high-resolution population structure of Lipizzan horses originating from five different European stud farms, which differ in breeding history and breeding objectives. To ascertain the high-resolution population structure of the gene pool, we applied a recently described three-step procedure as presented in Druml et al. [15], which includes individual levels of admixture and genomic inbreeding (ROH) in the final population network visualization. After the assessment of the high-resolution population structure, we identified overlapping homozygous regions (ROH islands) within the entire population and respective subpopulations, and conducted a gene ontology and enrichment analysis of annotated genes located within ROH islands. We demonstrate that the combination of different approaches elaborate insights in population structure and underlying differences in levels of autozygosity and distribution of ROH islands.The first level (K\u2009=\u20092) of model-based clustering using the programme Admixture separated the Austrian population from the other Lipizzan samples (Fig. 1b). At the second level of clustering K\u2009=\u20093 the Hungarian sample were allocated in a distinct cluster. Further increasing K to 4 and 5 the Austrian subpopulation was further sub-structured, whilst at K\u2009=\u20096 the Slovakian sample formed a distinct cluster. At the additional levels of K\u2009=\u20097 and K\u2009=\u20098 the identified subpopulations were subsequently sub-structured. The visualization of the cross-validation (CV) error for each K, increasing K from 2 to 10, did not result in an optimal number of clusters (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02).The Croatian sample was separated from the Austrian sample, connected directly by one cross-link animal. The network analysis identified three sub-clusters within the Croatian sample. According to pedigree information, the cluster on the right involved horses from the stud farm Lipik, whilst the left cluster represented the core population from the stud farm \u0110akovo. The accumulation in the middle of the Croatian sample included horses from \u0110akovo, which showed high levels of admixture with horses from Lipik, as well as with Slovakian and Hungarian Lipizzans, respectively. The Hungarian sample was characterised by the highest genetic distances between the samples and by the lowest SROH values, indicating genealogical separation between Hungarian and Austrian Lipizzans. The Slovakian sample showed genetic relationships in both directions \u2013 to the Austrian and to the Croatian samples. These relationships were illustrated by manifold cross-link animals, which had small SROH values and higher degree of admixture connecting both clusters.ROH parameters varied between samples. Highest estimates of SROH and NROH were identified for horses originating from the stud farm of Piber/Austria (SROH\u2009=\u2009342.88\u2009Mb; NROH\u2009=\u2009211.85), followed by the Croatian horses (SROH\u2009=\u2009214.66\u2009Mb; NROH\u2009=\u2009186.87) and Slovakian horses (SROH\u2009=\u2009205.06\u2009Mb; NROH\u2009=\u2009187.58). Lowest SROH and NROH were found in the Hungarian sample (SROH\u2009=\u2009171.53\u2009Mb; NROH\u2009=\u2009158.39) (Table 1). Five Austrian Lipizzan horses reached the highest SROH with more than 500\u2009Mb, whereas the smallest SROH were detected in three Hungarian Lipizzan horses (1.91\u2009Mb to 20\u2009Mb).ROH patterns as revealed by the plot NROH versus SROH indicate for the majority of the Piber population a strong right shift towards a higher SROH and an increased variance of SROH (Additional file 3). The samples of Slovakia and Croatia were distributed along the diagonal, whereas in the left corner of the plot a cluster of 11 horses with the lowest ROH parameters can be observed, indicating out-breeding. These horses were also clearly identified as cross-link animals between stud farms within the high-resolution population network (Fig. 2).Concerning the distribution of ROH segments of different length categories, the Austrian Lipizzan population is characterized by the lowest proportion of ROH smaller than 2\u2009Mb (21.3%), which varied in the other samples between 31.1 and 32.3% (Table 2). At the same time the Austrian horses had the highest proportion of ROHs longer than 6\u2009Mb (19.2%). In the other samples this ROH category was present at an amount from 1.4 to 3.2%. In the Austrian sample 7.4% of ROHs were longer than 10\u2009Mb, whereas in the other samples this category was underrepresented at a percentage of <\u20090.6%.The second ROH island on ECA11 (position 31,015.821 - 31,942.748) was up to 927\u2009kb long in Austrian and Croatian samples and was shared by 72.8 and 62.6% of the horses, respectively (Fig.\u00a03b). The Slovakian Lipizzans had two overlapping homozygous segments in this region. Within the Hungarian sample, 47.0% of horses shared a much smaller island, which was directly located in the Musashi RNA binding protein 2 (MSI2).The island on ECA4 at position 58.11\u201358.62\u2009Mb was also present in the Hungarian Lipizzans and contained among other annotated genes the homeobox-A cluster (HOXA). Furthermore, an island on ECA22 at position 47.90\u201348.62\u2009Mb was exclusively detected within the Croatian and Slovakian sample.Gene ontology and enrichment analysis highlighted within all Lipizzan samples the homeobox-B cluster, where the highest significance levels (p\u2009<\u20090.001) were reached for the terms GO:0048704~embryonic skeletal system morphogenesis and GO:0009952~anterior/posterior pattern specification (Additional\u00a0file\u00a04). Further the term GO:0043565~sequence-specific DNA binding related to molecular functions reached a significance level of p\u2009<\u20090.001 for the entire Lipizzan sample. Three out of 20 genes located in the identified ROH islands were listed in OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) database (DGKE - 615,008~Hemolytic uremic syndrome; HOXB1\u2013614744~Facial paresis; SPRY4\u2013615266~Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), but none of the identified genes were listed in OMIA (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals) database for horses.In the Austrian Lipizzan population (Additional\u00a0file\u00a05) GO analysis confirmed the aforementioned terms in biological processes (GO:0048704 and GO:0009952 containing the HOXB cluster), and highlighted additionally the five terms GO:0021570~rhombomere 4 development, GO:0021612~facial nerve structural, GO:0006183~GTP biosynthetic process, GO:0006950~response to stress and GO:0071353~cellular response to interleukin-4, related to biological processes.The Slovakian Lipizzans (Additional\u00a0file\u00a06) where characterized by three specific terms related to biological processes: GO:0048864~stem cell development, GO:0001525~angiogenesis, GO:0006368~transcription elongation from RNA polymerase II promoter.GO analysis revealed 12 identical terms, related to biological processes for the Hungarian and Croatian samples and additionally two sample specific terms (GO:0006355~regulation of transcription, DNA-templated; GO:0001578~microtubule bundle formation) for the Hungarian and three terms for the Croatian sample (GO:0007156~homophilic cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion molecules; GO:0050890~cognition; GO:0001759~organ induction) (Additional\u00a0files\u00a07 and 8). All these 12 terms related to biological processes are based upon the HOXB- and HOXA-clusters. The highest significance levels (p\u2009<\u20090.001) were found in concordance with the other samples for GO:0009952~anterior/posterior pattern specification and GO:0048704~embryonic skeletal system morphogenesis. Summarizing the results from gene ontology analysis of these two samples a high number of terms were highlighted for different aspects of embryonic morphogenesis (f.e. GO:0009953~dorsal/ventral pattern formation, GO:0009954~proximal/distal pattern formation, GO:0008584~male gonad development, GO:0060065~uterus development, GO:0021615~glossopharyngeal nerve morphogenesis).Two islands in the entire sample and six islands in the Austrian Lipizzans were remarkable short (8.0\u2013101.1\u2009kb length) and matched in size with single genes. One short island on ECA3:118.67\u2013118.77\u2009Mb (length 101.1kb) directly overlapped with the genes UVSSA (UV-stimulated scaffold protein A) and MAEA (macrophage erythroblast attacher) and was shared by 50.8% of the Austrian horses. 76\u2009kb upstream a second ROH island (ECA3:118.80\u2013118.89\u2009Mb, length 83.9kb) was centred on the CTBP1 gene (C-terminal binding protein 1), that was shared by 50.2% of Austrian Lipizzans. To examine levels of homozygosity for SNPs located within the three named genes, we extracted the following SNPs from the entire sample: UVSSA: AX-104358355 Pos.:118,712.729, AX-104277358 Pos.:118,716.414, AX-103191894 Pos.:118,724.527, AX-104669126 Pos.:118,727.858; MAEA: AX-104046583 Pos.:118,750.308, AX-104041685 Pos.:118,752.167; CTBP1: AX-103592395 Pos.:118,874.036. The four SNPs within UVSSA revealed homozygosity for 78.2% of individuals. For the two SNPs located in MAEA 90.5% of animals were homozygous in the Austrian population and 78.5% of the horses were homozygous for these SNPs within the entire sample. At the SNP located in CTBP1 all horses of the entire sample were homozygous.The high-resolution population network (Admixture and Netview analysis) of the Lipizzan horse breed revealed that the single stud farms represent differentiated subpopulations, whereas the highest genetic distances were observed between the Austrian and the Hungarian/Croatian samples. The Slovakian Lipizzans clustered between the Austrian and the Croatian Lipizzans. These findings are in concordance with Achmann et al. [4], who derived a comparable structure for 561 Lipizzans from seven European countries. In the present study the Austrian and Slovakian horses were characterized by a lower genetic distances and higher pairwise relationship coefficients compared to the Croatian and Hungarian animals. This can be explained by the limited census of breeding animals in the Slovakian stud farm Topol\u2019\u010dianky, and the limited level of introgression of horses into the Austrian breeding herd. Due to the obligatory performance test of stallions in the Spanish riding school, in the Austrian stud farm Piber only foreign mares can be used to increase genetic diversity, whereas in Hungary, Slovakia and Croatia an exchange of breeding stallions is commonly applied. At the same time the Croatian and Hungarian breeding stock has been bigger than the Slovakian one.Generally genetic distances between horses, illustrated in the high-resolution network visualization, was relatively equally distributed within the breeding herds of Piber and Topol\u2019\u010dianky and no outstanding contribution of single animals (key-contributor) were detected, revealing the efforts of a conservation breeding program with narrow sex ratios and moderate selection intensity. Between Piber, Szilvasv\u00e1rad and Topol\u2019\u010dianky cross-link animals were found, which showed markedly smaller mean genome-wide coverage of ROH and a higher degree of admixture. A comparable \u201coutbreeding-effect\u201d was detected in a previous study in the Haflinger breed, where outcrosses between horses from different countries/stud books were characterised by low SROH and the lack of ROHs >\u20096\u2009Mb [15].All ROH parameters observed in our four subpopulations, reached highest values in the Austrian Lipizzans, whereas the lowest values were found in the Hungarian sample. The values of FROH generally were in concordance with the findings of pedigree analyses from Zechner et al. [1] and did not exceed 15%. Genomic inbreeding, as described by FROH in the Lipizzan breed (FROH\u2009=\u20090.13) was lower than expected from long-term stud farm breeding at small census and it is comparable to values found in the Austrian Haflinger (0.13), the Slovenian Haflinger (0.12) and the Bosnian Mountain Horse (0.14) [15, 16]. Higher levels of FROH were identified in Shagya Arabians (FROH\u2009=\u20090.16) and Purebred Arabians (FROH\u2009=\u20090.18), two breeds characterized by early closure of stud books [15].The length of ROHs is expected to correlate to ancient and recent inbreeding due to number of recombination events. Thus, recent inbreeding events result in longer ROHs as only a few identical by descent (IBD) segments can be broken down by repeated meiosis. According to Browning and Browning [17] and Thompson [18] ROHs of a length of 16.6, 10.0 and 5.0\u2009Mb are assumed to origin from common ancestors back in the 3rd, 5th and 10th generations (6, 10 and 20 meioses respectively). Considering a mean generation interval of 10 years in Lipizzan horses the origin of ROHs in length class of <\u20092\u2009Mb can be dated to the foundation period of this breed (foundation time 1580\u2009AC). We observed FROH values calculated based upon ROHs shorter than 2\u2009Mb ranging from 5.6 to 7.1%. FROH\u2009>\u200910Mb was absent in Slovakian Lipizzans and tended toward zero in Croatian and Hungarian horses, indicating minimal recent inbreeding within the past five generations [18, 19]. In the Austrian population FROH\u2009>\u200910Mb reached 1.1%. These results demonstrated that it is feasible to minimize the increase of inbreeding in populations limited in size and closed stud books. The ROH profile illustration for the Austrian Lipizzan revealed a strong right shift and a higher variance typical for consanguineous and bottlenecked populations according to Ceballos et al. [20]. The Slovakian sample was characterized by a similar profile, but at a much lower extend, whereas the Croatian and Hungarian samples showed the effects of small census [20].The identification of overlapping homozygous regions confirmed a closer genetic relationship between the Hungarian and Croatian samples as well as between the Austrian and Slovakian samples, which was also highlighted within the high-resolution population network. Private islands were detected for the Hungarian sample on ECA8, ECA14, ECA23 and ECA30 and for the Austrian sample on ECA3, ECA5, ECA8, ECA16 and ECA20. Within the Austrian Lipizzans an overlapping 953.3kb long homozygous region on ECA16:37.87\u201338.82\u2009Mb was found, that contained among 29 annotated genes the two genes ECATH-3 and ECATH-2. Both were described as functional genes encoding Cathelicidin-derived antimicrobial peptides, involved in the peptide-based host defence of neutrophils and epithelia in horses [21, 22]. GO analysis for the Austrian Lipizzan gene list highlighted the term GO:0006950~response to stress for the gene UCN2 (urocortin 2, a member of the corticotropin-releasing hormone family) on ECA16 and the gene HSP90AB1 (Equus caballus heat shock protein 90 alpha family class B member 1) on ECA20, whereas the latter was assigned to four Equus caballus species by Vidale et al. [23]. HSP90AB1 is considered to play a role in the age-dependent metabolism of chondrocytes in horses [24].All subpopulations shared a homozygous region on ECA11, nearly identical in position and length (mean length 676.4\u2009kb) at 24.13\u201324.81\u2009Mb containing the annotated genes COPZ2, CBX1, SNX11, HOXB1, HOXB2, HOXB3, HOXB5, HOXB6, HOXB7, HOXB8, HOXB13, TTLL6 (and CALCOCO2, additional in the Hungarian sample). For the Croatian/Hungarian Lipizzans an additional island on ECA4:58.10\u201358.60\u2009Mb was confirmed containing the homeobox-A cluster. Enrichment analysis highlighted for all samples highly significant levels (p\u2009<\u20090.001) for the homeobox-B cluster, mostly related to biological processes involved in embryonic morphogenesis and anterior/posterior specification (GO:0009952, GO:0048704, GO:0009953, GO:0009954). Significant levels for GO terms based upon the HOXA cluster (GO:0060065~uterus development, GO:0009954~proximal/distal pattern formation, GO:0007338~single fertilization, GO:0008584~male gonad development) were exclusively documented for Croatian and Hungarian Lipizzans. The island on ECA11 including the HOXB cluster and highly significant GO terms related to morphogenesis were recently also documented in the Posavina horse by Grilz-Seger et al. [16]. Zhang et al. [25] listed HOXB13 in a recent selection signature study in horses. HOX genes play a fundamental role for morphological diversity in animals and for the control of axial morphology along the anterior-posterior body axis. As these gene clusters are directly assigned to axial body segments in numerical order, they can control single segments during embryogenesis concerning their position, segmentation and further differentiation [26].On ECA11:31.01\u201331.94 another common homozygous region was found in all samples, whereas the frequency in Hungarian Lipizzans was with 47% slightly below the threshold. This ROH island, nearly identical in length (926.9/910.2\u2009kb) in the Austrian and Croatian Lipizzans, harboured the genes C11H117orf67, DGKE, COIL, SCPEP1, AKAP1, MSI2 and was partially overlapping with two smaller islands of the Slovakian population. The Hungarian sample had a 244.4 long overlapping homozygous region within the Musashi RNA binding protein 2 (MSI2), which is involved in stem cell proliferation [27], haematopoiesis and can promote aggressive myeloid leukaemia in humans [28]. Four of these genes (COIL, SCPEP1, AKAP1, MSI2) were listed among other 121 genes that underwent positive selection during the domestication process of the horse [29].In general the majority of ROH islands were medium sized (between 100 and 900\u2009kb) to small sized (8\u2013100\u2009kb) according to the classification of Pemperton et al. [30]. Only in the Croatian sample one island on ECA14 was longer than 1\u2009Mb. Most of the short ROH islands did not exceed the length of the contained gene, e.g. the island on ECA3:118.66\u2013118.76\u2009Mb, containing the two genes UV-stimulated scaffold protein A (UVSSA) and macrophage erythroblast attacher (MAEA). UVSSA is involved into the repair process of DNA damaged by ultraviolet (UV) sun rays. These two genes were directly followed by a 83\u2009kb long island containing the gene C-terminal-binding protein 1 (CTBP1), a transcriptional co-repressor. Pemperton et al. [30] emphasized the investigation of short ROHs (<\u2009100\u2009kb), as they reflect homozygosity for ancient haplotypes contributing to local linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns. Intermediary ROHs longer than 100\u2009kb up to 2.5\u2009Mb are deemed to be the result from background relatedness in populations with limited census. Furthermore, Pemperton et al. [30] stated that by the commonly applied windows approach as implemented in PLINK [31], ancient haplotypes and small ROHs due to high recombination rate might remain undetected. With the 500\u2009kb applied boundary we were able to detect very small ROH islands, but SNP extraction revealed, that the frequencies of animals sharing those islands were underestimated, exemplarily demonstrated for the genes MAEA, UVSSA, CTBP1 and the STX17 locus.Grey coat color, caused by a 4.6\u2009kb duplication in intron 6 of Syntaxin 17 (STX17), is an essential part of the breeding objective in Lipizzan horses and it has been under selection since the past 150\u2009years. The STX17 mutation is embedded into 352\u2009kb long haplotype [13, 32].The frequency of the identified ROH island (ECA25:6,39-6,79) harbouring the genes STX17, NR4A3, ERP44 and INVS, was in concordance with genotype frequencies cited in Pielberg et al. [13], and ranged from 51.1% (Croatia) to 71.2% (Austria) among the respective subpopulations. In the Austrian breeding program only grey horses are used for reproduction, whilst the Slovakian, Hungarian and Croatian stud farms also permit solid colored horses. As a consequence the proportion of homozygous grey G/G horses is higher in the Austrian population.The allele status of STX17 influences the progression of greying by age, grade of speckling (pigmentation among grey hair), grade of vitiligo and incidences and grade of melanoma [10\u201313]. The incidence of melanoma in Lipizzans was reported to affect 80% of the animals older than 15\u2009years [10, 13]. Mostly melanomas in Lipizzans are benign and do not metastasize [33]. A previous study revealed, that the genes STX17, NR4A3, ERP44 and INVS, which are located in the aforementioned ROH island also were expressed in melanoma tissues [13]. Pielberg et al. [13] observed an over-expression of NR4A3 (nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 3), which is influenced by the dominant G-allele. The underlying molecular processes are not clearly understood [34]. Seltenhammer et al. [33] investigated factors retarding metastasis in affected grey Lipizzan horses and revealed common features with blue nevi in humans and identified potential markers for equine melanoma (S-100, PCNA, HMB-45, Ki-67, T-311, CD44). We identified within the entire Lipizzan sample an island on ECA14 containing the genes SPRY4 (Sprouty4) and NDFI1 (Nedd4-family interacting protein 1). SPYR4 is a member of the SPYR proteins, which are negative regulators of growth factor signaling pathways. Thus, SPRY4 inhibits transformed cell growth, migration and invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition [35]. Shaverdashvili et al. [36] provided evidence in human melanoma for an inverse relationship between the expression of SPYR4 and Membrane-type 1 Matrix Metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), one important driver of melanoma metastasis. Inhibition of MT1-MMP resulted in increased expression of SPYR4 and was correlated with the survival of melanoma patients in humans. NDFIP1 also acts as a tumour suppressor by repressing cell proliferation and was reported to be down-regulated in human uveal melamoma [37]. In a previous study Jiang et al. [34] investigated the ERK pathway and studied the effects of BRAF, RAS, GNAQ, GNA11, KIT on melanoma development in grey horses, whereas an association between STX17 and an activation of the ERK pathway was shown, but no activation of the aforementioned genes were observed. In the Austrian Lipizzan sample we identified an island containing the gene HSP90AB1. Metri et al. [38] identified HSP90AB1 as a main discriminator between metastatic and primary melanoma in humans, which also was correlated with survival rate of melanoma patients. In our data GO analysis revealed an enrichment of HSP90AB1 in the terms GO:0069550-reponse to stress and GO:0071353-cellular response to interleukin-4.The enhanced high-resolution Netview approach results in a generally understandable visualisation, which is able to simultaneously present fundamental metrics of genetic diversity, coancestry and relatedness on population and individual level. This approach thus provides a high practical impact for conventional and conservation breeding management. The analyses of ROH islands based upon the conventional ROH size boundary of >\u2009=\u2009500\u2009kb have proven to be a valuable approach to screen for signatures of selection, also able to detect short homozygous overlapping regions. In order to avoid an underestimation of the frequencies of very short ROHs the underlying size boundary should be adapted in regions of special interest. The investigation of subpopulations within one single breed allows a fine-scale analysis and we demonstrated that slightly different breeding objectives have a high impact on genomic regions and gene content. ROH island analyses identified several annotated genes (SPRY4, NDFIP1, HSP90AB1 and IMPDH2), which may play a role for further studies on equine melanoma.This study was discussed and approved by the institutional Commission for Ethics and Animal Welfare, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, protocol number: ETK-06/05/2015, in accordance with GSP guidelines and national legislation. The Lipizzan state stud farms Piber (Austria), Topol\u2019\u010dianky (Slovakia), Lipik, \u0110akovo (Croatia) and Szilvasv\u00e1rad (Hungary) granted the permission to take hair samples from their horses.The horses included in this study originated from five European state stud farms, which are located in four different countries. The Austrian and the Slovakian samples represent the entire breeding populations of the stud farm of Piber (Austria, 254 horses) and Topol\u2019\u010dianky (Slovakia, 55 horses). The Croatian Lipizzans were sampled from the state stud farms Lipik (8 horses) and \u0110akovo (37 horses), whilst 23 Lipizzan horses were collected from the Hungarian state stud farm Szilvasv\u00e1rad.The hair samples were taken between the years 2013 and 2017 and the selected horses were born between 1989 and 2014. For Austria and Slovakia we were able to collect the whole stud farm populations. The breeding stock of the Croatian stud farms comprises together approximately 120 breeding animals, the number in the Hungarian state stud farm is on a similar level.The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes for the 377 horses were determined using the Affymetrix Axiom\u2122 Equine genotyping array [14]. The chromosomal position of the SNPs was derived from EquCab2.0 reference genome. We excluded SNPs positioned on the sex chromosomes (X: 28,017 SNPs and Y: 1 SNP), SNPs without known chromosomal position (30,864 SNPs) and SNPs with more than 10% missing genotypes, resulting in a total of 611,914 SNPs for each horse. For the analysis of population structure and genetic diversity we excluded SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) less than 0.01, resulting in 492,719 SNPs per horse.In order to illustrate the population structure we applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on basis of the genetic relationship matrix (G) with pairwise identities by state (IBS) between horses as provided by PLINK v.1.7 [31]. The PCA was performed using R platform, whilst pairwise FST values were calculated with the R package Geneland (https://rdrr.io/cran/Geneland).Population clustering and admixture analysis were determined using the program Admixture 1.23 [39]. We ran Admixture for 100 iterations increasing K from 2 to 10. Convergence between independent runs at the same K was monitored by comparing the resulting log-likelihood scores (LLs) following 100 iterations, and was inferred from stabilized LLs with less than 1 LL unit of variation between runs. Cross validation (CV) error estimation for each K was performed to determine the optimal number of clusters. Admixture results were visualized with the program Distruct 1.1 [40] and integrated in the high-resolution network following the procedure of Druml et al. [15].ROH were determined with an overlapping window approach implemented in PLINK v1.7 [31] based on the settings: minimum SNP density\u2009=\u2009one SNP per 50\u2009kb; maximum gap length\u2009=\u2009100\u2009kb; minimum length of homozygous segment >\u2009500\u2009kb (including more than 80 homozygous SNPs); one heterozygote and two missing genotypes were permitted within each segment.,whereas the length of the autosomal genome (LAUTO), was set to 2243\u2009GB. Statistical analyses and graphical representations of specific genomic regions and distribution of ROH segments were performed using the R-package detectROHs (www.r-project.org)and SAS v.9.1. [41].In order to ascertain the high-resolution population structure of Lipizzan horses, we performed a network visualization based upon the aforementioned IBS derived relationship matrix (G), following the description of Druml et al. [15]. The different components involved in the so-called NetView approach are described in detail by Neuditschko et al. [42] and Steining et al. [43]. Briefly, we computed genetic distances by subtracting pairwise relationships from 1 and applied the algorithm in its default setting (number of k nearest neighbors k-NN\u2009=\u200910). To illustrate the genetic relatedness between neighboring horses, we associated the thickness of edges (connecting lines) with the proportion of the genetic distance, whilst thicker edges corresponding to lower genetic distances. To identify highly inbred and outcrossed horses within the respective population networks we scaled the node size of each horse based on the individual SROH. The node colors of each horse represent the individual level of admixture at the selected number of K-clusters, whilst the node border colors illustrate the origin of the horses.The distribution of ROH segments across the genome was visualized using the R-package detect ROHs (www.r-project.org). Putative ROH islands were determined based upon overlapping homozygous regions, which were shared by more than 50% of the horses. ROH islands were calculated for the entire data sample and respective subpopulations. Genes located in ROH regions were identified with the map viewer of the equine ensemble database EquCab2.0 (www.ensembl.org) and Gene Ontology (GO) terms and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways of annotated genes were analyzed using the open source Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) v6.8 package (https://david.ncifcrf.gov) using the

Based upon the visualization of the first three PCs the Austrian population is characterized by lower pairwise genetic distances and a distinct clustering. The other three subpopulations (Croatia, Hungary and Slovakia) appear to be highly interrelated simultaneously expressing a high level of genetic diversity, whilst a subset of the Austrian samples shares similarities with Croatian, Slovakian and Hungarian horses. FST analysis recapitulated these findings, as nearest relationships were documented for Austrian, Croatian and Slovakian samples (pairwise FST from 0.025 to 0.045), whereas the Hungarian subpopulation exhibited higher genetic differentiation (pairwise FST from 0.068 to 0.092) (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01).\n\nFig. 1\nVisualization of the dataset on the first 3 Principal Components (PCs) together explaining 35% of the variation. a On the left plot of PC1 and PC2; on the right plot of PC1 and PC3. b Graphical representation of individual cluster membership coefficients for Admixture runs increasing K\u2009=\u20092\u20138 for the Austrian, Croatian, Hungarian and Slovakian sample of Lipizzan horses\nUsing a high-resolution network graph we combined individual levels of SROH (see the results below) and individual levels of admixture (K\u2009=\u20098). The network analysis improved the assessment of the population structure, compared to PCA and Admixture, by clearly separating the horses according to their origin, simultaneously highlighting four population outliers (Fig.\u00a02). The horses of the stud farm Piber characteristically were connected by short and thick links, representing higher co-ancestry and lower genetic distance. The network highlighted two sub-clusters with higher levels of admixture, which were linked to Slovakian and Hungarian Lipizzans (marked with arrows in Fig. 2). According to pedigree information these cross-link animals were foreign bred mares, which were integrated into the Piber breeding population and thus are characterized by a lower co-ancestry level (longer and thinner links) and smaller SROH values (smaller node sizes).\n\nFig. 2\nHigh-resolution network visualisation of Lipizzan horses from the stud farms Piber (Austria), Topol\u2019\u010dianky (Slovakia), \u0110akovo and Lipik (Croatia) and Szilvasv\u00e1rad (Hungary). a On the top network the horses (nodes) are colored by stud farm. On the lower network (b) nodes are containing individual cluster membership coefficients from Admixture analysis.

Two arrows pinpoint sub-clusters in the Austrian sample\nIncluding the entire sample of Lipizzan horses in the ROH analysis the mean number of ROH (NROH) comprised 202.07 segments at a mean genome length covered by ROH (SROH) of 297.01\u2009Mb (+\u2009\u2212\u2009119.85), resulting in a mean ROH length (LROH) of 1.42\u2009Mb (Table\u00a01).Table 1\nMean values, standard deviation (SD), minimum and maximum values for the variables SROH (in Mb), NROH, LROH (in Mb) and FROH for the entire Lipizzan sample, the Austrian population sample of the stud farm Piber, the population of the Slovakian stud farm of Topol\u2019\u010dianky, the Croatian and the Hungarian sample\nInbreeding as defined by FROH reached a mean value of 13.2% (+\u2009\u2212\u20095.3%) within the entire sample, ranging from 15.3% (+\u2009\u2212\u20094.7%) in the Piber population to 7.6% (+\u2009\u2212\u20095.0%) in the Hungarian sample (Table 1). To differentiate old and recent inbreeding we calculated FROH based upon different ROH length classes (Table\u00a02). The values for FROH\u2009<\u20092Mb were highest in the Austrian (6.7%) and lowest in the Hungarian sample (5.6%). To quantify recent inbreeding we calculated FROH considering ROHs longer than 10\u2009MB. Recent inbreeding was absent in the Slovakian sample and tended to zero in the Hungarian sample, whereas the highest value of 1.1% was observed for the Austrian sample.Table 2\nDistribution of ROHs and FROH (in percent) in different length classes (0.5\u20131\u2009Mb, 1\u20132\u2009Mb, 2\u20134\u2009Mb, 4\u20136\u2009Mb, 6\u20138\u2009Mb, 8\u201310\u2009Mb, >\u200910\u2009Mb) respectively cumulative length classes (<\u20091\u2009Mb, <\u20092\u2009Mb, <\u20094\u2009Mb, <\u20096\u2009Mb, <\u20098\u2009Mb, <\u200910\u2009Mb, total FROH) for the Austrian, Croatian, Hungarian, Slovakian samples and the entire data set (All)\nWithin the entire dataset, we identified three ROH islands on ECA11 and two islands on ECA14, which were shared by more than 50% of the horses (Table\u00a03). The overlapping homozygous region on ECA11:24.13\u201324.81\u2009Mb was shared by 61.3% of animals and harboured the genes COPZ2, CBX1, SNX11, HOXB1, HOXB2, HOXB3, HOXB5, HOXB6, HOXB7, HOXB8, HOXB13, TTLL6. Figure\u00a03a illustrates this island and the position of the homeobox-B cluster (HOXB) for each sample separately. These overlapping homozygous regions were nearly identical in position and length in all samples and the frequency varied between 59.2% (Slovakia) and 72.7% (Hungary).Table 3\nROH islands, shared by more than 50% (ROH freq.) of the entire sample of Lipizzan horses and the annotated genes in corresponding regions\n\n\nFig. 3\na Plot of the ROH islands containing the HOXB cluster at ECA11:24.13\u201324.81\u2009Mb for each single sample.

This ROH island was embedded in the centre of a 1.38\u2009Mb long homozygous region at position ECA25:5.69\u20137.07\u2009Mb present in 36.6% of Lipizzan horses. The frequency was below our expectations. From a previous study, it is known that the STX17 genotype frequencies for homozygous G/G horses reached up to 67.3% in Lipizzans [13]. Scanning this region for ROHs shorter than 500\u2009kb, we applied a smaller boundary (80\u2009kb window length, min. 20 SNPs), and detected a 399.9kb long ROH island at position ECA25:6394.110-6794.044 centred round the STX17 gene that was shared by 66.1% of the entire sample (Fig.\u00a04). Across the subpopulations the frequencies for this ROH island was highest in the Austrian sample (71.2%) and lowest in the Croatian sample (51.1%).\n\nFig. 4\nROH island around the STX17 gene (begin and end illustrated by red vertical reference lines) at ECA25:6.394.110\u20136.794.044.

The ROH islands ranged in length between 20.2\u2009kb and 953.3\u2009kb, whereas the longest fragment on ECA11 at 31.01\u201331.94\u2009Mb was shared by the highest number of individuals (72,8%), followed by the ROH island on ECA11 at position 24.13\u201324.81\u2009Mb, which was observed in 61,1% of animals. Within the Austrian sample eight ROH islands on ECA3, ECA5, ECA8, ECA11, ECA14, ECA16, ECA18 and ECA20 were private.Table 4\nROH islands, shared by more than 50% (ROH freq.) of the Lipizzan horses from the Austrian stud farm Piber and the annotated genes in corresponding regions\nWithin the Slovakian sample we detected six ROH islands on ECA11 (3), ECA14, ECA16 and ECA22, whereas the islands on ECA11 and ECA16 overlapped with corresponding islands of the Austrian Lipizzans (Table\u00a05). The ROH islands on ECA22:47.90\u201348.48\u2009Mb and ECA14:34.65\u201335.08\u2009Mb were also identified in the Croatian sample.Table 5\nROH islands, shared by more than 50% (ROH freq.) of the Lipizzan horses from the Slovakian stud farm Topol\u2019\u010dianky and the annotated genes in corresponding regions\nWithin the Croatian sample six ROH islands on ECA4, ECA7, ECA11 (2 islands), ECA14, ECA22, which varied in length between 129.1\u2009kb and 1.14\u2009Mb, were identified.

Four ROH islands on ECA8, ECA22, ECA23 and ECA30 were specific for the Hungarian sample. On ECA8 also a private island of the Austrian sample was documented (Fig.\u00a05).Table 7\nROH islands, shared by more than 50% (ROH freq.) of the Lipizzan horses from the Hungarian stud farms Szilvasv\u00e1rad and the annotated genes in corresponding regions\n\n\nFig. 5\nROH distribution on ECA8 for the entire Lipizzan sample containing one private ROH island for the Hungarian sample (blue line) and one ROH island for the Austrian sample (red line) in the line plot below\nThe total number of ROH (NROH), average length of ROH (LROH) and the sum of all ROH segments (SROH) were summarized according to respective subpopulations.

However, molecular mechanisms regulating rabbit hair growth have remained elusive.Here we aimed to characterise the skin traits and gene expression profiles of short-hair and long-hair rabbits by histological and transcriptome analyses. Haematoxylin-eosin staining was performed to observe the histological structure of the skin of short-hair and long-hair rabbits. Compared to that in short-hair rabbits, a significantly longer anagen phase was observed in long-hair rabbits. In addition, by RNA sequencing, we identified 951 genes that were expressed at significantly different levels in the skin of short-hair and long-hair rabbits. Nine significantly differentially expressed genes were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. A gene ontology analysis revealed that epidermis development, hair follicle development, and lipid metabolic process were significantly enriched. Further, we identified potential functional genes regulating follicle development, lipid metabolic, and apoptosis as well as important pathways including extracellular matrix-receptor interaction and basal cell carcinoma pathway.The present study provides transcriptome evidence for the differences in hair growth between short-hair and long-hair rabbits and reveals that lipid metabolism and apoptosis might constitute major factors contributing to hair length.Rabbits are small mammals providing not only meat, but also hair. Hair is produced from follicles as skin appendages unique to mammals that are characterised by periodic regrowth [1, 2]. Rabbit hair is one of the most favourite natural fibres used in textile industries. The key traits contributing to the economic value of rabbit hairs include fibre diameter, density, and length, which are determined by both genetics and the environment [3\u20136]. The mechanisms regulating hair traits are complicated. Understanding the genetic principles of hair traits could help to elucidate the mechanism of hair development, thus, promoting rabbit breeding.Hair fibre length is a critical economic trait in wool production from Angora rabbits, as it is closely associated with wool quality and yield. In addition, hair length influences textile quality, and also determines the system of manufacture. Different types of hairs in rabbits possess different growth rates, which vary with breed, nutrition, and season [4]. For Angora rabbits in the same environment conditions, gender, body site, and the month age after plucking are closely related to growth rates of rabbit hairs [4]. Hair follicles are the bases of hair growth. An intact hair coat is maintained by lifelong cycling of the hair follicles through periodic stages of growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and relative quiescence (telogen) [2, 7\u20139]. During the anagen phase, hair follicles grow rapidly by cell proliferation and reach their longest length. After regression by apoptosis in the catagen phase, they enter the telogen phase [10, 11]. Apoptosis is a critical event in the regulation of the hair cycle as anagen hairs normally grow for 4\u20137\u2009years in humans before the cycle enters into the resting phases of catagen and telogen [12, 13]. During the process of hair follicles development, Wnt signalling plays a crucial role in hair follicle morphogenesis and regeneration [14, 15]. In addition, some signalling molecules, such as bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), sonic hedgehog (SHH), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, are involved in regulating the time of entry into the anagen phase of the hair follicle cycle [16\u201318]. Hair growth is also regulated by insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) affecting human follicular proliferation, hair growth cycle, and follicular differentiation [19]. FGF5, a member of the FGF family, is the leading candidate for hair length variation, and it is considered a regulator determining the duration of active hair growth (anagen) and the time of hair follicle regression (catagen) [20\u201322]. Recent studies have showed that VEGFR-2 and transcription factor NF-\u03baB are involved in hair cycle regulation and NF-\u03baB is indispensable for hair follicle stem cell activation, maintenance, and/or growth in mice [23, 24].With the rapid development of molecular biological techniques, especially next-generation sequencing, large-scale gene expression detection has become possible. Rabbit genome sequencing has been used to study the polygenic basis of phenotypic variation during rabbit domestication [25] and differential gene expression in parthenogenetic and normal embryos cultured under the same conditions [26]. The landscape of long non-coding RNAs has also been analysed in Trichophyton mentagrophytes-induced dermatophytosis lesional skin and normal skin of rabbit by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) [27]. De novo transcriptome sequencing of Rex rabbit has been performed, and some novel genes have been found to play important roles during skin growth and development [28]. In the present study, to gain a better understanding of the growth rhythm of rabbit hair and molecular mechanisms regulating hair length in rabbits, a histological comparison of hair follicle phenotypes and transcriptome analysis were performed between short-hair and long-hair rabbits. Our results elucidate the molecular mechanism of hair growth and provide valuable information for future studies.In the present study, we detected various splicing events, including alternative 5\u2032 first exon (TSS), alternative 3\u2032 last exon (TTS), alternative exon ends (AE), intron retention (IR), and skipped exon (SKIP) (Additional\u00a0file\u00a07: Figure S6). The number of alternative splicing events and types was similar between the long-hair and short-hair rabbits. The TSS and TTS, which occur when two or more splice sites at 5\u2032 first or 3\u2032 last exon are present, are the most frequently observed events, accounting for approximately 41 and 31% of alternative splicing events in rabbits, respectively. SKIP is the next most common event in AS accounting for approximately 17% of alternative splicing events. IR, whereby an intron is retained in the resulting mature mRNA, is barely detected, accounting for approximately 1.6% of the AS events. These results showed that the number of each AS event was similar between the short-hair and long-hair rabbits.In addition, we compared the sequence data with known reference sequences using the TopHat2 software, and then identified potential SNPs. A total of 726,852 and 852,149 SNPs were detected in long-hair and short-hair rabbits, respectively (Additional\u00a0file\u00a08: Table S2). Compared with that in the long-hair rabbits, more SNPs were identified in short-hair rabbits, demonstrating the differences in SNPs during skin development in short-hair and long-hair rabbits. Approximately 75% SNP sites belonged to the transition type and 25% SNP sites were transversion type. The proportion of heterozygosity SNPs was different in each sample, accounting for 30.90\u201334.98%. Meanwhile, more SNP sites were found in genic regions in each sample. As presented in Additional\u00a0file\u00a09: Figure S7, the proportion of SNPs in the intron region was the highest.Large phenotypic differences exist with respect to hair length between short-hair and long-hair rabbits. The cycle of hair follicles comprises three distinct phases\u2014growth, regression, and resting phases [2, 8, 9]. These stages can be distinguished according to hair follicle morphology. In our previous studies, we reconstructed the follicle cycle of rabbit hair growth by plucking hairs and analysed the hair growth rhythm of short-hair and long-hair rabbits [29, 30]. The results showed a linear upward trend from the fourth to eleventh week in different types of hair from long-hair rabbits, and the hair of short-hair rabbits exhibited rapid growth before the sixth week and remained stable after 6 weeks and suggested different hair growth rates and hair cycles between the two populations. In the present study, we determined the follicle morphology of short-hair and long-hair rabbits at week four, six, and eight after plucking. The results demonstrated that the hair follicles were still in the anagen phase until the eighth week. The regression phase of hair follicle development in long-hair rabbits needs further studies; the hair follicles in short-hair rabbits began to degenerate from the fourth to sixth week and entered the resting phase from the sixth to eighth week. Hair growth is fuelled by bulge stem cells, which are activated at the start of the anagen phase by the dermal papilla [31]. In the present study, long growth phase of hair follicles in long-hair rabbits continuously promoted hair growth. During the catagen phase, hair follicle stem cells in the outer root sheath and the germinal matrix undergo apoptosis, and the lower two-third of hair follicles regress [9]. In the telogen phase, hair follicle stem cells are relatively quiescent, inhibiting hair growth [32]. These findings were consistent with our results, which showed that hair follicles at the sixth week were in the catagen phase and entered the telogen phase when they were at the eighth week after plucking in short-hair rabbits, resulting in the cessation of hair growth.The present study also provides an opportunity to compare the transcriptome of skin tissue between short-hair and long-hair rabbits by high-throughput sequencing to analyse the molecular mechanism associated with differences in hair growth. The transcriptome data obtained are useful to elucidate the different mechanisms of hair growth in the skin of long-hair and short-hair rabbits. It has been reported that >\u200918\u2009M reads from RNA-Seq are required for each sample to attain a saturated state for expression analysis [32, 33]. More than 36\u2009M clean reads were obtained from each sample in the present study, and the quality control assay of our data revealed that the RNA-Seq data were well qualified (Table 1, Additional file 1: Figure S1). The analyses of heatmaps and PCA of DEGs revealed a larger number of significantly DEGs in the skin tissue of short-hair and long-hair rabbits at the sixth week after plucking hairs. These genes might play crucial roles in regulating hair follicle development and hair growth, and their differential expression might be the reason for difference in hair length between short-hair and long-hair rabbits. Ten genes encoding the structural proteins of wool were detected (Table 3). Keratin intermediate filament (KRT-IF) and keratin-associated protein genes encode the majority of wool and hair proteins [34, 35]. The wool follicle-related genes KRT34, KRT38, and KRT39 were expressed only in the cortex, and KRT40 and KRT84 were expressed in the fibre cuticle [34]. Ovine KRT25-KRT28, which encode type I KRTs in the inner root sheath, have also been described [34]. The primary function of KRTs is to protect epithelial cells from apoptosis and mechanical or nonmechanical stresses that can lead to cell death [36, 37]. However, in the present study, a few genes encoding keratin-associated protein were differentially expressed in the two populations. Interestingly, the expression of 10 genes of the KRT family was up-regulated in the skin tissue of long-hair rabbit, suggesting that the KRT genes might contribute to the continuous activity of hair follicle in the long-hair rabbit. We postulated that the 10 KRT genes might also be useful in promoting hair growth. In earlier reports, FGF5 has been identified as an inhibitor of hair growth in various mammals. FGF5 induced regression of the human hair follicle [38] and knock-out and disruption of FGF5 using the CRISPR/Cas9 system in goat resulted in longer fibres [39, 40]. However, there is a recent report on rabbits indicating that FGF5 was also up-regulated in the long wool group (Wan line Angora rabbit) and down-regulated in the short wool group (Chinchilla Rex rabbit and White Rex rabbit) [41], which was consistent with our findings of RNA-seq and q-PCR, showing that the FGF5 gene was up-regulated in the skin of long-hair rabbit. Previous studies also showed that the polypeptide of FGF5s translated from an alternatively spliced variant of FGF5 mRNA suppressed the activity of FGF5, increasing hair growth [42, 43]. We hypothesized that FGF5s of FGF5 mRNA suppressed the activity of FGF5 and promoted hair growth in the rabbit. Further studies are required to investigate the roles of alternatively spliced variants of the FGF5 genes in hair length. In addition, the nine genes were also selected for validation by q-PCR to evaluate our DEG library. All the selected genes showed similar expression patterns between RNA-Seq and q-PCR, demonstrating the reliability of our data. An additional expression analyses of the selected genes showed that their expression profiles at the eighth week after plucking were similar to those at the sixth week. The hair follicles of short-hair and long-hair rabbits at the eighth week were in the telogen and the anagen phase, respectively. The finding further demonstrated that the genes played important roles in regulating hair follicle development and hair growth.The GO analysis showed that a large proportion of DEGs were significantly enriched in the biological processes such as epidermis development, epithelial cell differentiation, hair follicle development, and lipid metabolism process. The results demonstrated that the DEGs are potential regulators of hair follicle development and lipid metabolism in rabbits.In addition, a number of DEGs were also found to be significantly enriched in extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction and basal cell carcinoma pathway. The extracellular matrix in the ECM-receptor interaction is a complex mixture of structural and functional macromolecules, including fibrous proteins (collagen, fibronectin, and laminin) [44, 45]. Different collagens form different ECM components, for example, collagens 1, 3, and 5 form the fibrils, collagen 6 forms the microfibril, and collagen 4 forms the basal membrane [46]. The amount of ECM per cell contributes to the volume of the dermal papilla [47]. The previous study showed that many of the ECM-related genes, including collagen, laminin, and fibronectin were differentially expressed between primary and secondary hair follicle dermal papilla cells, resulting in an enlarged dermal papilla [48]. Dermal papillas control the number of matrix cells and, thus, the character and size of the hair follicle and its shaft [49]. In the present study, the differential expression of COL1\u03b12, COL3\u03b11, COL5\u03b12, and COL5\u03b13 suggested a relation to the size difference of the hair follicle and its shaft between the two populations and the PCA further showed that COL1\u03b12 and COL3\u03b11 were important regulators of hair follicle development. The differential expression of other ECM-related genes, such as ITGB3, LAMA4, LAMC3, VWF, and TNXB, also shows the difference in the ECM structure between short-hair and long-hair rabbits. The results of the present study also showed that the expression of GLI1, SHH, and PTCH1 involved in the basal cell carcinoma pathway was up-regulated in short-hair rabbits. It has been reported that the inhibition of GLI1 induces cell-cycle arrest and enhances apoptosis in brain glioma cell lines [50]. SHH and PTCH1 are also key components of the Hedgehog pathway, which primarily regulates the genes involved in cell growth, proliferation, survival, and apoptosis [51]. Hair follicle genes were also found to be involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and growth in Hu sheep lambskin [52]. Therefore, the differential expression of GLI1, SHH, and PTCH1 suggests the difference in hair follicle cycle and apoptosis in the two populations, and their roles in the regulation of hair follicle cycle and apoptosis in rabbits. WNT signals are required for the initiation of hair follicle development [14]. It has also been reported that LEF-1 is involved in controlling the development of whisker follicles [53], and WNT5a inhibits the growth of hair follicles in mice [54]. It has been reported that Wnt, Shh, TGF-b and Notch signalling pathways may be involved in hair follicle development and cycling in cashmere goats [55]. The results of the present study showed that LEF-1, WNT5a, and TCF7 involved in the WNT signalling pathway were significantly up-regulated in long-hair rabbits. Further, the Notch signalling pathway regulates hair cell differentiation in the cochlea of mammals [56] and mediates hair cell regeneration partially depending on Wnt signalling [57]. In the present study, we found the upregulation of BAMBI and SMAD7 in the TGF-\u03b2 signalling pathway in long-hair rabbits; they are the key regulators of hair cycle [7]. Overall, the candidate genes identified in the present study might therefore serve as potential regulators of hair length in rabbits.Alternative splicing and SNPs can increase protein complexity and cause diversity in biological traits. Alternative splicing is one of the major mechanisms contributing to protein diversity [58]. Although AS is widespread in eukaryotes, we tend to underestimate its proportion. The changes in AS might therefore represent a major source of species-specific differences [59\u201361]. In this study, we detected five primary alternatively spliced events and analysed the number of each AS event (Additional file 7: Figure S6). The results showed that the number of TSS and TTS events was the highest and the IR event was the least in rabbits. Most genomic variations are attributable to the SNPs, and therefore, offer the highest resolution to track disease-related genes and population history [62, 63]. A total of 231,653\u2013317,941 SNPs were found to specifically match the genome of Oryctolagus cuniculus in six rabbit samples. Compared with the intergenic SNPs, more SNPs were found in genic regions where most SNPs are located in the intron regions. The SNPs in or near genes explain more variations than the SNPs between genes for complex traits [64, 65]. These results imply that the diversity in regulation of complex traits, which can be by either genic regions or nearby gene regions, and even by intergenic region. The specific roles of AS and SNPs in regulating hair length of short-hair and long-hair rabbits need further study.In conclusion, we identified differences in the histology and transcriptome profile of skin between short-hair and long-hair rabbit. The histological analysis showed different hair cycles and growth rate between the two populations. The differences in the transcriptome profile of the two populations were consistent with the differences observed in morphological traits. RNA-Seq enabled us to obtain candidate genes involved in hair follicle development, lipid metabolism, and apoptosis. The expression of differentially expressed lipid metabolic and apoptotic genes in the skin of rabbits can be used as a novel trait with the potential to alter hair length. Further studies are required to investigate the roles of candidate genes in hair length to improve rabbit breeding programmes.Rabbits were given anesthesia through an ear vein injection of 0.7% pentobarbital sodium (6\u2009ml/kg) before sampling. Skin tissue samples (1\u2009cm2) from the back of each rabbit were collected at week four, six and eight after plucking hairs for histological analysis. The skin samples were fixed with 4% formaldehyde (40% formaldehyde solution and distilled water mixed at a 1:9 ratio) solution. Cross sections of the fixed samples were washed with running water, dehydrated using an ethyl alcohol series, cleaned in xylene, and embedded in paraffin wax. The specimens were sectioned to a thickness of 4\u2009\u03bcm using a Leica RM2235 microtome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Transverse and vertical cross-sections of the fixed and paraffin-embedded samples were stained with HE, examined and photographed using an Olympus BX51 biomicroscope (Olympus Optical Company, Tokyo, Japan).Under anesthesia, skin samples from the back were collected at the sixth week after plucking the hair, when the wool cycle of long-hair rabbit is expected to be in the anagen phase and that of short-hair rabbit is expected to be in catagen phase, frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately, and stored at \u2212\u200980\u2009\u00b0C prior to RNA extraction. The total RNA was extracted from the skin samples of long-hair rabbits (designated as L1, L2, and L3) and short-hair rabbits (designated as S1, S2, and S3) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The samples were sent to the Beijing Biomarker Technologies Company. The quality of RNA was evaluated using the RNA integrity number value using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The mRNA was purified, fragmented, and converted to cDNA, adapters were ligated to the end of double-stranded cDNA, and libraries were created by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to manufacturer\u2019s protocols. The libraries constructed were quantified with Qubit2.0 and the insert size library was determined using Agilent 2100. Six independent paired-end libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) system according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Above 10.50 Gb clean reads per sample were generated for the genome-wide transcriptomic analyses.The trimmed reads were assembled and mapped to the reference genome (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/?term=Rabbit) by performing alignments using the TopHat2 [68] software. The AS and SNPs were analysed using the Cufflinks [69] and GATK [70] software, respectively.The values of fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped (FPKM) [71] were generated and used to identify the expression level of genes in each rabbit sample. Differential expression analysis was performed with DESeq, an R package [72]. The P-value corresponds to a differential gene expression test in which the false discovery rate (FDR) was used to determine the threshold of P-value in multiple tests. We filtered the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with the standards (Fold Change \u22652 and FDR\u2009<\u20090.01). The gene ontology (GO) analysis was employed to analyse the functions of the DEGs. All the DEGs were mapped to the GO terms in the database (http://www.geneontology.org/). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database was used to perform pathway enrichment analysis of the DEGs. Cluster 3.0 [73] was used for the clustering analysis.To verify the RNA-Seq results, a set of six candidate genes were selected from the list of DEGs and the relative expression level of each gene was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR). The PCRs were performed for each individual using 1.0\u2009\u03bcg of residual RNA from the original extraction described above. The first-strand cDNA was synthesised using EasyScript One-Step gDNA Removal and cDNA Synthesis SuperMix (Transgen, Beijing, China). The q-PCR was carried out in a LightCycler 96 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) using TransStart Green qPCR SuperMix (Transgen, Beijing, China). The following conditions were used for amplification: 94\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s, followed by 40\u2009cycles of 94\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009s, 62\u2009\u00b0C for 35\u2009s, and a melt curve stage of 97\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009s, 65\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009min, and 97\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009s. The primers for the q-PCR are listed in Additional\u00a0file\u00a011: Table S3. The GAPDH gene was used as a constitutive expression control in these experiments. The relative expression level of each gene was estimated by the 2-\u0394\u0394CT method [74]. The q-PCR analysis was performed in triplicates for each sample.Excel 2010 (Microsoft) was used to analyse the data. The data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD). Student\u2019s t-test was used for statistical comparisons. The results with a P value <\u20090.05 were considered to be statistically significant.Alternative splicingDifferentially expressed genesExtracellular matrixFalse discovery rateFragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mappedGene ontologyHaematoxylin-eosinKyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and GenomesKeratinPrincipal component analysisQuantitative real-time PCRRNA sequencingStandard deviationSingle nucleotide polymorphismsThis work was supported by the earmarked fund for Modern Agro-industry Technology Research System from the Ministry of Agriculture of P.R.

Compared with that at the fourth week, no obvious changes were observed in long-hair rabbits at the sixth week (Fig. 1c, i). However, the hair follicles of short-hair rabbits appeared shrunk at the sixth week (Fig. 1d), and the area of primary and secondary hair follicles and thickness of inner root sheaths obviously decreased when compared with those at the fourth week (Fig. 1d, j). The hair follicle structure remained intact at the eighth week in long-hair rabbits (Fig. 1e, k), whereas, the hair follicles of short-hair rabbits significantly shrunk and finger-like papillae atrophied up to the arrectores pilorum, which indicated that the hair follicles of short-hair rabbits at the eighth week had entered the telogen phase, resulting in the cessation of hair growth (Fig. 1f, l). However, the hair follicles of long-hair rabbits were still in the anagen phase until at the eighth week, leading to continuous growth of hair.\n\nFig. 1\nThe histological observation of skin tissue after plucking out hairs from long-hair and short-hair rabbits. a Transverse section of long-hair at the fourth week. b Transverse section of short-hair rabbit at the fourth week. c Transverse section of long-hair at the sixth week. d Transverse section of short-hair rabbit at the sixth week. e Transverse section of long-hair at the eighth week. f Transverse section of short-hair rabbit at the eighth week. g Longitudinal section of long-hair at the fourth week. h Longitudinal section of short-hair rabbit at the fourth week. i Longitudinal section of long-hair at the sixth week. j Longitudinal section of short-hair rabbit at the sixth week. k Longitudinal section of long-hair at the eighth week. l Longitudinal section of short-hair rabbit at the eighth week.

After removing low-quality reads and adaptor sequences, more than 36\u2009M clean reads were obtained from each sample, and Q30 was \u226591.74% (Table\u00a01; Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figure S1). The map rates of unique reads from the sequenced skin RNA of long-hair and short-hair rabbits were\u2009>\u200960.45% (Table\u00a02). After the standard analysis, 16,931 genes were detected from the six samples. Interestingly, the number of genes found among all the samples was similar with respect to the FPKM value (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Figure S2). The largest proportion of genes exhibited low (0\u2009<\u2009FPKM <\u200910) and moderate (10\u2009<\u2009FPKM <\u2009100) expression, and a small fraction of the genes were expressed at high levels (FPKM >\u2009100), further confirming the advantage of detecting low-abundance genes by high-throughput sequencing. In addition, 951 DEGs (FDR\u2009<\u20090.01, |log2Ratio|\u2009\u2265\u20091) were filtered between the groups comprising 539 genes expressed highly in the skin of long-hair rabbits and 412 genes expressed highly in the skin of short-hair rabbits (Fig.\u00a02a; Additional\u00a0file\u00a03: Figure S3). A number of genes that were identified as being more highly expressed in long-hair rabbits were from the keratin (KRT) families, including the 10 genes (KRT23, KRT25, KRT26, KRT28, KRT34, KRT38, KRT39, KRT40, KRT7, and KRT84) (Table\u00a03), which suggested that the 10 genes are important candidates regulating hair length in rabbits. In addition, a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on DEGs, which showed that the short-hair and long-hair rabbits were clearly differentiated in the direction of the component 1 (Fig. 2b). Moreover, PCA identified several genes functioning in hair growth regulation, such as KRT25, S100A3, COL3\u03b11, COL1\u03b12, LOC100340949, LOC100338342, LOC100359226 (Fig. 2c).Table 1\nSummary of RNA-seq data for each sample\nTable 2\nMapping statistics for each sample\n\nClean reads are single-end Reads\n\n\nFig. 2\nA heatmap and Principal Component Analysis of the DEGs between short-hair and long-hair rabbit. a Cluster analysis of DEGs.

The keratin filament (GO:0045095) and intermediate filament (GO:0005882) in the cellular component category were enriched by KRT7 and KRT34, respectively. The epithelial cell differentiation (GO:0030855) in the biological process category was enriched by KRT40\nTo evaluate our DEG library, the relative expression levels of five DEGs from the KRT family (KRT25, KRT28, KRT39, KRT40, and KRT84) as well as FGF5 and ECM-related genes (COL3\u03b11, TNXB, and VWF) were analysed by q-PCR. As shown in Fig.\u00a03 and Additional\u00a0file\u00a04: Figure S4, the results of RNA-Seq and q-PCR were similar. In general, the results of q-PCR validated the RNA-Seq results and demonstrated the reliability of our data. Furthermore, we also found that the expression profiles of the selected genes at the eighth week after plucking (Additional\u00a0file\u00a05: Figure S5) were similar to those at the sixth week.\n\nFig. 3\nA q-PCR analysis of nine DEGs in the skin of short-hair and long-hair rabbits. a KRT25 b KRT28 c KRT39 d KRT40 e KRT84 f FGF5 g COL3\u03b11 h TNXB i VWF.

Bars represent the standard error. ** P\u2009<\u20090.01, * P\u2009<\u20090.05\nGene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were used for the functional analysis and signalling pathway annotations of these DEGs. The GO terms with the Q value \u22640.05 were considered to be significantly enriched. Several GO terms related to hair follicle development and lipid metabolism in the biological process category were found (Fig.\u00a04, Additional\u00a0file\u00a06: Table S1). A comparison between short-hair and long-hair rabbits showed some DEGs involved in the biological processes including epidermis development (9 genes, Q\u2009=\u20090.00427), molting cycle (4 genes, Q\u2009=\u20090.01352), hair cycle (4 genes, Q\u2009=\u20090.01352), lipid biosynthetic process (8 genes, Q\u2009=\u20090.01829), hair follicle development (4 genes, Q\u2009=\u20090.02563), and so on (Additional file 6: Table S1). The GO analysis demonstrated large differences in hair follicle development and lipid metabolism between short-hair and long-hair rabbits. In addition, six important pathways related to the regulation of hair follicle development were identified (Table\u00a04). Among them, the extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction and basal cell carcinoma pathway were significantly enriched between short-hair and long-hair rabbits (P\u00a0<\u20090.05). Therefore, we focused on these two pathways for further characterisation. The DEGs enriched in the both pathways are listed in Table 4. In the ECM-receptor interaction, the expression of 15 DEGs, including the collagen genes (such as COL1A2, COL3A1, COL5A2, and COL5A3), laminin genes (such as LAMA4 and LAMC3), integrin genes (such as ITGB3 and LOC103346304), and tenascin genes (such as TNN and TNXB) was down-regulated in long-hair rabbits (Table 4). In the basal cell carcinoma pathway, 11 up-regulated genes, including GLI1, PTCH1, and SHH, were identified (Table\u00a04).\n\nFig. 4\nThe significantly enriched GO terms of DEGs between short-hair and long-hair rabbits (P\u2009<\u20090.05).

The x-axis represents the number of DEGs enriched in biological processes; y-axis represents the GO terms enriched by DEGs\nTable 4\nThe DEGs enriched in the pathways related to skin development between short-hair and long-hair rabbits\nAll rabbits were procured from the rabbit farm in the Animal Husbandry Institute of Anhui Academy of Agriculture Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, China. The rabbits were raised and managed under the same condition, feeding to appetite; drinking water was supplied via an automatic drinking bowl. A cross between the Wan Strain Angora rabbit and Rex rabbit was carried out to produce the F1 generation (Fig.\u00a05). The F1 generation was then backcrossed (BC) with the Wan Strain Angora rabbit, which produced F2 rabbits. Two phenotypic traits segregated in the families; two hair length characters (586 short-hair and 613 long-hair rabbits). The segregation ratio of hair length in F2 generation was consistent with Mendel heredity principles (1:1, \u03c72\u2009=\u20090.564, P\u2009=\u20090.436). Normal rabbit fur is composed of three different types of hairs including coarse hairs, awn hairs, and fine hairs [66, 67]; the length of the different hair types was measured at the tenth week after plucking (Additional\u00a0file\u00a010: Figure S8). Finally, three female short-hair and long-hair rabbits were selected for the present study, respectively.\n\nFig. 5\nHair length trait segregation in the family.

(PDF 95 kb)", "s12864-019-5444-4": "Land plant organellar genomes have significant impact on metabolism and adaptation, and as such, accurate assembly and annotation of plant organellar genomes is an important tool in understanding the evolutionary history and interactions between these genomes. Intracellular DNA transfer is ongoing between the nuclear and organellar genomes, and can lead to significant genomic variation between, and within, species that impacts downstream analysis of genomes and transcriptomes.In order to facilitate further studies of cytonuclear interactions in Eucalyptus, we report an updated annotation of the E. grandis plastid genome, and the second sequenced and annotated mitochondrial genome of the Myrtales, that of E. grandis. The 478,813\u2009bp mitochondrial genome shows the conserved protein coding regions and gene order rearrangements typical of land plants. There have been widespread insertions of organellar DNA into the E. grandis nuclear genome, which span 141 annotated nuclear genes. Further, we identify predicted editing sites to allow for the discrimination of RNA-sequencing reads between nuclear and organellar gene copies, finding that nuclear copies of organellar genes are not expressed in E. grandis.The implications of organellar DNA transfer to the nucleus are often ignored, despite the insight they can give into the ongoing evolution of plant genomes, and the problems they can cause in many applications of genomics. Future comparisons of the transcription and regulation of organellar genes between Eucalyptus genotypes may provide insight to the cytonuclear interactions that impact economically important traits in this widely grown lignocellulosic crop species.Plastid and mitochondrial genomes are well studied aspects of land plant genomics, with 2484 plastid (1987 \u201cchloroplast\u201d, 506 \u201cplastid\u201d), and 167 mitochondrial genomes on NCBI for land plants as of June 2018, compared to the 141 nuclear genomes completed at the chromosome level [1]. A consequence of the endosymbiotic integration of plastids and mitochondria into plant cells is that the coding potential of their genomes is severely diminished compared to their ancestral genomes [2, 3]. The majority of organellar proteomes are encoded by the nuclear genome of plants, with \u00b197% of plastid, and\u2009\u00b1\u200999% of mitochondrial targeted proteins encoded by the nucleus [4]. Retained protein-coding organellar genes are essential to the metabolic functions of plastids and mitochondria, and variation in organellar genomes impact fitness and metabolism in angiosperms [5\u20139].In plants, intracellular DNA transfer results in nuclear plastidial DNAs (NUPTs) and nuclear mitochondrial DNAs (NUMTs), that are still present in the organellar genomes [4]. Phylogenetic analysis of Arabidopsis and rice organellar DNA insertions show that large, primary insertions of organellar DNA into the nuclear genomes of plants occur, and these insertions decay over time [10]. The rate and distribution of organellar inserts into the nuclear genome vary between plant species, as do the location and proximity to transposable elements, which rearrange and expand inserted regions [10]. These recent inter-genomic DNA transfers between the nuclear and organellar genomes can result in multiple copies of organellar genes in the nuclear genome, presenting interesting avenues of research into the evolutionary history of plants and the process of endosymbiosis, as ongoing gene transfer may lead to the loss of the organellar encoded copy [11].Key requirements to understanding the impact of organellar genome variation and transcript expression are high-quality annotated genomes, and a catalogue of intracellular genome transfers in order to distinguish between RNA originating from the organellar and nuclear genomes. Since it was sequenced in 2014, the Eucalyptus genome has become an important, and highly utilized genome for a variety of biological, ecological, and biotechnological studies [12]. Here, we update the assembly and annotation of the E. grandis plastid genome (adding 14 genes) and assemble and annotate the mitochondrial genome of E. grandis. We identified recent organellar genome transfers, and potential editing sites that can be used to distinguish transcripts originating from the organellar and nuclear genomes.Recently, the first mitochondrial genome of the order Myrtales was released, that of Lagerstroemia indica (NC_035616.1). Compared to the E. grandis mitochondrial genome, the 333,948\u2009bp long mitochondrial genome of L. indica is smaller, with a higher GC content at 46% compared to 44% in E. grandis. Of the annotated L. indica mitochondrial genes, one has been lost in E. grandis (rps19), while two are not present in L. indica (sdh3 and rps13). As is typical of land plant mitochondrial genomes [18], there has been massive re-arrangement of gene order between the two Myrtales families, with the largest block of collinear genes being sdh4-cox3-atp8 (Additional\u00a0file\u00a05: Figure S2). Further, rpl16 has gained an intron in L. indica, which is not present in E. grandis. Given the diverse nature of the Myrtales [19], and the frequent rearrangements and gene losses present in mitochondrial genomes [20] (Additional\u00a0file\u00a06: Figure S3), the differences between the two families are expected, and can be used in further phylogenetic analyses.The E. grandis plastid genome consists of 3.05% short repeat elements, the most abundant being simple and low complexity repeats (Table 1, Additional file 1: Table S1) The genome contains 90 genes, which includes six pseudogenes, for a total of 84 protein coding genes (Fig. 2a, Table 1). There are 37 annotated tRNA genes, representing 20 unique tRNAs. Introns are present in 8 of the annotated tRNA genes, namely tRNA-Lys, tRNA-Gly, tRNA-Leu, tRNA-Val, tRNA-Ile (2 copies), and tRNA-Ala (2 copies). The 8 rRNA genes in the plastid genome are found in the repeat regions, for a total of 4 unique rRNA genes. The intron structure of the plastid protein coding genes is highly conserved, with 11 genes containing at least two introns, of these, ndhB and rpl12 are present as duplicates in the IR region. Three of the intron containing genes contain three exons; ycf3, clpP, and rps12. Two exons of rps12 are present in the IR regions, and are trans-spliced to exon 1 found in the LSC region, as is common in land plants [24, 25]. The only difference in the coding regions of the previously published Eucalyptus plastid genomes (excluding the 2011 E. grandis plastid genome) is the annotation of psbL, which is annotated as a pseudogene, but has a predicted C to U editing site that creates a start codon (Additional\u00a0file\u00a07 - Sheet 2). The creation of a canonical start codon via C to U editing in the psbL gene has been well documented in other land plants [26, 27]. Thus, we include psbL as a bona fide gene in E. grandis plastid genome annotation.Land plant plastid and mitochondrial encoded transcripts are known to undergo extensive post-transcriptional C to U editing, which generally results in non-synonymous amino acid changes, and can create and abolish start and stop codons [28]. In order to identify potential transcript editing sites in the E. grandis plastid and mitochondrial genomes, we predicted editing events using two homology based predictive approaches, PREPACT and PREP-suite [29, 30]. In the E. grandis mitochondrial genome, we identified 505 and 470 predicted C to U editing sites for an average of ~\u200913 and ~\u200912 editing sites per gene with PREPACT and PREP-mt respectively (Table 1, Additional\u00a0file\u00a08: Figure S4a, Additional file 7 - Sheet 1). Three of the predicted edits create canonical AUG translational start sites in mitochondrial nad1A, nad4L, and rps10, which have been reported in other plant species [31\u201333]. Interestingly, mitochondrial rpl16 is annotated as a pseudogene due to an internal stop codon (TAG). In other plant species, this codon position is encoded as CAG and is post-transcriptionally edited to a stop codon (TAG), leading to a downstream non-canonical start codon (GTG) being used instead [32, 34]. This GTG is conserved in the mitochondrial genome of E. grandis, and it may be possible that rpl16 is not a pseudogene and is translated from the GTG codon.Plastid protein coding gene transcripts are also post-transcriptionally edited by C to U, although the frequency of editing sites in plastid genomes are drastically lower in land plant plastids compared to mitochondria [35]. In the plastid genome of E. grandis, we report 49 predicted C to U editing sites as predicted by PREPACT, using Arabidopsis thaliana as reference protein databases, and 53 using PREP-cp (Table 1, Additional file 8: Figure S4b, Additional file 7 - Sheet 2) [29]. These editing sites exclude sites duplicated in the inverted repeat regions, keeping only the sites found in IRA, as it includes the full length of ycf1. These results are standard for the highly conserved plastid genomes of land plants [36, 37].We found evidence of editing sites in the organellar genomes of E. grandis with 24 bulked polyA-selected, paired end transcriptome datasets from eight E. grandis tissues (Additional file 8: Figure S4a and b). Using REDItools to discriminate between potential variants at the DNA level and true RNA editing sites, we could confirm 377 of the predicted mitochondrial editing sites, and 32 of the predicted plastid editing sites (Additional file 8: Figure S4 c and d, Additional file 7) [38]. These include the predicted start codons of psbL, nad4L, and rps10. REDItools identified 52 mitochondrial and 6 plastid edits not predicted by either PREPACT or PREP-suite, (Additional file 8: Figure S4c and d), which may be bona fide editing sites, or may be due the relatively low cut-offs defined in the analysis (total coverage >\u200910 reads, at least 3 reads supporting the edit). Further, REDItools identified synonymous editing sites in codon position 1 of plastid and mitochondrial genes, 1 of which is found in the plastid genome, and 6 in the mitochondrial genome (Additional file 7). Due to the fact that the transcriptome data was prepared from polyA selected RNA, the editing sites identified should be confirmed using total RNA sequencing, as polyadenylated transcripts in organelles are destined for degradation, and do not accurately reflect organellar transcriptomes [39, 40].Transferred DNA between the nuclear and organellar genomes of land plants creates the potential for complete transcript transfer that could be expressed from the nuclear genome [4]. In order to identify full length organellar transcripts in the nuclear genome of E. grandis, we used BLAST to align predicted organellar genes to E. grandis nuclear genes (>\u200980% of nuclear or organellar transcript length), and the annotation of the E. grandis v2.0 genome (Fig. 3, Additional\u00a0file\u00a012). We find 101 nuclear genes that have been transferred from the plastid genome (32 annotated as A. thaliana chloroplast genes, and 69 from the BLAST analysis). Further, there are 40 nuclear genes of mitochondrial origin (1 annotated as A. thaliana mitochondrial gene and 39 from the BLAST analysis). When genes without annotations in this group are examined for potential homologs in other plant species using the PLAZA database [41], we find that most of these nuclear genes are in fact orphan genes, with no homologs in the nuclear or organellar genomes of other dicot plant species. There are two exceptions, Eucgr.J01097 and Eucgr.J02736, which are members of conserved gene families in plants. The first of these, Eucgr.J01097, is a homolog of a mitovirus RNA dependant polymerase [42], which occurs in the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of 12 other dicot plant species (PLAZA family HOM03D004415) [34]. Eucgr.J02736 forms part of a gene family that is present in six dicot plant species (PLAZA family HOM03006657) [41]. This gene is likely of plastid origin, as it is also found in the plastid transferred gene set (Additional\u00a0file\u00a012). Mismatches and indels present in the nuclear copies of full length organellar genes will allow for the identification of mRNA-seq reads mapped to the genome that they are expressed from (Additional\u00a0file\u00a012).Of all the identified genes that are potentially transferred from the organellar genome to the nuclear genome, only one does not have decreased read counts when the polyA mRNA data is aligned to all three E. grandis genomes. This gene, Eucgr.E01203, was identified as a transferred gene due to its annotation as an A. thaliana chloroplast NADH-Ubiquinone/plastoquinone (complex I) protein gene (ndhB2). The parameters used in the BLAST analysis above did not identify this gene as an organellar transferred gene, as the CDS of this gene is truncated compared to the organellar ndhB2 gene (Eucgr.P00068), with a length of 228 versus 1533\u2009nt. Read coverage across this gene in mature leaf tissue shows that the aligned reads do not span the annotated CDS, rather, they are found in the 5\u2019 UTR (Additional\u00a0file\u00a013: Figure S5). The variance stabilizing transformation (VST) counts of Eucgr.E01203 are thus unlikely to represent functional gene expression.Organellar encoded genes show that the polyA-selected mRNA reads aligned differentially across tissues in E. grandis. In general, the plastid and mitochondrial genes have low numbers of reads aligning across all tissues, with some genes having high numbers of reads aligning in leaf and flower tissues (Fig. 4c). Compared to the all nuclear encoded genes, we identified 28 organellar genes with significant polyA-selected read abundance variation between immature xylem and mature leaf tissues (Additional\u00a0file\u00a014: Table S4). All 28 of these organellar encoded genes have decreased polyadenylated transcripts in immature xylem as compared to mature leaf. Of these, only one is a mitochondrial encoded gene, Eucgr.M00039 (maturase R). The plastid differentially polyadenylated genes are predominantly photosystem genes (psaA, B, and J, and psbA, B, C, D, E, H, I, J, K, L, and T). The tissue specific nature of the read abundance variation in the photosystem genes specifically shows that these reads are not an artefact of transcripts \u201cescaping\u201d polyA selection based their GC content [46]. Further, we conclude that plastid encoded photosystem genes are differentially polyadenylated between tissues in E. grandis, and that organellar encoded genes are either not significantly polyadenylated or are lowly expressed in xylem.Organellar genomes are an important resource for many genomic and biotechnological applications [47], and as such, we aimed to provide a resource of high-quality sequences and annotations for the mitochondrial and plastid genomes of Eucalyptus grandis. The genus Eucalyptus consists of more than 700 species and their hybrids, many of which are economically and ecologically important [48, 49]. Additionally, E. grandis is an emerging model species for the study of xylogenesis [50]. The mitochondrial genome of E. grandis the second for the order Myrtales and should facilitate further studies in the phylogeny of this order [51, 52]. The size of the E. grandis mitochondrial genome, GC content, number of coding genes, and predicted RNA editing sites is well within the range of sequenced land plant mitochondrial genomes [53]. The mitochondrial genome of E. grandis shares many features with other published land plant mitochondrial genomes, specifically the loss of rps and rpl subunits [54]. The genome structure of the mitochondrial genome is potentially linear, or present as sub-genomic circles due to the presence of large repeat regions [20, 55]. We could identify one repeat mediated structural variant from the aligned paired-end reads, although any of the repeat regions could be involved in alternate conformations of the mitochondrial genome. As we could not confidently detect any other possible structural variants, mitochondrial DNA isolation from meristematic tissues or ovules [13, 55], and long-read sequencing methods may improve the assembly in future [56].Organellar DNA is surprisingly mobile, and DNA transfers between organellar and nuclear genomes, and between species occur frequently [4], predominantly from the plastid and mitochondria to the nucleus [10], and from the nucleus and plastid to the mitochondria [9]. In many commercially important biomass crop species, large amounts of organellar DNA has been transferred to the nuclear genome. In Populus trichocarpa and Gossypium raimondii, near complete chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes respectively have been transferred to the nuclear genome [15, 57]. In E. grandis, we identified DNA transfers from the organelles to the nucleus, and from the plastid to the mitochondria (Fig. 3, Additional file 1: Table S1). Nuclear genes that align to the organellar genomes are gene fragments that have been annotated as complete genes due to the evidence of gene expression resulting from polyadenylated organellar transcripts. Using next-generation RNA-sequencing, we were able to show that the NUMT and NUPT genes, and nuclear genes which align to the organellar genomes are not functionally expressed from the nuclear genome of E. grandis (Fig. 4). Utilizing a method of SNP aware alignment, using predicted editing sites as SNPs, we show that reads in transferred regions preferentially align to the organellar genomes (Fig. 4). Further analysis showed that feature counts, especially when they are extremely low, do not accurately reflect transcript expression, but rather fragmented alignment of a few reads across the transcript (Additional\u00a0file\u00a013: Figure S5). This analysis allows for the confident alignment of mRNA reads to the three genomes of E. grandis for the quantification of organellar transcripts in future experiments.The analysis of polyA-selected mRNA sequencing read alignment to the organellar genomes has value beyond identifying expressed NUMT and NUPT genes, as organellar genes are polyadenylated as a degradation signal [40, 58, 59]. We find that between mature leaf and immature xylem, the vast majority of differentially polyadenylated genes are photosystem genes from the chloroplast genome (Additional\u00a0file\u00a014: Table S4). Photosystem genes are either not expressed, or very lowly expressed in non-photosynthetic tissues such as xylem [60, 61]. Given RNA turnover requirements, and imprecise transcriptional termination, the highly expressed photosystem genes in chloroplasts may lead to the polyadenylation of those transcripts in mature leaf [40]. Additionally, mature leaf chloroplast transcriptomes are differentially regulated compared to those in young leaf [62], and transcript degradation may play a role in this process.This work provides a platform for further investigation into the myrtaceae by providing a reference genome and annotations for the mitochondria of E. grandis. The organellar genomes can be used in the future to study the transcription of organellar genes, and the tissue specific mechanism of transcriptional regulation by polyadenylation [5, 7]. Further, the co-evolution of nuclear and organellar genomes have been shown to affect hybrid vigour and speciation [63\u201366], and this work will allow for such studies in Eucalyptus, genera in which hybrids are ecologically and industrially important.Paired end, whole genome sequencing reads of a three-year-old E. grandis genotype TAG0014 from mature leaf tissue was used in the assembly of the E. grandis mitochondrial and plastid genomes (SRP132546). The reads were sequenced by the Beijing Genomics Institute using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Contigs of mitochondrial origin, identified from the nuclear genome assembly project [12], were used as seed sequences for assembly using MITObim v1.6 using the -- quick flag, and kmer length of 41 [67]. The mitochondrial genome was assessed for circularity using the circules.py script available as a part of MITObim (https://github.com/chrishah/MITObim). SVDetect was used to determine if the WGS reads aligned to the mitochondrial genome assembly using Bowtie 2 showed evidence of alternative genome configurations [14, 68]. As they are mediated by large repeat regions, alternate configurations of the genome can be identified from discordant read pairs that mapped in the wrong orientation, or at a distance larger or smaller than half the insert size (<\u2009250\u2009bp, >\u2009750\u2009bp), which were identified using SAMtools v1.3.1 view flag \u2018-F 1294\u2019 [14, 69]. To avoid regions which may be artifacts of plastid and nuclear DNA transfer, we further removed all reads which were not uniquely mapped to the mitochondrial genome. The identified SVDetect breakpoints within 250\u2009bp of a mitochondrial repeat region were identified using bedtools v2.27.1 closest [70].The mitochondrial genome was manually annotated using a combination of homology-based predictions, namely Mitofy [71], MFannot [72], and Geneious v10.0.5 [73]. Similarly, the plastid genome was assembled using NOVOPlasty v1.1 with kmer length of 39 [74], with the previous E. grandis plastid genome as seed sequence (NC_014570.1). The plastid genome was manually annotated using DOGMA [75], CpGAVAS [76], Geneious v10.0.5 [73], and MFannot [72].Transcript editing sites were identified using the PREPACT web server and PREP-suite (Mt and Cp) for both genomes [29, 30]. For PREPACT analysis of the mitochondrial genome, Arabidopsis thaliana, Nicotiana tabacum, and Vitis vinifera was used to identify conserved C to U edits using BLASTx prediction, with stop codons edited if possible and all other parameters kept at default. A predicted editing site was classified as being predicted by PREPACT if it occurred in at least two of the species used for prediction. For the PREPACT plastid genome editing site prediction, Arabidopsis thaliana was used as reference protein database for BLASTx prediction, with all other parameters kept at default. For PREP-suite analysis of the plastid and mitochondrial genomes, a prediction confidence cut-off of 0.5 was used to predict editing sites, with all other parameters at default. Low-complexity repeats were identified in both genomes using RepeatMasker [77], with reference set to Arabidopsis thaliana, and all other parameters as default. Large genomic repeats were identified with Unipro UGENE [78], with repeat identity set to >\u200995%, and repeat length\u2009>\u2009100\u2009nt. Both genomes were visualized with OrganellarGenomeDRAW [79], and WGS reads were aligned using Bowtie 2 [68] to visualize coverage using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV [80]).BLAST (BLAST 2.3.0+) hits of >\u2009100\u2009bp, e-value >\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2212\u20095, and 75% identity were used in the analysis of NUPTs and NUMTs, and inter-organellar genome transfer [81]. Regions originating from the IR regions of the plastid genome were counted once, unless they spanned the SC flanking regions. Inter-organellar DNA transfers were assigned an organelle of origin using a custom BLAST database of all land plant organelles retrieved from GenBank in June 2017 [51]. Results of the DNA transfer analysis outlined above were visualized using Circos v0.69 [82] with transferred regions >\u2009500\u2009bp shown for clarity. In order to identify transferred protein coding genes between the nuclear and organellar genomes, BLAST analysis of full-length transcripts from the organellar genomes to the complete nuclear genome and vice versa was done. Transcripts are considered complete transfers if they covered >\u200980% of the transcript length in either the nuclear or organellar gene and had >\u200975% identity between transcripts. Nuclear genes that are annotated as organellar genes were identified based on their closest A. thaliana homolog from the E. grandis v2 nuclear genome annotation [12].PolyA-selected, paired end mRNA sequencing data from eight E. grandis tissues (as described in [43, 44]) were aligned to all three E. grandis genomes using GSNAP with allowed mismatch set to 1 (gmap v2016-09-23 [45]). Predicted editing sites of the organellar transcripts identified in the annotation step were used as SNP files for GSNAP alignment in order not to bias the alignment towards the nuclear genome. The resulting sam alignment files were converted to bam format using SAMtools view and sorted by position with SAMtools sort (SAMtools v1.3.1 [69]). The sorted bam files were then used to generate raw feature counts using HTSeq-count v0.6.1 [82] with concatenated nuclear and organellar gtf annotation files. DESeq2 v1.8.2 [83], implemented in RStudio v1.0.136 [84], was used to generated variance stabilized transformed (VST) counts and identify differentially expressed genes between immature xylem, phloem, and mature leaf tissue samples. The results were visualized using ggplot2 v2.2.1 [85] in RStudio v1.0.136.REDItools version 1.0.4 [38] was used to identify editing sites using the aligned polyA selected reads across 8 E. grandis tissues. We used the REDItoolDnaRna.py script to ensure that organellar genomic variants were not called as editing sites due to transferred DNA regions, using the Bowtie 2 [68] genomic DNA alignments to differentiate between DNA variants and RNA editing [38]. The settings used were as follows: predict C to U and G to A edits (for sense and antisense genes, respectively), editing sites must have >\u200910 reads aligned, with >\u20093 reads supporting the editing event, minimum per base quality >\u200925. We then filtered the identified editing sites based on the following parameters: No DNA variants in the site, sense orientation with organellar gene coding regions (C to U for sense genes, and G to A for antisense genes). All tissue samples were bulked, and edits were identified if they were found in any dataset and were in codon position 1 or 2 of in the sense strand of plastid and mitochondrial genes.Base pairsInverted repeatNuclear mitochondrial DNANuclear plastidial DNAPolyadenylatedSingle copySingle nucleotide polymorphismUntranslated regionVariance stabilizing transformationWhole genome sequencingThis work was supported by the Department of Science and Technology (Strategic Grant for the Eucalyptus Genomics Platform) and National Research Foundation of South Africa (Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics Programme, Grants 86936 and 97911 to A.A.M.), Sappi South Africa, the Technology and Human Resources for Industry Programme (Grant 80118) through the Forest Molecular Genetics Programme at the University of Pretoria (to A.A.M.), and D.P. is supported by the National Research Foundation of South Africa Scarce Skills grant.FastQ files of the whole genome sequencing of E. grandis TAG0014 mature leaf tissue are available at the Sequence Read Archive under the project accession PRJNA433608 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=PRJNA433608).

The assembled mitochondrial genome is a single scaffold of 478,813\u2009bp, with average GC content of 44.8% (Fig.\u00a01a and b, Table\u00a01). The average coverage of the WGS reads across the mitochondrial genome is ~\u2009700, with regions of ten times the average coverage representing overlaps between the plastid and mitochondrial genomes (Fig. 1b) Repeat elements make up 2.47% of the E. grandis mitochondrial genome, consisting mainly of simple and low complexity repeats (Table 1, Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S1). We identified 19 direct repeat regions larger than 100\u2009bp in the E. grandis mitochondrial genome, the largest of which is 4210\u2009bp long (Fig. 1b, Additional\u00a0file\u00a02). Additionally, we identified 11 inverted repeat regions longer than 100\u2009bp in the E. grandis mitochondrial genome, the largest of which is 1352\u2009bp (Fig. 1b, Additional\u00a0file\u00a02). Due to the fact that we could not assemble a circular mitochondrial genome for E. grandis from whole genome sequencing data, we considered that the genome may indeed be present as a linear molecule, or as sub-genomic molecules that arise via recombination of the repeat regions [13]. We did not find evidence of sub-genomic molecules from the depth of coverage across the mitochondrial genome assembly (Fig. 1b). We used SVDetect to determine if any structural variations exist by filtering the alignment file based on the distance and orientation of aligned reads, along with removing any reads whose mate mapped to the nuclear or plastid genomes [14]. The SVDetect defined breakpoints were cross-referenced with the large repeat regions, and the results suggest that most repeat regions are not mediating mitochondrial sub-genomic molecules, as 8 breakpoints are within 250\u2009bp of a repeat region and are found to predominantly be supported by less than 100 read pairs, with three being supported by 309, 219, and 163 read pairs (Additional\u00a0file\u00a03). Of these, direct repeat 13 shows evidence of repeat mediated structural variation, supported by 219 read pairs (Additional\u00a0file\u00a04: Figure S1). Any other alternate conformations present in the E. grandis mitochondrial genome could not be identified using this data and could be further assessed using long-read sequencing in the future.\n\nFig. 1\nMitochondrial genome of E. grandis. a.

The vast majority of the E. grandis mitochondrial genome is non-coding, with ~\u200913% comprising of protein coding regions, and ~\u20096% of introns. The mitochondrial protein coding genes are all single copy genes, with no duplications present (Table 2). The E. grandis mitochondrial genome does not contain any sequences similar to the ribosomal protein subunit genes rps11, rps8, and rpl6, which have been lost in angiosperms [15, 16]. Short fragments of rps2 (141\u2009nt) and rps19 (42 and 69\u2009nt) were found, but no full-length copies of these genes were present. The gene content was similar to other sequenced land plant mitochondrial genomes [17], with no genes exclusively lost in E. grandis. Ten E. grandis mitochondrial genes contain introns, with three of these, nad1, nad2, and nad5, being trans-spliced (Fig. 1a, Table 2). There are 16 single copy tRNA genes in the E. grandis mitochondrial genome, with two copies each of tRNA-Asn, tRNA-Met, tRNA-Tyr and tRNA-fMet (Fig. 1a, Table 1, Table 2). The mitochondrial genome of E. grandis contains four rRNA genes, with two copies of 5S rRNA present (Fig. 1a, Tables 1, 2).Table 2\nE. grandis mitochondrial genome gene content\n\nGenes with multiple exons are denoted with the number of exons shown in parenthesis, and trans-spliced genes are indicated with *. tRNAs underlying plastid transferred regions are indicated with pl. a Note that rpl16 is annotated as a pseudogene due to an internal stop codon, but this gene has an in-frame GUG present downstream from the ATG start codon, which may be used as a start codon as in other plant species\nAlthough the plastid genome of E. grandis has been previously reported [21], some discrepancies in gene content exist when compared to other published Eucalyptus plastid genomes [22]. Eucalyptus plastid genomes typically contain 85 protein coding genes [22], and the available E. grandis plastid genome (NC_014570.1) contains 74 annotated protein coding genes [21, 23]. In the assembly reported here, the plastid genome of E. grandis was assembled using whole genome sequencing data (as above for the mitochondrial genome) and was subsequently annotated (Fig.\u00a02a). The assembled plastid genome of E. grandis is 160,109\u2009bp long, having the quadripartite structure of most land plant plastid genomes, with two large inverted repeat (IR) regions that are flanked by two single copy (SC) regions (small- SSC and large- LSC) (Fig. 2a). Coverage of the WGS reads aligned to the assembled plastid genome shows high coverage of 3500x across the length of the genome (Fig. 2b, Table 1). The high coverage of reads mapped give confidence in the downstream annotation and analysis of the assembled plastid genome.\n\nFig. 2\nPlastid genome of E. grandis. a.

The GC content is represented in the innermost circle with the inverted repeat (IR) and single copy (SC) regions indicated. The figure was generated in OGDraw [77]. b. Genome coverage of E. grandis WGS reads in log2 scale (Log coverage) across the plastid genome. WGS reads were mapped with Bowtie 2 [78] and visualized in IGV [79]. The position of the plastid inverted repeat regions are shown below (Repeats) in grey\nIn order to identify transferred DNA between the nuclear and organellar genomes of E. grandis, we used BLAST analysis to identify sequences of significant homology between the three genomes. After filtering the BLAST analysis results for sequences longer than 100\u2009bp with e-values <\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2212\u20093 and identity >\u200975%, we found a total of 751,886\u2009bp of plastid origin and 1,256,558\u2009bp of mitochondrial origin the nuclear genome (Fig.\u00a03, Additional\u00a0file\u00a09: Table S2). The nuclear regions of organellar homology are distributed across all chromosomes of the nuclear genome (Fig. 3, Additional file 9: Table S2), with the largest proportion found on chromosome 5 for plastid DNA (88,691\u2009bp), and chromosome 8 for mitochondrial DNA (193,727\u2009bp). The mitochondrial genome of E. grandis consists of 6% (28,123\u2009bp) chloroplast-like DNA sequences over 18 regions, with transfers ranging from 7281\u2009bp to 152\u2009bp in length. A single plastid gene, psbM, has been transferred and annotated in the E. grandis mitochondrial genome. We find that eight tRNA genes in the mitochondrial genome overlap with plastid transferred regions (indicated by pl in Table 2). BLAST analyses of the inter-organellar DNA transfers against all NCBI land plant organellar genomes show that inter-organellar DNA transfers are from the plastid to the mitochondria, and that no mitochondrial to plastid DNA transfer has taken place in E. grandis (Additional\u00a0file\u00a010: Table S3, Additional\u00a0file\u00a011).\n\nFig. 3\nDNA and gene transfer between nuclear and organellar genomes in E. grandis. The outer track shows the relevant chromosomes of E. grandis, the inner track shows complete coding regions of NUMTs and NUPTs in red and green respectively. The red (mitochondria) and green (plastid) dots indicate full length gene transfers from the organelles to the nuclear genome. The ribbons represent DNA transfers identified by BLAST analysis greater than 500\u2009nt, with percentage identity greater than 75%. Red ribbons indicate mitochondrial to nuclear DNA transfer, green ribbons indicate plastid to nuclear DNA transfer, and blue ribbons represent plastid to mitochondrial DNA transfer. For clarity, the scale of the plastid and mitochondrial genome size has been increased by 100x\nIn order to assess whether the E. grandis NUMTs and NUPTs identified above are functionally expressed, we aligned polyA-selected reads (from [43, 44]) to the nuclear genome, and compared read counts with the same reads aligned to the nuclear and organellar genomes (Fig.\u00a04). To ensure that the reads aligned accurately to the organellar genomes, GSNAP was used with predicted organellar transcript editing sites defined as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [45]. Evidence from eight tissues specific datasets revealed that organellar transferred genes in the nuclear genome are not functionally expressed (Fig. 4). The reads aligning to the nuclear genome (Fig. 4a) were drastically reduced when mapped to all three genomes simultaneously (Fig. 4b), and instead, mapped preferentially to the organellar genomes (Fig. 4c).\n\nFig. 4\nPoly-A selected RNA read abundance of nuclear genes with homology or annotation suggesting organellar transfer (a. and b.), and organellar encoded genes (c.) aligned to the nuclear genome only (blue) and the nuclear and organellar genomes of E. grandis (green). a.

(DOCX 14 kb)", "s12864-019-5560-1": "With the unprecedented rapid growth rate (up to 2.75\u2009cm/day), velvet antler is an invaluable model for the identification of potent growth factors and signaling networks for extremely fast growing tissues, mainly cartilage. Antler growth center (AGC) locates in its tip and consists of five tissue layers: reserve mesenchyme (RM), precartilage (PC), transition zone (TZ), cartilage (CA) and mineralized cartilage (MC). The aim of this study was to investigate the transcription dynamics in the AGC using RNA-seq technology.Five tissue layers in the AGC were collected from three 3-year-old male sika deer using our previously reported sampling method (morphologically distinguishable). After sequencing (15 samples; triplicates/tissue layer), we assembled a reference transcriptome de novo and used RNA-seq to measure gene expression profiles across these five layers. Nine differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were selected from our data and subsequently verified using qRT-PCR. The results showed a high consistency with the RNA-seq results (R2\u2009=\u20090.80). Nine modules were constructed based on co-expression network analysis, and these modules contained 370 hub genes. These genes were found to be mainly involved in mesenchymal progenitor cell proliferation, chondrogenesis, osteogenesis and angiogenesis. Combination of our own results with the previously published reports, we found that Wnt signaling likely plays a key role not only in stimulating the antler stem cells or their immediate progeny, but also in promoting chondrogenesis and osteogenesis during antler development.We have successfully assembled a reference transcriptome, generated gene expression profiling across the five tissue layers in the AGC, and identified nine co-expressed modules that contain 370 hub genes and genes predorminantly expressed in and highly relevant to each tissue layer. We believe our findings have laid the foundation for the identification of novel genes for rapid proliferation and chondrogenic differentiation of antler cells.Antler is an organ of cartilage/bone, and its elongation is achieved through appositional growth [1, 5]. Results from histology, histochemistry, ultrastructure, and BrdU labeling [6, 8, 9] show that the cells in the RM layer are either in mitotically quiescent state (outer sublayer) or at mitotic state (inner sublayer). Below the RM layer, the mesenchymal cells start to differentiate towards a cartilaginous lineage (PC layer), where pre-chondroblasts and newly-formed-isolated vascular streaks reside. Further below the PC layer, pre-chondroblasts gradually maturate toward chondroblasts and chondrocytes; at the same time, the rod-like vascular streaks progressively extend from the two ends in parallel with the long axis of the antler, to form the TZ layer. Within the TZ layer, different stages of cartilaginous cells including prechondroblasts, chondroblasts and chondrocytes co-exist; with different stages of the vascular system (broken and continuous vascular channels co-exist) formation. Finally, continuous cartilage columns (which mainly contain chondroblasts in the periphery and chondrocytes in the center) alternate with continuous vascular channels (functional vascular system) to form the CA layer, the vascularized cartilage (unique feature of antler cartilage). At the end of this proximal layer, chondroclasia, osteogenesis and osteoclasia take place simultaneously to form the MC layer, within which the smooth-surfaced the osteo-cartilage columns are converted into irregular and broken trabeculae [4].In order to facilitate the discovery of novel genes and/or regulatory systems for rapid antler growth and chondrogenesis using molecular techniques, we established a standardized method to allow rapid and precise sampling of each of these five tissue layers in the AGC of a fresh-cut antler based on morphologically distinguishable markers, and without having to let them undergo histological processes in order to do so [7, 9]. Unfortunately, thus far not much progress has been made in the discovery of the novel genes from the AGC since publication of the method more than a decade ago. This undesirable situation would have been at least partially attributed to the reason that the relevant studies neither used the high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technique, hence a large number of the genes were not detected due to heterologous microarray (deer cDNA versus mouse template) [10, 11]; nor applied the tissue layer sampling method in the study, hence failed to put those identified genes in the biological context [12, 13].The aim of present study was to use the novel antler model again, but this time to combine the RNA-seq technique with the published standardized tissue layer sampling method, to seek to identify novel genes and regulatory pathways that underpin the system where the fastest growth and chondrogenesis are executed.A total of 654 million (86.58 Gbp) of clean paired-end reads from 15 libraries (triplicates/tissue layer) passed the quality filters (Additional file 1: Table S1). Then, a de novo assembly pipeline was applied to these reads to generate reference transcriptome, because of lacking of a proper sika deer genome at present time (Additional file 2: Figure S1). In total 88,369 non-redundant transcripts (\u2265 300\u2009bp) with FPKM \u22650.5 were generated through this process. Based on three different coding sequence prediction methods, a total of 44,177 high-quality coding transcripts were subsequently obtained (Additional file 2: Figure S1, Additional file 3: Table S2). Of these 44,177 high-quality transcripts, the length of N50 (defined as the sequence length of the shortest contig at 50% of the total genome length) was 2533\u2009bp, which is longer than the previously published transcriptomes of the deer [12, 14, 15]. Length distribution results of the assembled transcripts showed that the coding transcripts were more abundant than the non-coding sequences in the bins of long transcripts (Additional file 4: Figure S2A). Transcript abundance was ranged from 3 to 4 orders of magnitude (Additional file 4: Figure S2B), and the coding transcripts (40\u201350%) were more abundant in the upper ranks of the distribution (Q4) than the non-coding sequences (20\u201330%) (Additional file 4: Figure S2C). Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach (CEGMA) [16] was applied to evaluate completeness of our transcript assembly, and found that a high percentage of core genes (94.35% had complete sequences; only 5.25% were partially sequenced) presented in our transcriptome data.As a gene can have multiple transcript isoforms with different length, the longest transcript of a gene in this study was selected to represent that gene. A total of 13,203 genes were generated and then annotated using the top 1 orthologous of all currently known species based on UniProt database (May 2017), including human, mouse, cattle and sheep. We further screened the characteristics of the assembled 13,203 gene sequences by comparing them with protein sequences (not incorporated in UniProt) derived from genomes of closely related species, i.e., red deer [17], white tailed deer and cattle. For this analysis, BLASTX v2.5.0+ with default search parameters was carried out. The results showed that 13,131 (99.5%) and 13,110 (99.3%) out of 13,203 genes passed BLAST matched thresholds of E-value \u226410\u2212\u20095 for cattle and white tailed deer respectively. But, the matched ratio with red deer proteins (12,145, 92.0%) was relatively low (Additional file 5: Table S3). The possible reason for this is that the current red deer genome is still not a completed version (1.96 Gbp in total). Our results also suggested that ~\u20090.5\u20130.7% gene sequences could present the low conservativeness between sika deer and these closely related species. Interestingly, the slight redundancy sequences (~\u20093.2%, Additional file 5: Table S3) could reside in these 13,203 genes although our transcriptome dataset was clustered using cd-hit-est tool (see methods). In addition, our results showed that ~\u200960% out of deer genes is likely to be expressed in the AGC (Additional file 5: Table S3), which is compatible with the number of genes expressed in other mammalian tissues (Fig. 1 refer to [18]). Overall, a high-quality reference gene dataset (13,203 genes) was successfully generated, and was further used for the downstream bioinformatics analysis in this study (Additional file 6: Figure S3).In order to detect the changes in ratio of up-regulated to down-regulated genes across the five tissue layers inversely (i.e. a proximal layer vs its every distal layer), we used the four pre-set levels of thresholds (|log2FoldChange|\u22671, 2, 3 and 4). The results showed that the higher the level the bigger the ratio (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the elevated level of up-regulated genes is positively correlated with the degree of cell differentiation (mesenchymal cells to chondrocytes) in the AGC.For clusters 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, up-regulated layer-specific genes were found to be with expression peaks in each of the five tissue layers (RM, PC, TZ, CA and MC layers). The genes in Cluster 3 had expression peaks in the RM layer and were found to be involved in cell proliferation (EASE score\u2009=\u20090.009, e.g., IGF1, EGFR), stem cell population maintenance (EASE score\u2009=\u20090.044, e.g., NOTCH2 and KIT), regulation of apoptotic process (EASE score\u2009=\u20090.02, e.g., CASP8, CASP8AP2 and TP53BP2) and DNA repair (EASE score\u2009=\u20090). The rate of antler growth can reach 2\u2009cm per day [3], and this rapid growth is achieved mainly through fast cell proliferation in the RM layer [6, 9]. The rapid rate of cell proliferation in antlers would not only require factors that stimulate fast cell proliferation, but also those that properly control the cell cycle and protect genomic stability. It is also notable that genes that were involved in epigenetic regulation, including gene silencing by RNA (EASE score\u2009=\u20090.001, e.g., AGO1 and DICER1) and histone modification (EASE score\u2009=\u20090.01, e.g., CTR9 and EP300) were found in the RM layer, strongly implying early imprinting of the stem cell populations in this layer.The genes in Cluster 4 showed an expression peak in the PC layer, and were found to be related to positive regulation of Wnt signaling (EASE score\u2009=\u20090, e.g., FGFR2 and WNT10B). The PC layer mainly consists of newly differentiated prechondroblasts, which actively form and secrete extracellular matrix [8]. Wnt signaling was detected in this Cluster (also in Clusters 2 and 3), suggesting this signaling pathway could be involved in early antler cell differentiation toward chondrogenesis.The genes in Cluster 5 showed an expression peak in the TZ layer, and were found to be related to cartilage condensation (EASE score\u2009=\u20090.02, e.g., BMP1, SOX9 and COL2A1) and response to hypoxia (EASE score\u2009=\u20090.03, e.g., AKT1 and ANGPTL4). In the TZ layer, cells are in the differentiation transition from prechondroblasts to chondroblasts and chondrocytes, with vascular channels progressing from broken (unfunctional) to continuous (functional) [9]. Cartilaginous cells at different stages of differentiation in the vicinity of unfunctional vascular channels (not yet linked to the body vascular system), or further away from the functional vascular system (linked to the body vascular system) would be subjected to low oxygen tension/hypoxia. It is not surprising that, in order to cope with this low oxygen tension, these cells would have to highly express genes that are responsive to hypoxia.The genes in Clusters 6 showed expression peaks in the CA layers. As expected, these genes were found to be related to extracellular matrix organization (EASE score\u2009=\u20090, e.g., COL10A1 and ACAN), angiogenesis (EASE score\u2009=\u20090.004, e.g., MMP14), regulation of chondrocyte differentiation (EASE score\u2009=\u20090.015, e.g., CTGF), ossification (EASE score\u2009=\u20090.03, e.g., MMP9 and TNFSF11) and bone mineralization (EASE score\u2009=\u20090.006, e.g., PTH1R), and response to hormones (EASE score\u2009=\u20090.03, e.g. LYN). The genes in Clusters 7 had expression peaks in the MC layers, and were found to regulate osteoclast differentiation (EASE score\u2009=\u20090.044, e.g., BGLAP) and negative regulation of blood coagulation (EASE score\u2009=\u20090.044, e.g., CD34). These findings support the previous ultrastructural observations, in which almost all hypertrophic chondrocytes were eventually subject to degeneration and apoptosis [8]. Programmed cell death of hypertrophic chondrocytes in both the CA and MC layers would create more space for the brought-in-osteogenic progenitor cells to build up bone tissue [20]. The seasonal high levels of androgen hormones would initiate the final antler mineralization processes, further result in the interruption of the blood flow into antlers from their bases, and cause eventual demise of antlers [21, 22]. Overall, gene expression profiling across the five tissue layers within an AGC matched the developmental states in each corresponding tissue layer.Six Wnt genes (WNT2B, WNT5A, WNT5B, WNT4, WNT10B and WNT11), and four their receptor genes (Frizzled genes; FZD1, FZD4, FZD5 and FZD9) in our hub gene pool were overrepresented. It is known that the Wnt signaling pathway plays an essential role in cartilage/bone development during embryogenesis [26\u201328]. Furthermore, the canonical Wnt signaling pathway is known to be involved in the establishment of AGC in the early antler regeneration, more specifically\u03b2-catenin is an important factor controlling survival and lineage specification of the mesenchymal progenitor cells toward chondrogenesis [29]. In our results, both Wnt genes and their receptors were identified and fell in seven of nine co-expressed modules, suggesting that this pathway may not only play an important role in promoting the proliferation of the stem cells or their immediately differentiated progeny in the AGC, but also be involved in chondrogenesis during antler development. Therefore, we think that further studies should be directed at elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the cross-interactions between Wnt signaling pathway and other local signaling pathways, such as TGF-beta and Hedgehog signaling pathways, as well as hormonal stimuli, for the regulation of antler cell proliferation, survival and chondrogenesis.Four Fox genes (FOXC1, FOXC2, FOXO1 and FOXO4) and four Sox genes (SOX8, SOX9, SOX17 and SOX18) were found to be overrepresented in our hub gene pool. FOXC2 is reported to augment tumor propagation and metastasis in osteosarcoma [30]. In contrast, FOXO1 and FOXO4 are regarded as tumor suppressor genes for certain cancers including osteosarcoma through diversified mechanisms, such as initiating apoptosis [31]. Antler growth involves fast cell proliferation that is elegantly regulated without becoming cancerous, suggesting FOXO genes play a role in the maintenance of normal antler tissue growth.Overall, we believe our results (such as 370 hub genes involved in nine co-expressed modules, particular genes that predominantly expressed in and highly revenant to each tissue layer) provide a foundation for future studies of more detailed molecular analyses to the development of the AGC. Besides, our transcriptome data would be valuable for other functional genomic research in sika deer or closely-related species. In the long term, establishing the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in regulating chondrogenesis may lead to the development of strategies for enhancing cartilage/bone repair and regeneration in other mammals including humans.Antler tissues were collected from three 3-year-old healthy sika deer (Cervus nippon) at about 30\u2009days after casting of the previous hard antlers, and processed as previously described [9]. Briefly, the distal 8\u2009cm of the growing tip was removed and sectioned sagittally along the longitudinal axis. Five layers of tissues of the tip were immediately dissected and then cut into 4\u20136\u2009mm pieces, which were then frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u2212\u200970\u2009\u00b0C for RNA preparation and sequencing.The tissue samples were rapidly grinded into fine powder by using Freezer/Mill 6770 (SPEX CertiPrep Ltd., USA). Total RNA was extracted from the sample powder using a Trizol reagent (Invitrogen Inc., Camarillo, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s procedure. RNA quality was confirmed using Bioanalyzer with a minimum RNA integrity number of 7.0. Six micrograms of total RNA were used to construct libraries according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Illumina TruSeq Library Preparation Kit v3). Libraries were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq X Ten at BGI (Shenzheng, China). We sequenced three biological replicates of each layer of tissue with 150\u2009bp paired-end sequencing.We used Trinity v2.4.1 [32] with fixed default k-mer size of 25 to carry out de novo assembly of a reference transcriptome from the quality-filtered reads. The paired-end reads were mapped to the assembled transcriptome with Bowtie2 v2.0.5 (\u2212no-mixed --no-discordant --gbar 1000 --end-to-end -k 200) [33], and abundance estimation (FPKM, fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads) was performed using RSEM v1.3.0 [34]. Next, we developed a strict pipeline to filter the assembly errors and background sequences (Additional file 2: Figure S1). Briefly, 1) Removal of short sequences (length\u2009\u2264\u2009300\u2009bp); 2) Removal of the background sequences (FPKM of all replicates in any one tissue \u22650.5); 3) Removal of the redundancy transcripts (identity \u226595%) using cd-hit-est v3.0.3 [35]; 4) Removal of non-coding transcripts. The coding transcripts (\u2265 100 amino acid) were predicted by ESTScan v2.2.1 [36] with human model and TransDecoder v2.0.1 [32], and further annotated by searching against UniProt database using BLASTX (E-value \u226410\u2212\u20095). Finally, differential gene expression analysis was conducted based on the mapped counts using DESeq2 v2.1.18 R package [37] at an adjusted Pvalue of 0.001.The mean FPKM values were clustered using Fuzzy c-means clustering from Mfuzz v2.42 R package [38]. Only genes with significant differences in expression between at least two layers (|log2FoldChange|\u2009\u2265\u20091.5, adjusted p-value \u22640.001) were used as input for this clustering analysis. The optimal number of clusters was set to 7 and the fuzzifier coefficient set to 2.01. The number of clusters was determined at which the minimum centroid distance plateau was achieved using the Dmin function (Additional file 9: Figure S4). Genes with a membership score (MS) of at least 0.5 were plotted and used as input for categorical enrichment analysis.A co-expression network was constructed using WGCNA v1.48 R package [39]. In brief, the gene FPKM matrix was subjected to a variance stabilizing transformation using DESeq2 v2.1.18 R package [37]. A soft-threshold power value of 16 was selected in this analysis, which corresponds to R2 (>\u20090.9). Co-expression modules were identified as clusters from the dendrogram using the cutreeDynamic function with a minimum module size of 30 genes. Modules with eigengene correlations no less than 0.75 were subsequently merged using the mergeCloseModules function with a height cutoff of 0.25. We then conducted module-trait correlations between the module eigengenes and libraries corresponding to each of the developmental layers.We used two bioinformatics tools (DAVID version 6.8 website [40] and GOstats v2.44 R package [41]) to perform GO enrichment analysis for the gene set from Fuzzy c-means cluster and WGCNA analysis. The DAVID version 6.8 website was used to obtain overrepresented GO BP categories with an adjusted Fisher exact P value (EASE score). The GOstats v2.44 R package was performed with Benjamini and Hochberg correction using p.adjust program in R package. The human orthologs of the corresponding deer genes were used in the GO enrichment tests to take advantage of the more complete GO annotation available for human genes.To confirm the DEGs identified from RNA-seq assay, nine highly expressed genes (see results) with great alteration expression levels were chosen and validated using qRT-PCR. The specific primers located in gene coding regions were designed using Primer 5 software and listed in Additional file 10: Table S6. Actin, cytoplasmic 1 (ACTB) was used as a standard control according to our in-house selection standard. Total RNA was firstly treated with DNase I before reverse transcription by superscript III double-stranded cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen Inc., Camarillo, CA). The qRT-PCR was then performed using the SYBR Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol using an Applied Biosystems 7500 detection system. The melting curves for verification of amplification specificity by a thermal denaturing step. The relative quantitative method (2-\u0394\u0394CT) was used to calculate the fold change in the expression levels of target genes [42]. All reactions were performed in three biological replicates using the independent RNA samples. Linear regression analysis and loess smooth plot were performed by ggplot2 R package [43].Antler growth centerBiological processCartilageCore Eukaryotic Genes Mapping ApproachDatabase for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated DiscoveryDifferentially expressed genes GO: gene ontologyFragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped readsMineralized cartilageModule membershipMembership scorePre-cartilageQuantitative reverse transcription poly chain reactionReserve mesenchymeRNA sequencingTransition zoneWeighted correlation network analysisThis work was funded by Natural Science Foundation of Jilin Province of China (No. 20170101003JC), the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. XDA16010403), and Central Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund (No. 1610342016003).

In this regard, deer antler is an invaluable model to meet these requirements. Antlers are male secondary sexual characteristics and each year form anew from the permanent frontal bony protuberances, called pedicles [1, 2]. During the growth phase, elongation of antlers in some large deer species (such as north America wapiti) can exceed 2\u2009cm/day [3], nonetheless with a well-organized tissue structure [4]. The antler growth center (AGC) is located in the antler tip [5] and histologically consists of five tissue layers from distal to proximal: reserve mesenchyme (RM), pre-cartilage (PC), transition zone (TZ), cartilage (CA) and mineralized cartilage (MC) (Fig. 1) [6, 7].\n\nFig. 1\nSchematic drawing to show the five tissue layers in an antler growth center. RM: reserve mesenchyme; PC: pre-cartilage; TZ: transition zone; CA: cartilage; MC: mineralized cartilage. This figure also presented in the Fuzzy c-means Clustering Analysis of gene expression patterns in seven clusters (see Results)\nTo assess the global variation in gene expression across the AGC tissue layers, a matrix to the normalized expression values (mapping reads, 13,203 genes) were conducted. The results of pairwise Pearson Correlation indicated that the RM layer showed a stand lone group; whereas the rest of other four layers (PC, TZ, CA and MC) clustered together as a composite group, although the first three layers (PC, TZ and CA) in the composite group were closer compared to the last layer (MC) (Fig. 2A). This finding may reflect the use of distinct regulatory genes in the RM layer compared to the other layers, possibly because the cells in the RM layer have stem cell attributes while cells in the other layers are in the different differentiating states. Principal Component Analysis were also performed, and the results showed that PC1 explained 22.9% of the overall variation, which was found too low to separate the five tissue layers but could separate the RM layer (outmost) from the MC layer (innermost). PC2 explained 19.7% of the overall variation, which was found to allow either the RM layer or the MC layer to be distinguishable from the composite group (PC, TZ and CA) (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the PC1 variation revealed a gradient of layer samples that perfectly fits their position in a proximo-distal axis of the AGC. Overall, our results suggest that the variation trajectory follows the similar pattern of the tissue layers in the AGC.\n\nFig. 2\nComparison of gene expression across five tissue layers in the antler growth center. a) Pairwise Pearson Correlations of gene expression across 15 samples (triplicates/each tissue layer). b) Principal Component Analysis of gene expression across 15 samples. c) Ratio of up-regulated to down-regulated genes across five tissue layers on different thresholds (|log2FoldChange|\u22671, 2, 3 and 4)\nTo investigate the large-scale patterns of gene expression across the five tissue layers, Fuzzy c-means clustering model was used to group 5585 DEGs (selected based on this criteria (|log2foldchange|\u2009\u2265\u20091.5, adjusted Pvalue \u22640.001)), and these DEGs were grouped into seven clusters. Of these 5585 DEGs, 2740 were selected based on their member score (MS) within the seven clusters (MS \u2267 0.5) and used for further analysis (Fig. 3, also refer to Fig. 1). Next, we performed GO enrichment analyses using genes in each cluster to identify key biological process (BP) categories (Additional file 7: Table S4). The genes in Cluster 1 mainly included those with expression levels steadily increasing over sequential differentiation processes in the AGC (from the RM layer to MC layer). As expected, these genes were mainly related to key BP categories, e.g., extracellular matrix disassembly (EASE score\u2009=\u20090.002, e.g., CTSK, CD44, MMP13 and MMP15), osteoclast differentiation (EASE score\u2009=\u20090.007, e.g., CSF1 and TNFRSF11A), angiogenesis (EASE score\u2009=\u20090.015, e.g., TNFSF12 and SOX18) and wound healing (EASE score\u2009=\u20090.049, e.g., TIMP1). The genes in Cluster 2 included those showing an opposite trend in expression level to Cluster 1; these genes were mainly related to Wnt signaling and cell polarity (EASE score\u2009=\u20090.033, e.g., FZD1, FZD2, PSMA1 and PSMA4), and osteoblast proliferation (EASE score\u2009=\u20090.002, e.g., OSR2). These findings are consistent with our histological observations in that the transition from undifferentiated mesenchymal cells to chondrocytes distoproximally across the tissue layers is gradual, along with vascularization, chondroblast maturation and chondrification [9]. In addition, these genes may also play a role in the formation of vascularized cartilage, a unique structure which is thought to be required to meet the metabolic demands for rapidly growing antler tissue [6, 9] and as a conduit for hemopoietically derived chondroclast and osteogenic progenitors [19].\n\nFig. 3\nFuzzy c-means clustering identifies general patterns of gene expression across the five tissue layers in the antler growth center (also refer to Fig. 1). The average FPKM values of DEGs (|log2FoldChange|\u2009\u2265\u20091.5, adjusted Pvalue \u22640.001) are used. The MS of a given gene within a cluster is represented in color, with red (MS\u2009=\u20091) indicating high association. The number of genes with MS\u2009\u2265\u20090.5 in clusters is also shown. For each cluster, the key genes involved in significantly enriched GO BP categories (Additional file 7: Table S4) were shown\nSequences of the obtained 13,203 genes were also analyzed to investigate the association with the chondrogenesis and angiogenesis in the AGC using Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). The results showed that majority of these genes (13,103 genes; 99.24%) were assigned to 34 modules (39\u20133329 genes per module). Of these 34 modules, nine (10,267 genes: 78.36%, marked with asterisk in Fig. 4A) were found to have significantly negative/positive module-trait correlations with the corresponding tissue layers when the |Pearson Correlation|\u2009\u2265\u20090.6 and Pvalue \u22640.01 criterion was applied, and to be enriched in the BP categories (Fig. 4B, Additional file 8: Table S5). These BP categories were concordant with the counterparts generated from our Fuzzy c-means clustering analysis. For example, the MEfloralwhite module showed a positive module-trait correlation with the CA layer and these enriched BP categories were consistent with those in Cluster 6, and partially in Cluster 1. Likewise, the MElightcyan module showed a positive module-trait correlation with the PC layer, such as Wnt signaling pathway, which is consistent with that in Cluster 4.\n\nFig. 4\nCo-expression gene networks. a) Genes (13,103) are assigned to 34 different modules (39 to 3329 genes/module). Nine modules marked with asterisks have significant BP categories identified by a hypergeometric test after adjusted Pvalue \u22640.05 and show significant negative/positive module-trait correlations with the corresponding tissue layers (|Pearson Correlation|\u2009\u2265\u20090.6 and Pvalue \u22640.01). b) For these nine modules, significantly enriched GO biological process categories are shown (Additional file 8 Table S5). For clarity, only the selected key categories are shown in the figure\nNext, we focused on highly connected intra-module hub genes in each module, and these genes had high module membership (MM) values (MM \u2267 0.7) in their respective modules. We detected 370 hub genes that might be involved in rapid antler growth, and in regulation of chondrogenesis and angiogenesis (Fig. 5). Of these hub genes, 187 (50.5%) were involved in seven Fuzzy c-means clusters, and more specifically, these associated hub genes from each module belong to one or two clusters (except for 26 genes in MEgreenyellow module), further suggesting that the results between WGCNA and Fuzzy c-means analysis are consistent. Twenty nine hub genes are also shown in the previously published studies using other molecular technologies (e.g., western blot, qRT-PCR, in-situ hybridization or cDNA microarrays) (Table\u00a01); and were found to be involved in extracellular matrix organization, mineralization and degradation (e.g., COL1A1, COL2A1, COL10A, MMP9, MMP13, SPARC, IBSP, BGLAP, CTSK, ALPL MGP and MATN1), signaling molecules (e.g., IGF1, VEGF, IHH, WNT4, PTHLH, CSF1, TNFSF11 and TGFB1), receptors (e.g., FGFR1, FGFR3, PTH1R, CSF1R, CALCR and TNFRSF11A), binding (e.g., APOD) and transcriptional factors (e.g. RUNX3 and SOX9). Some of the molecules and their receptors (i.e. FGFR1, FGFR3, IHH, SOX9, PTHLH and PTH1R) in our hub gene pool are found to be expressed during embryogenesis, and reportedly regulate long bone formation and growth plate development [23, 24]. This finding supports a previous hypothesis that there is evolutionary conservation of the developmental signaling pathways that occur during embryogenesis and postnatal cartilage/bone regeneration [25].\n\nFig. 5\nExpression of 370 highly connected intra-module hub genes across the five tissue layers.

Infective juveniles penetrate their host through the cuticle, complete their growth within the hemocoel and eventually kill the host upon their emergence. Hence, mermithid nematodes are considered potential biological control agents of insect pests. Our previous data indicate that the infection rate of O. sinensis on cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) is low, which may be largely due to the strong immune system of the host. However, current knowledge on the interactions of mermithid nematodes with their hosts and the mechanisms employed by hosts to defend themselves against mermithid nematodes is limited.Here, we investigated the response of H. armigera to O. sinensis infection. Parasitism by O. sinensis caused a sharp decline in the survival rate of H. armigera. The hemocytic phagocytosis ability, antibacterial activity, and phenoloxidase (PO) activity in plasma of H. armigera increased at 1 d post parasitism (dpp) but decreased at 3 dpp. Further, we investigated gene expression in the fat body of parasitized and non-parasitized H. armigera larvae at 1, 3, and 5 dpp using a digital gene expression system. In total, 41, 60 and 68 immune-related differentially expressed genes were identified at 1, 3, and 5 dpp, respectively. These genes encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), serine proteases (SPs), SP inhibitors, mucins and other immune-related proteins. The expression of most PRRs, AMPs, SPs, and mucins was upregulated in the fat body of larvae at 1 dpp, downregulated at 3 dpp, and then again upregulated at 5 dpp by O. sinensis. The increased expression of SP inhibitors may contribute to the inhibited PO activity at 5 dpp.This study demonstrates that parasitism by O. sinensis modulates the immune reaction of the host H. armigera by altering the expression of immune-related genes. Our data provide a basis for future investigation of the molecular mechanisms employed by the mermithid nematode O. sinensis to modulate the immunity of the host H. armigera. These data will also likely facilitate the improvement of success in parasitism of H. armigera by O. sinensis.Insects are one of the most successful species on earth. They occupy diverse habitats and survive under different biotic and abiotic stresses. To combat microbial or parasitic infections, insects have evolved cellular and humoral immune responses, which are initiated rapidly following the recognition of pathogens by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Cellular immune responses involve hemocyte-mediated encapsulation, phagocytosis, and nodulation, whereas humoral immune responses mainly involve the induction of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and prophenoloxidase (PPO) activating system [1, 2].Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) naturally infect and kill insects, thus representing a crucial alternative to chemicals for pest control [3, 4]. Nematodes employ different strategies to survive within the host insect, either by evading or suppressing the host immune response. EPNs belonging to the families Heterorhabditidae and Steinernematidae are well studied and widely used for pest control [3, 5]. Infective juveniles of the nematodes release symbiotic bacteria into the hemocoel after entering the insect host, thus killing the host within 24 to 48\u2009h. Virulence factors such as toxin complexes, lipases, proteases, and lipopolysaccharides produced by symbiotic bacteria suppress host immune response [6, 7].Despite impressive advances in the immune response of insects to microbial infection, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in host\u2013nematode interactions and host antiparasitic immune reactions remains obscure. Some studies suggest that nematodes modulate the host immune system via symbiotic bacteria. For example, Heterorhabditid nematodes are either not recognized or less efficiently recognized by the host immune system, and the induced PRRs of the host are response to the symbiotic bacteria of nematodes [8]. Similarly, the transcription of several AMP genes is activated in Manduca and Drosophila larvae upon infection with Heterorhabditis associated with the symbiotic bacteria Photorhabdus but not upon infection with axenic worms lacking the symbiotic bacteria [8, 9]. Other studies indicate that nematodes alone alter the transcription of certain immune-related genes. For example, infection of axenic Heterorhabditis nematodes results in the induction of several immune-related genes in adult flies [10]. Transcripts of several PRRs, serine proteases (SPs), SP inhibitors (serpins), and AMPs vary in Armigeres subalbatus mosquitoes infected with the filarial parasite Brugia malayi [11].The developing stages of mermithid nematodes are parasitic, whereas the adults are free-living. Infective juveniles parasitize their host by penetrating through the cuticle. Once parasitism is established, the juveniles complete their growth inside the host, typically reaching impressive sizes. The juveniles eventually kill the host upon their emergence, suggesting the potential of mermithids for the biocontrol of insect pests. Ovomermis sinensis, a mermithid nematode, has been reported to display a broad host range, including lepidopteran pests such as the cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) [12]. Li et al. (2009) have demonstrated that parasitism with O. sinensis changes the spreading behavior of hemocytes and suppresses hemocytic encapsulation abilities of H. armigera [13]. We have previously shown that H. armigera C-type lectin 3 (CTL3) binds to the surface of O. sinensis and contributes to antiparasitic immune response [14].However, the interactions of mermithid nematodes with their hosts and the immune response of the host to infection are poorly understood. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of parasitism by O. sinensis on the survival, phagocytosis ability, antibacterial activity, and PO activity of H. armigera. Further, gene expression dynamics in the fat body of parasitized and non-parasitized H. armigera larvae were investigated, and differentially expressed immune-related genes were obtained. These data improve our understanding of host\u2013nematode interactions, and provide a comprehensive resource for exploring the molecular mechanism employed by the mermithid nematode O. sinensis to modulate the immune system of H. armigera.To explore the molecular mechanism employed by O. sinensis to alter host immunity, we compared digital gene expression (DGE) profiles in the fat body of parasitized (FP) and non-parasitized (control; FC) H. armigera larvae. FP and FC were dissected from larvae at 1 (FP1, FC1), 3 (FP3, FC3), and 5 (FP5, FC5) dpp, and three biological replicates were performed at each time point. Parasitism by O. sinensis delays H. armigera larval development. FP1 and FC1 represent fat bodies both of fifth-instar larvae at feeding stage. FP3 and FC3 correspond to fat bodies of fifth-instar larvae at head capsule slippage (HCS) and sixth-instar larvae at feeding stage, respectively. FP5 and FC5 represent fat bodies of sixth-instar larvae at feeding stage and metamorphic stage, respectively. In total, 18 RNA-Seq libraries (FP1\u20131, \u2212\u20092, \u2212\u20093; FC1\u20131, \u2212\u20092, \u2212\u20093; FP3\u20131, \u2212\u20092, \u2212\u20093; FC3\u20131, \u2212\u20092, \u2212\u20093; FP5\u20131, \u2212\u20092, \u2212\u20093; FC5\u20131, \u2212\u20092, \u2212\u20093) were constructed and sequenced. The number of raw reads generated from each library ranged from 23.96 to 27.92 million, whereas the number of cleaned reads ranged from 21.01 to 23.62 million. Cleaned reads from each library were mapped to previously assembled unigenes of H. armigera fat body [15], with a mapping ratio ranging from 49.36 to 58.76% (average 52.91%) (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Table S1).To compare the differential gene expression profiles between FP and FC larvae at different time points (FP1 vs. FC1; FP3 vs. FC3; FP5 vs. FC5), fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped fragments (FPKM) were quantified. Heatmap indicated that the square of correlation coefficient ranged from 0.909\u20130.99, 0.975\u20130.993, 0.994\u20130.996, 0.871\u20130.977, 0.978\u20130.99, and 0.912\u20130.99 in FC1, FC3, FC5, FP1, FP3, and FP5 groups, respectively (Additional\u00a0file\u00a03: Figure S2). These high Pearson values suggest the reliable replications and the reasonable samples.Four differentially expressed PRRs [Gram negative binding protein (GNBP) precursor, peptidoglycan recognition protein B (PGRP B), PGRP C, and PGRP D] were shared between FP1 vs. FC1 and FP3 vs. FC3 comparisons, all of which were upregulated in FP1 vs. FC1 and downregulated in FP3 vs. FC3. The PGRP A and CTL3 genes were downregulated, whereas CTL was upregulated in both FP3 vs. FC3 and FP5 vs. FC5 comparisons. No overlap in the PRRs that showed differentially expressed between FP1 vs. FC1 and FP5 vs. FC5. Additionally, six differentially expressed PRRs (hemolin, CTL4, CTL6, CTL7, CTL8, and CTL10 precursor) were shared among FP1 vs. FC1, FP3 vs. FC3, and FP5 vs. FC5; the expression of hemolin, CTL4 and CTL6 was first increased in FP1 vs. FC1, decreased in FP3 vs. FC3, and then again increased in FP5 vs. FC5 (Fig. 4A).Five differentially expressed AMPs (lysozyme-like protein 1, lysozyme precursor, gloverin precursor, moricin, and cobatoxin) were shared between FP3 vs. FC3 and FP5 vs. FC5. No overlap in the AMP transcripts that showed differentially expressed either between FP1 vs. FC1 and FP3 vs. FC3 or between FP1 vs. FC1 and FP5 vs. FC5. Of the differentially expressed AMP genes, three (gloverin, gloverin-like and cecropin 3) were shared among FP1 vs. FC1, FP3 vs. FC3, and FP5 vs. FC5. All of AMP genes identified were upregulated in FP1 vs. FC1, downregulated in FP3 vs. FC3 and upregulated in FP5 vs. FC5, with the exception of cobatoxin and lysozyme, which were downregulated in FP5 vs. FC5 (Fig. 4B).Two differentially expressed SP genes (SP24, SP30) and one differentially expressed SP inhibitor gene (SP inhibitor 100A) were shared between FP1 vs. FC1 and FP3 vs. FC3. Two additional differentially expressed SPs (SP HP21 precursor, SP10) were shared between FP1 vs. FC1 and FP5 vs. FC5, and three differentially expressed SP inhibitors (SP inhibitor 003, 28, and 31) were shared between FP3 vs. FC3 and FP5 vs. FC5. Among the differentially expressed SP genes, eight (SP, SP4, diverged SP, SP-like protein 1, azurocidin-like SP, putative SP, SP36, and SP52) were shared among FP1 vs. FC1, FP3 vs. FC3, and FP5 vs. FC5; the expression of all of these eight genes was upregulated in FP1 vs. FC1 and FP5 vs. FC5, whereas downregulated in FP3 vs. FC3 with the exception of SP-like protein 1 and putative SP, which were upregulated. Additionally, nine SP inhibitor genes (serpin, serpin-6, SP inhibitor 003, 004, 010, 6 precursor, 7 precursor, 8 precursor and 31) were upregulated in FP5 vs. FC5 (Fig. 4C).Six mucin genes [mucin protein, intestinal mucin (IIM) 2, 3, 4, IIM15, and IIM86] were upregulated in FP1 vs. FC1, downregulated in FP3 vs. FC3, and again upregulated in FP5 vs. FC5. The abundance of PPO-1 transcripts was inhibited in FP1 vs. FC1, whereas transcripts of prophenoloxidase activating enzyme (PAE) were suppressed in FP3 vs. FC3. The PPO-1, PPO-2, and PAE transcripts were increased in FP5 vs. FC5 (Fig. 4D).Unlike EPNs (Heterorhabditidae and Steinernematidae) that kill their host within 24\u201348\u2009h post infection, the mermithid nematode O. sinensis killed most of the H. armigera larvae within 9\u201313 dpp in this study. The efficient insecticidal effect of Heterorhabditidae and Steinernematidae is due to their symbiotic bacteria, which are released within the insect hemocoel and secrete virulence factors [6, 7]. Hence, this nematode-bacteria symbiosis is crucial for efficient action of EPNs in pest control [16]. The mermithid nematode Strelkovimermis spiculatus serves as a vector of the iridescent virus [17]; however, association of mermithid nematode with symbiotic bacteria has been rarely detected [18]. Although O. sinensis was associated with bacteria, we cannot conclude whether the bacteria was symbiotic or came from outside contamination. Considering that O. sinensis kills the host mostly by emerging through the host integument, which takes a relatively long time, it is likely that O. sinensis does not harbor pathogenic bacteria.O. sinensis not only takes a long time to kill its hosts, but also exhibits a relatively low infection rate in the host H. armigera, as shown in our laboratory [14]. The low infection rate of O. sinensis on H. armigera may be largely due to the highly developed immune system of the host. Hence, clarification of the interactions between O. sinensis and its host, especially the immune response of H. armigera to O. sinensis is of vital importance. The relatively low mapping ratio of the cleaned reads to previously assembled unigenes of peptidoglycan (PGN)-challenged fat body was observed. This may reflect the differences in the transcriptional profiles between the O. sinensis-challenged fat body and the PGN-challenged one, or the insufficient sequencing depth of the previous fat body transcriptome [15]. The number of DETs between FP and FC increased along with larval development. These DETs represent a broad range of pathways, including metabolic pathways, fat digestion and absorption, fatty acid biosynthesis, steroid biosynthesis and Ribosome (data not shown). Here, we focused on molecular characterization of immune responses.Insects employ hemocytic phagocytosis against bacteria, which requires the participation and coordination of both cellular and humoral factors. Several humoral PRRs such as opsonic factors, secreted mainly from fat body, function in non-self recognition and triggering phagocytosis [19, 20]. Since the phagocytosis ability of H. armigera is largely due to PRRs, which attach to hemocytes, variation in the expression levels of genes encoding PRRs at different time points post parasitism by O. sinensis would have important consequences. The expression of many PRR genes is consistent with the phagocytosis ability of H. armigera, as some PRR proteins are involved in phagocytosis. For example, PGRP D has previously been demonstrated to promote phagocytosis of E. coli in H. armigera [21]. In this study, the upregulation and downregulation of PGRP D expression at 1 and 3 dpp by O. sinensis, respectively, were consistent with the phagocytosis ability of H. armigera at these time points. Similar dynamic expression of PRRs has also been detected in A. subalbatus in response to B. malayi infection, with a PGRP transcript upregulated at 1\u2009h post infection and a CTL transcript downregulated at 12 or 24\u2009h post infection [11].The EPN Steinernema feltiae modulates hemocytic phagocytosis by removing opsonic factors from the host hemolymph, thus supporting its symbiotic bacteria [22]. Since O. sinensis most likely does not need to support symbiotic bacteria, initial infection of O. sinensis is presumed to activate the host immune system, for example by activating phagocytosis. In addition to the role of PRRs in phagocytosis, some PRRs also participate in encapsulation. For example, infection of A. subalbatus with the filarial worm Dirofilaria immitis leads to induction of \u03b21,3-glucan recognition protein, a PRR involved in encapsulation [23]. Although the expression of most PRR genes was upregulated in H. armigera at 1 dpp by O. sinensis, encapsulation was suppressed possibly because of the destruction of hemocyte cytoskeleton, as demonstrated previously [13]. Parasitization also suppresses host cellular encapsulation by inhibiting the expression of PRRs such as CTL and scavenger receptor [24, 25]. Given that PGRP D and CTL3 have been previously demonstrated to promote encapsulation [14, 21], we speculate that the decreased expression of certain PRRs at 3 dpp would facilitate the survival of O. sinensis within the homocoel of H. armigera.Antimicrobial effectors such as AMPs are mainly synthesized in fat body and subsequently secreted into the hemolymph, and play important roles in the restriction or elimination of the invading pathogen [26]. Infection of Aedes aegypti with Wuchereria bancrofti filarial nematodes has been shown to increase mRNA levels of defensin, cecropin and transferrin [27]. Some researchers argue that the upregulation of AMP transcripts may be attributed to symbiotic bacteria, considering it is symbiotic nematodes but not axenic nematodes that induced the transcription of AMP genes [8, 9]. Other studies have raised the possibility that the increased expression of immune-related genes (including AMPs) reflects strategies for tolerating tissue damage caused by nematodes [28]. Cecropin was reported to attenuate the motility of the filarial nematode Brugia pahangi in vitro and reduce the number of B. pahangi in vivo [29]. Hence, we speculate that the expression of AMP genes is increased in response to either O. sinensis or bacteria associated with O. sinensis, which needs further investigation.To establish infection, nematodes must be capable of suppressing the immunity of their host. Nematodes modulate the humoral and cellular immune responses of the host by producing molecules such as proteases. For example, symbiotic Heterorhabditis bacteriophora secrete a proteinase into the bodies of greater wax moth larvae and inhibit the expression of cecropin [30]. In this study, we showed upregulation of AMP genes in H. armigera at 1 dpp by O. sinensis and downregulation at 3 dpp; this was consistent with the antibacterial activity in plasma. The AMP genes exhibit similar expression profiles in A. subalbatus at different time points post infection by filarial worm. For example, the expression of two cecropin genes is increased at 6\u2009h post infection and that of two defensin and two lysozyme genes is decreased at 12\u2009h post infection [11]. Since molecules produced by O. sinensis have not yet been characterized, the mechanisms employed by O. sinensis to suppress the immunity of the host remain unclear. Interestingly, we observed upregulation of AMP genes and enhanced antibacterial activity in H. armigera larvae at 5 dpp by O. sinensis, possibly because O. sinensis may have developed sufficiently during 5 d to endure higher immune stress. Mucin is reported to be involved in the entrapment of bacteria [31]. In this study, mucin genes exhibited a similar expression profile as the AMP genes; thus, it is likely that mucins function in antiparasitic immunity and contribute toward antibacterial activity in plasma.SPs and SP inhibitors (serpins) play important roles in melanin biosynthesis, and are most likely involved in antiparasitic immunity [32, 33]. Global transcriptional response of A. aegypti to B. malayi infection has revealed an increase in the abundance of several SP transcripts [28]. Transcriptional levels of 30 SP or serpin genes vary in A. subalbatus at different time points following infection by B. malayi [11], suggesting a potential role of melanization in antiparasitic immunity. In this study, the abundance of most SP transcripts in H. armigera larvae parasitized by O. sinensis increased at 1 dpp and decreased at 3 dpp. Given that SP functions in the activation of PPO and is required for parasite melanization [34, 35], it is reasonable that PO activity in plasma slightly increased at 1 dpp and decreased at 3 dpp. However, at 5 dpp, the abundance of most of the SP transcripts increased, whereas PO activity decreased. This may be because of the increased abundance of SP inhibitor transcripts, as serpin inhibits the activation of PPO by SP [36].Some virulence factors produced by parasites during infection protect them against the potent effects of the immune system of the host and improve the success rate of parasitism. For example, a trypsin-like serine protease and a chymotrypsin serine protease secreted during the parasitic phase of Steinernema carpocapsae exhibit PPO inhibitory activity [37, 38]. Here we showed that O. sinensis parasitism modulated PO activity of H. armigera larvae by altering the expression of SPs and serpins, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.Overall, our data revealed dynamic immune responses of H. armigera to O. sinensis infection. The initial infection of H. armigera by O. sinensis activated the expression of many PRR, AMP, SP, and mucin genes, which is consistent with the enhanced immune reactions of the host (phagocytosis, antibacterial activity, and PO activity). Subsequently, O. sinensis suppressed these immune reactions by inhibiting the expression of most PRR, AMP, SP, and mucin genes to facilitate its survival within the host. After the successful establishment of O. sinensis parasitism, we speculate that O. sinensis was able to endure the relatively higher immune-related stress (such as antibacterial activity) presumably because it has grown to a sufficiently large size within 5 dpp. However, the inhibited PO activity at 5 dpp may be attributed to the increased expression of serpins, suggesting that O. sinensis is more sensitive to melanization. We provide a comprehensive resource for exploring the complex molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between the mermithid nematode O. sinensis and its host H. armigera. Further investigation of DEGs between FP and FC would provide critical target genes for improvement of infection rate. Characterization of virulence factors produced by O. sinensis and elucidation of the mechanism employed by O. sinensis to suppress host immunity will also be our future study. Our findings will likely facilitate the development of O. sinensis as an effective and eco-friendly biological control agent.H. armigera larvae were maintained in the laboratory at 28\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u2009\u00b0C, 70% relative humidity and 14\u2009h light/10\u2009h dark photoperiod. Larvae were reared on an artificial diet mainly made from wheat germ and soybean powder [39].A colony of adult O. sinensis nematodes was collected from a wheat field in Shangcai, Henan, China. These nematodes were maintained in the laboratory until infective juveniles were obtained. Approximately one thousand juveniles were applied for genomic DNA extraction using a bacterial DNA kit (OMEGA, USA). The primers (Additional\u00a0file\u00a06: Table S4) were designed to amplify the V4-V5 region of 16S rRNA. Then PCR reactions were performed with 30\u2009ng of genomic DNA as a template.Fifteen juvenile nematodes were used to infect a fourth-instar larva of H. armigera for 3\u2009h, as described previously [14]. After successful parasitization by O. sinensis, H. armigera larvae continued to feed on artificial diet until the emergence of fully developed nematodes. The number of dead larvae was recorded every day. Infected larvae, which died before the emergence of fully developed nematodes, were dissected to confirm whether the juveniles succeeded in penetrating. Survival curves were created and analyzed using GraphPad software. Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was performed to calculate statistical significance.Hemolymph was collected from parasitized and non-parasitized larvae at various time points, and diluted 3-fold in sterile anticoagulant buffer. After centrifugation at 1000\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min, cell-free plasma was obtained, and antibacterial activity was determined as described previously [15]. Briefly, 90\u2009\u03bcl of plasma was mixed with 10\u2009\u03bcl of E. coli suspension. After incubation for 1\u2009h at room temperature, the plasma\u2013bacteria mixture was plated onto lysogeny broth agar plates and incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C overnight. Subsequently, the number of colony forming units (CFU) was counted in each plate.To evaluate the effect of parasitism by O. sinensis on PO activity of H. armigera, plasma was collected from parasitized and non-parasitized larvae at various time points. PO activity was measured as described previously [41]. Briefly, plasma (50\u2009\u03bcl) was incubated with 50\u2009\u03bcl trypsin (2\u2009mg/ml) for 20\u2009min at room temperature, followed by addition of 50\u2009\u03bcl substrate solution containing dopamine (3\u2009mg/ml). Initial absorbance was measured at 490\u2009nm, and one unit of PO activity was defined as the amount of enzyme yielding an increase of 0.001 absorbance units per min.To prepare DGE libraries, three biological replicates of FP and FC samples were collected at 1, 3 and 5 dpp. Total RNA was extracted from these samples using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen), and used with oligo dT magnetic beads to enrich mRNAs. The mRNA samples were then fragmented into short sequences and reverse transcribed using N6 random primer. Subsequently, the resulting double-stranded complimentary DNA was end-repaired to generate blunt ends and ligated with two blunt end adaptors. Following PCR amplification, the PCR products were denatured, and single-stranded DNA was cyclized using splint oligo. The prepared libraries were subjected to SE50 sequencing at the Beijing Genomics Institute.The high number of unknown bases, adaptor sequences and low quality reads were filtered from raw sequence reads to generate clean reads. Clean reads were then mapped onto reference sequences of H. armigera fat body transcriptome generated previously [15] using Bowtie2 [42]. To eliminate the influence of gene length and sequencing discrepancy, gene transcripts were quantified as FPKM values for comparing expression levels of DETs among samples. Correction for false positive and false negative errors were performed using false discovery rates (FDR), with FDR\u2009\u2264\u20090.001 as the default threshold to judge the significance of gene expression differences. Definition of divergence probability of each transcript differentially expressing was following the formula described previously [43]. Values of |log2 fold-change|\u2009\u2265\u20091 and divergence probability \u22650.8 were used as cut-off thresholds for identifying DETs between the different experimental conditions, based on a non-parametric algorithm NOISeq-sim [44].Results of RNA-Seq analysis were validated using qRT-PCR. Total RNA (2\u2009\u03bcg) prepared for RNA-Seq was used for the synthesis of first-strand cDNA. Subsequently, qRT-PCR was conducted with TransStart Top Green qPCR SuperMix (TransGen Bio-tech, Beijing, China) using a CF\u2009\u00d7\u200996 system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). A total of eight differentially expressed genes, including PRRs (CTL4, CTL7), AMPs (gloverin, cecropin 3), SPs (SP4, azurocidin-like SP), and mucins (mucin protein, mucin 4), were selected for qRT-PCR analyses. The expression level of each gene was normalized relative to that of the reference gene \u03b2-actin using the 2-\u0394CT method (\u0394CT\u2009=\u2009CT[test gene] - CT[\u03b2-actin]).

The survival rate of parasitized larvae was much lower than that of the mock group, and all infected larvae died within 13 d post parasitism (dpp) (Fig.\u00a01A). Juveniles of O. sinensis initially got fully developed at 9 dpp and emerged through the integument of the host, thereby killing the larvae (Fig. 1B). During the emergence of O. sinensis from 9 to 13 dpp, the parasitized group of H. armigera remained sixth-instar larvae while the mock group was pupae.\n\nFig. 1\nParasitism by Ovomermis sinensis decreased Helicoverpa armigera survival. (a) Survival curves of H. armigera larvae infected with O. sinensis (red line; n\u2009=\u200950) in comparison with non-parasitized larvae (control; blue line; n\u2009=\u200950). O. sinensis emergence started at 9 d post parasitism (dpp), causing a sharp decline in the survival rate of H. armigera larvae. Significant difference (p\u2009<\u20090.0001, Log-rank test) was observed between O. sinensis-infected larvae and control groups. (b) O. sinensis emerged partially (upper panel) or completely (lower panel) from H. armigera larva\nTo test whether O. sinensis modulates the host immune response, we compared phagocytosis, antibacterial activity, and PO activity in plasma between parasitized and non-parasitized H. armigera larvae. The results showed that hemocytic phagocytosis of Escherichia coli was enhanced at 1 dpp and then decreased at 3 dpp, with no significant differences at 5 dpp (Fig.\u00a02A and B). Antibacterial activities in the plasma were promoted at 1 and 5 dpp and reduced at 3 dpp (Fig. 2C). Plasma PO activity was slightly increased at 1 dpp, and then significantly reduced at 3 and 5 dpp (Fig. 2D). Since parasitism by O. sinensis enhanced phagocytosis and antibacterial activity in host at 1 dpp, we wonder whether O. sinensis was associated with bacteria. PCR analyses indicated that O. sinensis juveniles harbored bacteria (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figure S1).\n\nFig. 2\nDynamic immune responses of H. armigera larvae infected with O. sinensis.

A total of 1687 DETs were identified from the FP1 vs. FC1, of which 647 were upregulated and 1040 were downregulated. A total of 1352 DETs were upregulated and 1098 DETs were downregulated from the FP3 vs. FC3, whereas 5459 DETs were upregulated and 2221 DETs were downregulated from the FP5 vs. FC5 (Fig.\u00a03 and Additional\u00a0file\u00a04: Table S2).\n\nFig. 3\nComparisons of differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) between the FP1 and FC1, FP3 and FC3, and FP5 and FC5. The FP1, FP3, and FP5 represent the fat body of H. armigera larvae parasitized by O. sinensis at 1, 3, and 5 dpp, respectively. The FC1, FC3, and FC5 represent the fat body of non-parasitized larvae (controls) collected at the same time points. The number of upregulated DETs is indicated in the red column, whereas the number of downregulated DETs is represented in green\nOf the 1687 DETs identified from the FP1 vs. FC1 comparison, 80 DETs representing 41 genes were involved in immunity; these encoded 11 PRRs, 4 AMPs, 12 SPs, 3 SP inhibitors, 6 mucins and 5 others. Of the 2450 DETs identified from the FP3 vs. FC3 comparison, 131 DETs representing 60 genes were involved in immunity, including 16 PRRs, 12 AMPs, 14 SPs, 4 SP inhibitors, 6 mucins and 8 others. Of the 7680 DETs identified from the FP5 vs. FC5 comparison, 209 DETs representing 68 genes were involved in immunity, including 15 PRRs, 10 AMPs, 12 SPs, 11 SP inhibitors, 6 mucins, and 14 others (Fig.\u00a04 and Additional\u00a0file\u00a05: Table S3).\n\nFig. 4\nSchematic representation of common and unique immune-related differentially expressed genes identified based on comparisons between FP and FC samples.

Two PRRs (CTL4, CTL7), two AMPs (gloverin, cecropin 3), two SPs (SP4, azurocidin-like SP), and two mucins (mucin protein, mucin 4), which were shared among FP1 vs. FC1, FP3 vs. FC3, and FP5 vs. FC5 groups, were selected for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses. The results of qRT-PCR validated RNA-Seq results (Fig.\u00a05). The expression of most SP inhibitors (serpins) was upregulated in parasitized larvae at 5 dpp, compared with non-parasitized larvae.\n\nFig. 5\nValidation of RNA-Seq data using qRT-PCR analysis. a CTL4. b CTL7. c gloverin. d cecropin 3. e SP4. f azurocidin-like SP. g mucin protein. h mucin 4.\u00a0Fat bodies were dissected from parasitized and non-parasitized H. armigera larvae, and the expression level of several immune-related genes was analyzed using qRT-PCR.

Despite their economic significance, there is a severe lack of genomic information of these pathogens. The high phylogenetic diversity observed within strains causing disease on Prunus spp. in nature, raised the question whether other strains or species within the P. syringae species complex were potentially pathogenic on Prunus spp.To gain insight into the genomic potential of adaptation and virulence in Prunus spp., a total of twelve de novo whole genome sequences of P. syringae pathovars and species found in association with diseases on cherry (sweet, sour and ornamental-cherry) and peach were sequenced. Strains sequenced in this study covered three phylogroups and four clades. These strains were screened in vitro for pathogenicity on Prunus spp. together with additional genome sequenced strains thus covering nine out of thirteen of the currently defined P. syringae phylogroups. Pathogenicity tests revealed that most of the strains caused symptoms in vitro and no obvious link was found between presence of known virulence factors and the observed pathogenicity pattern based on comparative genomics. Non-pathogenic strains were displaying a two to three times higher generation time when grown in rich medium.In this study, the first set of complete genomes of cherry associated P. syringae strains as well as the draft genome of the quarantine peach pathogen P. syringae pv. persicae were generated. The obtained genomic data were matched with phenotypic data in order to determine factors related to pathogenicity to Prunus spp. Results of this study suggest that the inability to cause disease on Prunus spp. in vitro is not the result of host specialization but rather linked to metabolic impairments of individual strains.Members of the Pseudomonas syringae species complex are hemibiotrophic plant pathogenic bacteria responsible for the development of diseases on a wide range of plant species [1\u20133] but have also been isolated from non-agricultural habitats such as rivers and snow [4, 5].Within the P. syringae species complex, more than 60 pathovars (pv.) have been defined based on the host range [6\u20139] whereas nine different genomospecies were identified by DNA:DNA hybridization experiments [10], which were later reflected by phylogroups (PGs) based on similarity of housekeeping genes [11, 12]. To date, a total of thirteen PGs have been defined within the P. syringae species complex [13]. As revealed by previous studies, many strains isolated from non-agricultural environments were phylogenetically closely related to plant associated strains and were also shown to be pathogenic on plants such as kiwifruit and tomato [13\u201315].The pathogenicity and virulence of strains belonging to the P. syringae species complex has been shown to mainly rely on the presence of a gene cluster called hrp/hrc (hypersensitive reaction and pathogenicity / hypersensitive reaction and conserved) [16, 17] which was found also in many other plant pathogenic bacteria such as Xanthomonas and Erwinia [18, 19]. This gene cluster encodes for a type III secretion system (T3SS) which delivers so-called type III effectors (T3E) into the host cell, where they act by suppressing the plant immune defences and promoting virulence by different and mostly unknown mechanisms [20\u201325]. In addition to the hrp/hrc cluster, a second cluster encoding for a T3SS orthologous to the T3SS of rhizobia was found to be present within the P. syringae species complex [26]. However, the role of this T3SS2 in pathogenicity in P. syringae is still unknown [26].The production of phytotoxins by members of the P. syringae species complex has also been shown to play a relevant role in virulence [27]. Beside cytotoxic phytotoxins like syringomycin and syringopeptin [28\u201330], other phytotoxins like phaseolotoxin, mangotoxin and tabtoxin have been identified within the P. syringae group able to specifically interfere with the plant amino-acid biosynthesis pathways [31\u201334]. Syringolin is another phytotoxin produced by strains of P. syringae that acts as an irreversible proteasome inhibitor and promotes bacterial colonization in the apoplast by inhibiting stomatal closure [35]. Moreover, members of the P. syringae species complex are also able to produce chemical compounds such as auxin, cytokinins and coronatine able to mimic plant hormones and therefore specifically interfere with the regulation of plant immune response [36\u201339].With the advent of affordable next-generation sequencing technologies, hundreds of whole-genome sequence assemblies belonging to P. syringae strains became available in the public databases. Based on this data, many comparative genomic studies have been performed among strains of different pathovars with the aim to define host-specificity related factors [11, 40, 41]. Despite being relevant to investigate host-pathogen co-evolution, such studies are rarely accompanied by a proper host-range determination of the analysed strains and therefore are less suitable for investigations of pathogenicity-related elements.To date, the Prunus genus comprises the group of hosts associated with the major number of different and polyphyletic pathovars and species within the P. syringae species complex if compared to all other known P. syringae host plants. In fact, a total of six pathovars and two independent species distributed throughout PG1, PG2 and PG3 of the P. syringae species complex have been associated with diseases on Prunus spp. [1, 42\u201348]. Distantly related strains are found naturally associated with disease on the same host (or group of hosts), raising the question whether other strains or species within the P. syringae species complex, including strains isolated from non-agricultural habitats, are also potentially pathogenic on Prunus spp. Despite their economic significance, there is a lack of genomic information on members of the P. syringae species complex pathogenic to Prunus spp. that constitutes a real obstacle to an accurate taxonomical definition and generally to a better comprehension of these pathogens.In this study, we generated twelve complete genomes of strains belonging to the main pathovars associated with diseases on cherry trees as well as two draft genomes of the peach quarantine pathogen P. syringae pv. persicae. Together with 39 additional genome sequenced strains isolated from other hosts and from non-agricultural environments, the strains used for genome sequencing in this study were tested in vitro for pathogenicity towards Prunus spp. Based on the pathogenicity tests results, a comparative genomics approach was applied in order to define the sets of known pathogenicity related factors such as T3E and phytotoxins present in pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains.All P. syringae strains used in this study were routinely grown at 28\u2009\u00b0C on lysogenic broth (LB) agar or in LB liquid medium while shaking at 220\u2009rpm. Most of the strains were received from collaborators as stabs or on plates. A total of 21 strains was obtained as freeze-dried samples from culture collections such as CFBP or NCPPB (Table\u00a01) and revived according to the protocol suggested by the culture collection. The identity of strains was confirmed by cts amplification and Sanger-sequencing using the forward primer cts Fp 5\u2032-AGTTGATCATCGAGGGCGCWGCC-3\u2032 and the reverse primer cts Rp 5\u2032-TGATCGGTTTGATCTCGCACGG-3\u2032 published by Sarkar and Guttman [49]. Sequencing was performed at Microsynth AG (Balgach, Switzerland).Genomic DNA for PacBio whole genome sequencing was extracted from the selected strains following the protocol described elsewhere [50]. PacBio library preparation and sequencing were performed at the Functional Genomic Center Zurich. SMRTbells were prepared using the DNA Template Prep Kit 2.0 (3\u2009kb to 10\u2009kb) (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA) and sequencing was performed on a PacBio RSII system (Pacific Biosciences) run with a P4/C2 chemistry using five to six SMRTcells per strain. Reads were assembled on the SMRT analysis software platform version 2.3.0 using the Hierarchical Genome Assembly Process (HGAP3) protocol followed by manual assembly using BLAST or the SeqMan Pro subroutine of the Lasergene Package (DNASTAR, Madison, WI). Genomic DNA for whole genome shotgun sequencing using Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA) was extracted with the NucleoSpin Tissue Kit (Macherey-Nagel AG, D\u00fcren, DE) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The library preparation was then performed on an Illumina NeoPrep System (Illumina) with a TruSeq Nano DNA kit (Illumina) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions with six PCR cycles. Paired-end sequencing of 300\u2009bp was performed using MiSeq Reagent Kit v.3 (Illumina) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Automatic assemblies were performed using SPAdes Genome Assembler v.3.5.0 [51] on a BaseSpace Onsite v.2.1.2 (Illumina). Putative plasmids were identified by the presence of self-closing molecules during assemblies and/or of genes involved in plasmid replication or mobilization.Automatic genome annotation of the sequenced strains was performed using the GenDB platform v.2.4 [52]. The core genome phylogenetic relationships were obtained using EDGAR v.2.2 [53]. Briefly, the core genome was defined by iterative pairwise comparison of the gene content of each of the selected genomes using the bidirectional best hits (BBH) as orthology criterion. For all calculations, protein BLAST (BLASTp) was used with BLOSUM62 as similarity matrix [54, 55]. Genes were considered orthologous when a reciprocal best BLAST hit was found between two genes, and when both BLAST hits were based on alignments exceeding 70% sequence identity spanning over at least 70% of the query gene length [56]. Multiple alignments of each orthologous gene set of the core genome were calculated using the MUSCLE software [57] and non-matching parts of the alignments were removed based on GBLOCKS [58]. The resulting alignments were concatenated and used to construct a Neighbour Joining (NJ) phylogeny as implemented in the PHYLIP package [59]. Non-annotated genomes retrieved from the NCBI database were annotated using a command line annotation pipeline based on HMMer against an EDGAR based database of Pseudomonas ortholog groups followed by reference genome annotation and a comparison to the Swiss-Prot and RefSeq databases for genes that had no high quality hit in previous steps [60]. In addition to the core-genome phylogeny, the average nucleotide identity based on BLASTn (ANIb) values were calculated between each genome using EDGAR v2.2 [60].Pathogenicity tests on immature cherry fruitlets were performed following the protocol described elsewhere [61]. Freshly collected immature sweet cherry fruitlets (cv. Christiana \u00d7 Gisela5) were dipped in 50% ethanol for 3\u2009min and rinsed three times with sterile distilled water. All tested strains (n\u2009=\u200951, Table\u00a01) were grown overnight in liquid LB medium at 28\u2009\u00b0C while shaking at 220\u2009rpm. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with sterile distilled water. Final bacterial concentration was adjusted to OD600\u2009=\u20090.5 (corresponding to around 108\u2009CFU/ml) with sterile distilled water. For each strain, ten fruitlets were inoculated by pricking in two places on the fruitlet with a sterile needle previously immersed in the bacterial suspension. Sterile distilled water was used as negative control. After inoculation, the fruitlets were put on a moist sterile filter paper into a Petri dish, sealed with parafilm and incubated at 22\u2009\u00b0C for four days in the dark. Pathogenicity was assessed visually looking at the symptoms developed at the pricking sites.The detached leaf bioassay was performed as described elsewhere [62] with some slight modifications. Leaves from Prunus persica cv. Red Haven and from Prunus dulcis cv. D\u00fcrkheimer Riesenmandel were freshly collected and washed for 5\u2009min under running tap water, dipped into 70% ethanol for 1\u2009min and then into a 6.5% sodium hypochlorite solution for 5\u2009min. After disinfection, leaves were rinsed three times in sterile distilled water and air-dried under a sterile flow bench. All tested strains (n\u2009=\u200924) were grown overnight in liquid LB medium at 28\u2009\u00b0C while shaking at 220\u2009rpm. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with sterile 0.8% KCl. Final concentration was adjusted to OD600\u2009=\u20090.5 with sterile 0.8% KCl.Leaves were infiltrated from the abaxial leaf side with the bacterial suspension using a sterile disposable 3\u2009ml syringe without needle applying a gentle pressure until the mesophyll tissue became water soaked. Each leaf was infiltrated with eight to ten different strains including the positive and the negative control (i.e. P. syringae pv. syringae strain CFBP 2118 and 0.8% KCl, respectively). Every strain was infiltrated once into three different leaves. Each inoculated leaf was placed into a Petri dish containing water agar (10\u2009g/L) sealed with parafilm and incubated for one week at 25\u2009\u00b0C under daylight photoperiod. A strain causing the formation of a clear brownish necrotic spot on the site of infiltration for all three infiltrated leaves was considered as pathogenic.All growth curves were obtained using the Bioscreen C Microbiology Analyser (Oy Growth Curves AB Ltd., Helsinki, Finland). For this purpose, bacteria were grown overnight in liquid LB medium at 28\u2009\u00b0C while shaking at 220\u2009rpm. Bacterial cells were then collected by centrifugation (10\u2009min at 3220 x g), washed three times with sterile 0.8% KCl and finally diluted to an OD600\u2009=\u20090.01 with LB. Each strain was tested in triplicates.In order to determine the virulence factors profile of the selected strains, the locus tags of the corresponding amino acid sequences were obtained from the NCBI database (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S1) and used as query to screen the remaining genomes for orthologous proteins using EDGAR v2.2 [53]. For the T3E screening, the amino acid sequence of a total of 80 T3E was obtained from the Hop database available at the Pseudomonas syringae Genome Resources website (www.pseudomonas-syringae.org) and used as query in a tBLASTn analysis to retrieve the corresponding locus tags to be used in EDGAR v2.2 [53] to search for the reciprocal best hit on the selected genomes (n\u2009=\u200951) (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S2).De novo assembly of PacBio reads yielded a total of contigs ranging from one to seven with a mean coverage of over 100\u00d7 for each of the genomes (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S3). The size of the chromosome ranged from 5.8\u2009Mb to 6.4\u2009Mb and with an average G\u2009+\u2009C content of 58.6%\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5% for the sequenced chromosomes whereas putative plasmids ranged from 20\u2009kb to 140\u2009kb and generally displayed a lower G\u2009+\u2009C content (~\u200955%) (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S3). Automatic genome annotation predicted a total number of coding sequences (CDS) varying between 5118 and 5995 (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S3). The whole genome sequencing of the P. syringae pv. persicae strain CFBP 1573 using Illumina MiSeq yielded a total of 214 contigs and a mean coverage of 61\u00d7 (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S4). Similar results were obtained for the P. syringae pv. persicae strain NCPPB 2254 with a total 246 contigs and mean coverage of 43\u00d7. Both genomes had a total size of 6.4\u2009Mb and a G\u2009+\u2009C content of 58% (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S4). The number of CDS predicted using GenDB was 6079 and 5990 for strains CFBP 1573 and NCPPB 2254, respectively.In order to investigate a potential link between known virulence-related factors and the observed pattern of pathogenicity, the publicly available genomes of the strains selected for this study (Table\u00a01) were screened for the presence of clusters of genes known to be involved in pathogenicity of P. syringae.All strains possessed a complete hrp/hrc cluster (Fig.\u00a01), with exception of P. viridiflava CFBP 1590, which lacked most of the genes within this cluster. The distribution of the T3SS2 among the strains considered in this study was not consistent with the PG defined based on core-genome phylogeny and even varied among strains of the same pathovar (Fig.\u00a01). Moreover, the presence of the T3SS2 could not explain the pathogenicity profiles obtained in this study (Fig.\u00a01).Again, the presence of known pathogenicity factors was not related to the differences in virulence on cherry, peach and almond. Indeed, most of the analysed genes or gene clusters mainly reflected the core-genome phylogeny and could not reveal why closely related strains differed in their pathogenicity towards the tested hosts.A prerequisite for the development of effective and targeted control measures against plant diseases is the comprehension of the mechanisms adopted by the pathogen for successful host infection.Bacterial canker caused by members of the P. syringae species complex on Prunus spp. is responsible for relevant yield losses in both fruit and wood production worldwide [67, 68]. However, with the exception of few comparative genomics studies of pathogens on Prunus spp. [40, 69, 70] the repertoire of pathogenicity related factors in Prunus spp. associated strains remains largely unstudied. Taking advantage of the complete as well as the draft genomes generated in this study and combining them with a consistent set of publicly available genomes, we generated a whole genome based phylogeny of the P. syringae species complex comprising all known pathovars and species that have ever been associated with diseases in Prunus spp. (status April 2017), including the newly described P. cerasi species [46] and the quarantine peach pathogen P. syringae pv. persicae.The methodology used in this study to test pathogenicity relied on two different in vitro assays, i.e. the use of detached immature fruitlet and detached leaf assays, which were previously shown to be reliable for cherry [61, 62, 70] but also for other woody hosts [70, 71]. While the use of detached organs instead of the whole plant could potentially affect the results of pathogenicity tests, the pattern of pathogenicity retrieved from this study is largely congruent with the patterns obtained from the inoculation of whole plants (C.E. Morris, personal communication), therefore supporting the veracity of the results. Nevertheless, it might be necessary to repeat the pathogenicity tests to further validate the results. Furthermore, the possibility to co-inoculate different strains together with the positive and negative controls was crucial to reduce the potential effect of physiological variation of leaves. The large number of potentially pathogenic stains retrieved from this study and the fact that strains belonging to the same pathovar varied in their pathogenicity towards Prunus spp. highlighted the importance of a proper host range determination in order to perform reasonable comparative genomics studies, especially if intended to investigate factors involved in host-specificity. Indeed, it is important to consider that a strain never isolated from a particular host could still be pathogenic on that host, as also previously shown for the P. syringae-kiwifruit and P. syringae-tomato pathosystems [14, 15]. At the same time, these findings revealed the weakness of the pathovar designation system for P. syringae taxonomy. A clear example is constituted by the two races of P. syringae pv. morsprunorum, whose ANIb values (~\u200988%) are clearly below the species boundaries of 95% [64]. This indicates that they rather should be considered as separate species. Therefore, the genomic data supports the claims to revise the taxonomic position of the P. syringae species complex [72].The results from this study also revealed that strains isolated from water reservoirs such as stream water and snow could potentially constitute a threat for Prunus spp. plantations, supporting the direct link between the agricultural and non-agricultural habitats occupied by P. syringae as already reported [4, 14, 15, 73\u201375]. These findings also provides some important hints for cultural practices implementation especially regarding the maintenance and hygiene of water-irrigation systems. In fact, due to the persistence of potentially pathogenic P. syringae strains in water basins, the use of closed (i.e. recirculating) irrigation systems should be avoided and if possible the water should be disinfected or sterilized prior to use to prevent the spread of this pathogen within plantations [76].A first systematic screen and comparison of known virulence related factors in strains associated with Prunus spp. was performed in this study, revealing a high variability in the set of virulence factors comprising both T3E set as well as phytotoxins and phytohormons production. This observation led to the conclusion that pathogenicity on Prunus spp. may be achieved by different and currently unknown mechanisms that could not be detected in this study as we only used already known virulence related factors. However, the high level of susceptibility observed for this group of hosts to members of the P. syringae species complex could reflect the lack of proper defense mechanisms in the host rather than the evolution of specific virulence strategies in the pathogen. In fact, the results of our comparative genomics approach did not show an obvious match with the results obtained from the pathogenicity tests even though the description of potential link to woody compounds in the past [70]. The only exception was P. viridiflava strain CFBP 1590 where the absence of pathogenicity can be related to the lack of a complete T3SS combined with an extremely reduced T3E repertoire [77, 78].We confirmed that strains possessing a small T3E repertoire were potential producers of necrosis-inducing phytotoxins like syringomycin and/or syringopeptin [40, 65] and belonged mostly to PG2 [65]. In addition, strains of PG9, PG10a and PG10b were found to possess the genes necessary for the production of at least one of those phytotoxins [13]. Nevertheless, only strains of PG2 possessed both syringomycin and syringopeptin clusters, which were previously shown to be physically linked and located on a 155-kb genomic island [79, 80]. The observed mutually exclusive presence of clusters for production of necrosis-inducing phytotoxins versus the evolution of large T3E repertoires reveals a potential trend of pathogenesis subgroup specialization within the P. syringae species complex with strains of the PG2 adopting a more generalist pathogenicity strategy and most of the remaining PGs relying on a specific host-targeted pathogenicity mechanism. This specialization is reflected by the broad vs. narrow host range observed within the P. syringae species complex [81, 82]. In contrast to the T3E, phytotoxins were never recognized by the host resulting in a non-compatible interaction. Therefore, in a specific environment, a pathogenicity mechanism relying on necrosis-inducing phytotoxins would theoretically be selectively more advantageous than the production of specialized T3E, which could lead to the induction of plant immunity [83, 84]. However T3E, phytohormons and other non-necrosis inducing phytotoxins are related to a more precise modulation of the host-physiology [31, 85] and could promote the long-term survival of bacterial populations in the host-plant which can serve as source of inoculum for further infection [86, 87].Nevertheless, syringomycin and syringopeptin were shown to be the major virulence determinant for P. syringae pv. syringae strain B301-D in vitro [88], highlighting the fact that for strains possessing necrosis-inducing phytotoxins, the T3SS/T3E strategy may be of secondary importance. This would also be congruent with the observation that the HrpA protein among PG2 strains is 100% identical suggesting that low diversifying selection acts on that gene in contrast to the HrpA found in PG1 strains [66]. In addition, the HrpA protein is conserved also within strains of PG3, but strains from this PG have a narrower host range when compared to P. syringae pv. syringae strains [45, 47, 89].A positive trend was observed between the necrotic phenotype on cherry immature fruitlets and presence of clusters for the production of syringomycin and syringopeptin [88]. However, while the PG10b strain P. syringae CC1583 was lacking the syringomycin and syringopeptin clusters, it was associated with necrotic lesions in cherry fruitlet tests, suggesting that this strain is probably able to produce another necrosis inducing phytotoxin, which is still not characterized. Although strains within PG2 usually possessed a smaller set of T3E (~\u200915), both P. cerasi strains constituted an exception having almost the double of T3E. As we obtained high quality genomes for those strains, it was possible to determine that around half of those T3E were located on plasmids (Fig.\u00a03) thereby highlighting the importance of horizontal gene transfer in P. syringae [82, 90].Strains of the quarantine peach pathogen P. syringae pv. persicae are known to produce a necrosis inducing phytotoxin called persicomycin [91]. However, no necrotic phenotype was observed on cherry fruitlets inoculated with P. syringae pv. persicae NCPPB 2254. As persicomycin production was shown to be thermoregulated [91] it is possible that it was not induced under the used assay conditions. Moreover P. syringae pv. persicae NCPPB 2254 was never tested previously for production of persicomycin. On the other hand, the P. syringae pv. persicae pathotype strain CFBP 1573 which was shown to produce persicomycin under in vitro conditions [91] did not cause necrotic lesions on cherry immature fruitlets as well (M. Ka\u0142u\u017ana, personal communication), leaving the role of this phytotoxin in pathogenicity open.The positive trend between the reduced growth rate in rich medium and the pathogenicity led to the hypothesis that the inability of the identified P. syringae strains to cause disease was rather related to a metabolic impairment of those strains which does not allow them to reach population densities able to trigger disease [86]. The T3E screening revealed that all strains that resulted in a non-pathogenic phenotype on all three hosts were lacking a single T3E, namely HopAA, which has been shown to contribute to efficient formation of bacterial colonies in planta [92]. However, as P. syringae pv. phaseolicola strain 1448a is lacking this T3E as well, but was still growing at a higher growth rate and was pathogenic to cherry, peach and almond, this hypothesis can be rejected. Comparative genomics between closely related pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains revealed mutations within genes of metabolic pathways previously shown to be involved in virulence of plant pathogenic bacteria [93\u201397]. However, the role of those pathways in the pathogenicity of Prunus spp. is still unclear.Based on the obtained results, it is clear that the ability of P. syringae strains to cause disease on Prunus spp. is not the result of a common evolutionary event but is most probably due to an independent loss or gain of different factors in individual strains, not necessarily related to virulence. Moreover, the large number of strains found to be pathogenic on the tested hosts revealed that the Prunus spp. \u2013 P. syringae pathosystem does not represent the most suitable case for the investigation of virulence-related factors. A more comprehensive phenotyping and genome comparisons of both pathogen and host would provide more indications in order to reveal key factors in the pathogenicity of P. syringae on cherry, peach and almond.Average nucleotide identity based on BLASTN searchesCoding sequencesIndole acetic acidMultilocus sequence analysisOptical densityPhylogroupPathovarType III effectorsType III secretion systemFunding was provided by the Swiss Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SBFI C12.0099) within the European research network COST Action FA1104 \u2018Sustainable production of high-quality cherries for the European market\u2019 and in part by the European Union Seventh Framework (FP7/2007\u20132013) under the grant agreement no. 613678 (DROPSA).

For comparative genomics purpose, the whole genome data obtained in this study were combined with the publicly available genome data of 39 additional strains from the P. syringae species complex including strains isolated from Prunus spp. (n\u2009=\u20093), other woody plants (n\u2009=\u200916), herbaceous plants (n\u2009=\u200913) as well as strains isolated from non-agricultural environments (n\u2009=\u20097) and were covering nine of the thirteen PGs defined by Berge et al. [13]. The 39 additional strains were selected based on 1) their availability for testing in the laboratory, 2) having a genome with less than 1000 contigs, and 3) a set of diverse hosts and PG were covered.Table 1\nList of strains used in this study\n\nN.A. not available\naSuperscript following strain names indicate T the type strain of a species and P the pathotype strain for a pathovar.

The obtained tree was generated based on the concatenated and aligned amino acid sequences of 2085 proteins consisting of a total length of 840,202 amino acids (Fig.\u00a01). The main clustering obtained from the core genome phylogeny reflected the PGs previously defined by Multi Locus Sequence Analysis (MLSA) [11, 49, 63] and single locus phylogeny [12, 13]. The sequenced Prunus associated strains fell into three different PGs namely PG1 (P. syringae pv. morsprunorum race 2, P. syringae pv. avii, P. syringae pv. persicae), PG2 (P. syringae pv. syringae and P. cerasi) and PG3 (P. syringae pv. morsprunorum race 1 and P. syringae pv. cerasicola). However, strains of different Prunus associated pathovars from the same PG did not form a monophyletic group (Fig.\u00a01). Within PG1, Prunus associated strains were found in two separate clades: one with strains of the P. syringae pv. morsprunorum race 2 (PG1b) and one with P. syringae pv. persicae and P. syringae pv. avii (PG1a). Strains of P. syringae pv. syringae and P. cerasi were both belonging to the PG2 but clustered within PG2d and PG2a, respectively (Fig.\u00a01). Sequenced strains of the same pathovar mostly tightly clustered with exception of the two P. syringae pv. syringae strains CFBP 2118 and CFBP 4215 which clustered closer to strains isolated from other hosts than to each other. The core-genome phylogeny was supported by ANIb results which revealed additionally that PGs boundaries within the P. syringae species complex, with ANIb values <\u200995%, actually represent species boundaries [64] (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figure S1).\n\nFig. 1\nPathogenicity tests results and virulence factors profile of the analyzed Pseudomonas syringae strains. Strains sequenced in this study are indicated in bold. Strains are ordered based on the core-genome. Approximately Maximum-Likelihood phylogenetic tree constructed on the similarity of 2085 protein sequences corresponding to a total alignment length of 840,202 amino acids per genome. The local support values computed using the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test are indicated close to the nodes. The tree was generated using EDGAR v.2.2 [53]. The strain names refer to the code field from Table\u00a01. Phylogroups (PGs) are reported on the left and are separated by horizontal dashed lines whereas clades are reported on the right and are separated by horizontal dotted lines. Results of the pathogenicity tests performed on immature cherry fruitlets, peach and almond detached leaves are reported in the first three columns (see graphical legend). No pathogenicity test was performed for strains displaying a X sign in a white square. A strain was defined as possessing T3SS2, a second cluster encoding for a type III 3 secretion system (T3SS) homologous to the one found in rhizobia, if at least 22 out of the 27 genes constituting this system were retrieved. Presence (black) and absence (white) of clusters for biosynthesis and regulations of the known phytohormones (pink) and phytotoxins (blue) is also reported. The generation time in hours was derived from the slope of the logarithmic (log10) growth curve. IaaM (tryptophan monooxygenase) and IaaH (indoleacetamide hydrolase) are responsible for the synthesis of auxin whereas IaaL (indole-acetic acid-lysine synthase) is conjugating auxin to lysine decreasing the concentration of the active form of auxin. Locus tags used for the genotypic screening are reported in Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Tables S1 and S2. N.D.: not determined\nResults of the cherry immature fruitlets revealed a high pathogenicity potential towards Prunus spp. within the P. syringae species complex. In particular, of the 51 strains tested on immature cherry fruitlets, 32 strains were pathogenic, ten were classified as non-pathogenic whereas nine strains were associated with unclear phenotypes, i.e. neither necrotic nor water soaked (Fig.\u00a01). Most of the pathogenic strains (n\u2009=\u200923) caused brownish, water-soaked superficial lesions similar to those caused by P. syringae pv. morsprunorum race 1 and race 2 whereas the remaining strains (n\u2009=\u20099) caused formation of black-brown sunken necrotic lesions which are typically caused by P. syringae pv. syringae (Fig.\u00a02A). Most of the non-pathogenic strains belonged to PG1 (n\u2009=\u20095) and PG3 (n\u2009=\u20094) and included six strains originally isolated from Prunus spp. like the peach pathogen P. syringae pv. persicae NCPPB 2254 and the P. syringae pv. morsprunorum race 2 pathotype strain M302280 (Fig.\u00a01). Results obtained from the detached leaf assays (Fig.\u00a02B) on peach and almond were mostly congruent with the virulence profile obtained from the cherry immature fruitlets inoculation but additionally revealed few strains possessing a narrower host range. In fact, P. syringae pv. persicae NCPPB 2254 and P. syringae pv. actinidifoliorum ICMP 18883 were both non-pathogenic on cherry fruitlets but were clearly pathogenic if inoculated on peach and almond leaves. Additionally, P. cerasi PL58 was non-pathogenic on peach leaves but showed symptoms on cherry immature fruitlets and almond leaves as well (Fig.\u00a01). Furthermore, the P. avellanae strain PaVt10 was not pathogenic on cherry fruitlets and peach leaves but was symptomatic on almond leaves. Only five strains resulted to be non-pathogenic in all three in vitro pathogenicity tests, namely P. syringae pv. morsprunorum race 2 strain M302280 (PG1), P. amygdali pv. dendropanacis CFBP 3226 (PG3), P. amygdali CFBP 3205 (PG3) and both P. syringae pv. cerasicola strains CFBP 6109 and CFBP 6110 (PG3).\n\nFig. 2\nRepresentative results of the pathogenicity tests on cherry immature fruitlets (A) and on peach detached leaf (B). (A) Typical symptoms observed two days post inoculation with suspensions of (A1) Pseudomonas syringae pv. morsprunorum race 2 CFBP 2116, (A2) P. syringae pv. syringae CFBP 2118 and (A3) with sterile distilled water.

The overall T3E presence/absence distribution profile mostly reflected the core-genome phylogeny: closely related strains possessed similar T3E repertoires with some rearrangements. Also here, the T3E profiles could not explain the pathogenicity results. It was noticed that the T3E HopAA, which is located in the conserved effector locus (CEL) was absent in the genomes of the five strains that were non-pathogenic on cherry, peach and almond. However, HopAA was also missing in the genomes of P. syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448a and in P. syringae pv. aesculi 0893_23, which, in contrast, were pathogenic. As already noticed by Lindeberg et al. [65], the number of T3E present in strains from the PG2 is generally lower in comparison to strains of PG1 or PG3 (Fig.\u00a03). However, both P. cerasi strains, belonging to PG2a, possessed almost the double number of T3E when compared to all other members of the PG2 while most of the T3E in P. cerasi were located on plasmids (Fig.\u00a03). On the other hand, the presence of clusters for the synthesis of the necrosis-inducing phytotoxins syringomycin and syringopeptin co-occurred with the phenotype obtained from the immature cherry fruitlets assay: with exception of P. syringae CC1583 (PG10b), the strains causing necrotic lesions (Fig.\u00a01) possessed clusters related to the production and regulation of syringomycin, syringopeptin or both. These clusters were generally found in strains of PG2, which were also shown to possess a lower amount of T3E (~\u200920 T3E per strain). However, P. syringae strain CC1557, belonging to the quite distantly related PG10a, also possessed the syringomycin cluster. The syringolin cluster was exclusively found in strains from the PG2 and mostly within the PG2d clade whereas the phaseolotoxin cluster was only present in P. syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448a (PG3) and two strains of P. syringae pv. actinidiae (PG1). The mangotoxin cluster was restricted to strains from the PG2 and specifically found within the clades PG2a and PG2b (Fig.\u00a01). The genes involved in the synthesis of the plant hormone auxin (indoleacetic acid, IAA), iaaM and iaaH, encoding respectively the tryptophane monooxygenase and IAA hydrolase were found in strains belonging to PG2d and PG3, but as well as in some strains within PG1 (n\u2009=\u20093). In contrast, the iaaL gene encoding the IAA-lysine synthase responsible for the reversible inactivation of IAA was found throughout the entire phylogenetic tree. The cluster for the biosynthesis of coronatine was found only in six distantly related strains whereas only three closely related strains within PG3 were potentially able to produce cytokinins.\n\nFig. 3\nType III effector (T3E) profile of the 52 Pseudomonas syringae strains used in this study. Strains sequenced in this study are indicated in bold. The amino acid sequence of a total of 80 T3E (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S2) was obtained from the Hop database available at the P. syringae Genome Resources website (www.pseudomonas-syringae.org) and used as query in a tBLASTn analysis to retrieve the corresponding locus tags to be used in EDGAR v.2.2 [53] for search of the reciprocal best hit on the selected genomes. Black squares indicate presence whereas white squares indicate absence of the T3E. For strains sequenced in this study using PacBio RSII as well as for the complete genomes P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 and P. syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448a, grey squared indicates T3E located on plasmids. Strains are ordered based on the core-genome phylogeny constructed in Fig.\u00a01 together with phenotypical analysis whereas T3E are ordered based on their abundance from left to right in descending order. The strain names refer to the code field from Table\u00a01. Phylogroups are reported on the left and are separated by horizontal dashed lines whereas clades are reported on the right and are separated by horizontal dotted lines. The last column indicates the total number of T3E per strain. CEL: the T3E located in the conserved effector locus\nThe hrpA gene within the hrp/hrc cluster encodes for the extracellular pilus of the T3SS, which is essential for a functional T3SS and has been shown to be under diversifying selection [66]. Two homologous HrpA proteins were found within the P. syringae species complex: one variant was found in strains of PG1, PG6, PG9 and PG10 and named HrpA1 (for HrpA like PG1) whereas the other variant was present in strains belonging to PG2, PG3 and PG5 and named HrpA2 (for HrpA like PG2) (Fig.\u00a04). The pattern of distribution of these two HrpA variants did not reflect the core genome phylogeny. In fact, the genome of PG6 strain P. syringae pv. tagetis ICMP 4091 contained the HrpA1 variant gene, but the strain was phylogenetically positioned equidistantly to PG2 and PG3 strains, which both have the HrpA2 variant. The same situation was observed for the PG5 strain P. cannabina pv. alisalensis ES4326 (Fig.\u00a01). The sequence analysis of HrpA1 revealed a higher level of polymorphism within strains of the same PG if compared to HrpA2 (Fig.\u00a04). Polymorphisms of HrpA1 and HrpA2 mostly reflected the PGs but HrpA1 within strains of the PG1 displayed some more specific polymorphisms, which were generally shared among strains of the same pathovar. However, the HrpA1 protein from P. syringae pv. tomato NCPPB 1108 (PG1a) was identical to the HrpA1 protein of strains belonging to PG1b including strains isolated from water and snow (Fig.\u00a04). Strains of the PG2 possessed a 100% identical HrpA2 protein and within PG3, the HrpA2 sequence was almost identical independent of the pathovar (Fig.\u00a04).\n\nFig. 4\nAlignment of the HrpA1 and HrpA2 proteins retrieved from the 51 genomes of members of the Pseudomonas syringae species complex analyses in this study. Red lines indicate the phylogroup (PG) borders, whereas red dashed lines indicate clade borders. Amino acids are only reported if different from the reference sequences (GenBank Accession no. AKT31917 and CFBP2118_03968, respectively) which are entirely displayed in the top line of each alignment\nThe results obtained from the comparative genomics of known virulence related factors did not reveal any direct link with the results obtained from the pathogenicity tests. However, it was noticed that non-pathogenic strains usually grew at a lower growth rate in rich medium (LB) if compared to their closely related pathogenic strains (Fig.\u00a01). For example, the non-pathogenic strain P. syringae pv. morsprunorum race 2\u2009M302280 displayed a generation time of 100\u2009min which is three times higher than what was observed for the two pathogenic P. syringae pv. morsprunorum race 2 strains analysed in this study. The same trend was observed with the pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of the PG3 (Fig.\u00a01). This suggested that a metabolic impairment could be a potential reason why those strains were not pathogenic within the timeframe of the experiments. Comparative genomics between closely related pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains revealed some mutations affecting genes involved in metabolic pathways in non-pathogenic strains, which were previously shown to be related to virulence of plant pathogenic bacteria (Table\u00a02).Table 2\nList of inactivated nutrient assimilation genes in the identified non-pathogenic Pseudomonas syringae strains\n\n\u201c+\u201d: same as Pmp 2 CFBP 3800\n\n\nAdditional file 1:\nThis file contains all supplementary tables and figures listed below.

(PDF 1680 kb)", "s12864-019-5553-0": "Altered epigenetic profiles are a feature of intestinal diseases, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease. DNA methylation studies in these diseases have utilised intestinal mucosal tissue or blood which can be difficult to collect, particularly for large-scale research studies. Saliva is an attractive alternative for epigenetic studies as it is easy to collect and provides high quality methylation profiles. The aim of the study was to determine the utility of saliva as an alternative for DNA methylation studies of intestinal disorders.DNA methylation in saliva and intestinal mucosa samples were compared in individuals (n\u00a0=\u200910) undergoing endoscopies using the Illumina Infinium Methylation 450\u2009K Beadchip array. We found that DNA methylation was correlated between tissue types within an individual (Pearson correlation co-efficient r\u2009=\u20090.92 to 0.95, p\u00a0<\u20090.001). Of the 48,541 probes (approximately 11% of CpG sites) that were differentially methylated between saliva and intestinal mucosa (adjusted p\u2009<\u20090.001, |\u0394\u03b2|\u2009\u2265\u200920%), these mapped to genes involved in tissue-specific pathways, including the apelin signalling and oxytocin pathways which are important in gastrointestinal cytoprotection and motility.This study suggests that saliva has the potential to be used as an alternate DNA source to invasive intestinal mucosa for DNA methylation research into intestinal conditions.Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, coeliac disease, and irritable bowel disease are chronic intestinal inflammatory disorders characterised by varying intestinal symptoms including; severe diarrhoea, abdominal pain and rectal bleeding; as well as extra-intestinal complications including anaemia and malnutrition [1]. The development of these conditions is thought to be a result of a genetic predisposition coupled with environmental stimuli [2]. The involvement of both genetic and environmental factors suggests that epigenetic mechanisms have a role in the pathogenesis of these intestinal inflammatory diseases [3]. Epigenetic modifications are defined as stable and heritable alterations in gene expression and function that do not alter the DNA sequence [4]. DNA methylation is a type of epigenetic modification which regulates gene transcription and has roles in development, differentiation, and genomic stability [5]. It involves the addition of a methyl group to a cytosine nucleotide when it is followed by a guanine which are referred to as CpG dinucleotides. In the mammalian genome approximately 15% of the CpG dinucleotides are found in CpG islands, which are defined as stretches of DNA >\u2009200\u2009bp, with a CG content greater than 50% and an observed to expected ratio of CpG greater than 60% [6, 7]. CpG islands are often found in the promoter regions of both constitutively expressed genes and tissue specific genes [8]. Methylation of CpG islands are generally associated with gene repression.Epigenetic modifications can be influenced by environmental factors including diet, illness and smoking [9]. DNA methylation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammatory diseases, with studies in Crohn\u2019s disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and ulcerative colitis demonstrating that individuals with these conditions have altered DNA methylation profiles in their intestinal, colon, or rectal tissue, when compared to healthy controls [2, 10, 11].Many studies have investigated the utility of DNA methylation biomarkers for disease screening, diagnosis, and management [12, 13]. Epigenetic studies in inflammatory intestinal diseases have utilised either intestinal mucosal tissue or peripheral blood mononuclear cells [14, 15]. Collection of these samples is invasive, carries the risk of complications, and requires trained personnel, which for large-scale research studies can be problematic. Saliva is an attractive alternative for epigenetic studies as it is easy to collect and provides high quality methylation profiles [16]. In the clinical setting, saliva is also an attractive alternative compared to blood or intestinal mucosa, as individuals can collect their own saliva using commercially available kits which stabilises the sample at room temperature, enabling individuals to mail the sample back to the clinic. This negates the need for specially trained medical personnel and reduces the risk of disease transmission via needle stick injury [17]. Furthermore, the convenience of this method may also increase compliance rates for follow up medical appointments and procedures [16]. Studies examining the suitability of saliva as a source of DNA for epigenetic and genetic research have shown that saliva yields DNA of sufficient quantity and quality for downstream applications [18].DNA methylation studies comparing profiles between tissue types within individuals have shown that regions of tissue-specific differential methylation mainly map to CpG poor regions [19]. The viability of saliva as an alternative for less accessible tissues; including brain [20], lung/bronchial epithelium [21], and peripheral blood mononuclear cells [16], for DNA methylation studies has been previously demonstrated, with methylation profiles correlating positively between saliva and the tissue in question. Saliva is composed of more than 99% water, and also contains white blood cells and epithelial cells, which represent the cell types of the oral mucosa [22]. The oral cavity is connected to and represents the entrance to the gastrointestinal tract. For studies where environmental exposures can drive epigenetic change, saliva and the oral mucosa is an ideal alternative for the intestinal mucosa given the similarities in cellular composition and environmental exposures between the two tissue sites.To date, no studies have compared DNA methylation profiles between saliva and the intestinal mucosa. The aim of the current study was to determine the utility of saliva for large scale DNA methylation research studies in intestinal conditions by investigating tissue-specific methylation differences.The present study compared DNA methylation profiles between saliva and intestinal mucosa within an individual, to determine the feasibility of saliva as an alternative for intestinal mucosal tissue for DNA methylation research studies in intestinal conditions. We found that methylation profiles were highly correlated between saliva and intestinal mucosa (r 0.92\u20130.95) within an individual. This indicates that saliva has the potential to be a viable alternative for intestinal tissue for future DNA methylation studies.Saliva is an attractive alternative for DNA methylation profiling as collection is simple, non-invasive, and high quality methylation profiles can be generated [16, 18]. For participant recruitment in large research studies, these factors are highly beneficial for increasing participation as seen in a study comparing participation between blood collection (31% positive) and saliva collection (72% positive) [23]. This could be extended to a clinical setting where the potential use of saliva to help screen and monitor conditions, may improve compliance rates for patient follow up appointments.The feasibility of using oral mucosa as a potential alternative for a less accessible tissue has been previously investigated. Methylation profiles comparing buccal epithelial swabs and bronchial epithelium obtained from individuals with adenocarcinoma lung cancers who smoke tobacco, to assess the utility of saliva for screening and diagnosing lung cancer found the methylation profiles of two genes involved in early lung carcinogenesis, p16 and FHIT, correlated strongly between saliva and bronchial samples [21]. It was suggested that since the entire airway from oral cavity to lungs is exposed to the carcinogens from tobacco, the carcinogens would be able to induce similar epigenetic alterations in the oral mucosa as well as in the distant lung tissue. This study was the first to suggest that an environmental agent could induce the same epigenetic changes in the oral mucosa as it does in a distant tissue, prompting the suggestion that oral mucosa could be used as a surrogate tissue in early screening interventions for preventing lung cancer [21]. In respiratory allergy, comparisons between peripheral blood mononuclear cells and saliva found that 96% of CpG sites were comparable between peripheral blood mononuclear cells and saliva [16]. Further comparisons between saliva and blood in a population of African Americans recruited at urban public hospitals found 88.6% of CpG sites were comparable. This study also found that DNA methylation profiles between saliva and brain tissues were more similar than methylation profiles between saliva and blood [20].The oral cavity is the entrance to the gastrointestinal tract. The gastrointestinal tract is a muscular tube lined by a mucous membrane with similar histological organization across its segments; the oral cavity, stomach, small intestine and large intestine. Oral mucosa consists of two layers, the surface stratified squamous epithelium and the deeper lamina propria. Duodenal mucosa consists of three layers, columnar epithelium with absorptive capacity including villi, lamina propria and a deep submucosa lined with Brunner\u2019s glands which secrete mucus and bicarbonate in order to neutralise stomach acids and is responsible for the enzymatic breakdown of food. Enzymes found in saliva are also essential in the breakdown of dietary starches and fats. The similar composition and function of mucosa between the oral mucosa and intestinal mucosa alongside our findings of comparable methylation profiles between saliva and intestinal mucosa strengthens the idea that saliva has the potential to be used as an alternative for more invasive tissues.When comparing tissue types within an individual, a proportion of CpG sites will be differentially methylated, due to tissue-specific functions, which can be seen in Additional\u00a0file\u00a05: Figure S3. Studies comparing methylation profiles between tissue types within individuals have identified tissue-specific differentially methylated regions (tDMRs) using the criterion absolute methylation differences >\u200920% and p-value <\u20090.001 [16, 19, 24, 25]. Methylation comparisons between 17 different human somatic tissues, including gastric mucosa found that 2.2% of hypermethylated and 14.9% of hypomethylated CpG sites were commonly seen across all 17 tissue types. Comparisons between a specific tissue type and all other tissue types identified 14,441 tDMRs. Functional analysis of the tDMR found the genes that were hypomethylated in certain tissues were frequently associated with tissue-specific functions, while none of the hypermethylated genes were found to be involved in tissue-specific functions, indicating that hypomethylation is associated with tissue-specific functions [24].In the present study, 292 tDMR were identified between intestinal mucosa and saliva which corresponded to 278 unique genes. Pathway analysis of these genes identified apelin signalling pathways as being significantly enriched. Apelin is an important gut regulatory peptide ligand of the APJ receptor which has a role in gastrointestinal cytoprotection by regulating apoptosis [26, 27]. The oxytocin signalling pathway was also significantly enriched. Oxytocin has been suggested to contribute to the control of the gastrointestinal motility, as it is expressed in nerve fibres along the entire human gastrointestinal tract, [28]. The differences in methylation profiles observed are expected when comparing between two different tissue types.Samples were collected from individuals who were undergoing investigations for upper gastrointestinal related issues. Comparisons of methylation profiles were made within individuals which likely minimised any effect of the different gastric issues on the methylation profiles. Many upper gastric issues, for example gastro-oesophageal reflux affect both the upper gastric region and the oral cavity. Despite the main damage occurring to the lower oesophagus, oral manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux can include a burning mouth sensation, tongue sensitivity, itching/burning, tooth erosion, dentinal hypersensitivity and temporomandibular/myofascial pain dysfunction [29, 30]. Similarly, in coeliac disease where the typical symptoms are observed in the abdominal region, the disease may manifest in the oral cavity as oral ulcerations, changes in the salivary and parotid glands, and changes in the tongue [31].The gut microbiome can effect DNA methylation profiles via the production of metabolites, which alters the pool of compounds used in epigenetics modifications, or through inhibiting enzymes involved in epigenetic pathways [32]. The differences in methylation profiles observed may be due to differences in the microbiota of these two tissues. Further investigations would be needed to assess if there are differences in the microbiome profiles between the oral and intestinal microbiota and if these are causing the differences observed in the methylation profiles.In addition to the clustering of saliva and intestinal tissue into two distinct groups, saliva samples also clustered into two distinct groups. These two clusters appear to be the individuals with coeliac disease and individuals being investigated for other gastrointestinal disorders. All individuals with coeliac disease were currently on a strict gluten-free diet. Diet has been shown to modify microbiota populations as well as methylation profiles [33\u201335]. Differences in microbial populations due to diet, or the presence of coeliac disease, could account for the clustering observed. Further investigations comparing DNA methylation profiles from saliva samples between coeliac and non-coeliac individuals in a larger dataset would be of interest. Furthermore, the post normalisation MDS plots (Additional file 2: Figure S1C) shows tight clustering of intestinal samples but greater variations in saliva sample. This suggests that saliva is a potentially more informative tissue compared to intestinal mucosa with regard to DNA methylation due to the ability to detect differences between disease groups.Half of our participants were former smokers, while smoking can have long-lasting effects on DNA methylation patterns, it has been shown that individuals who quit smoking have DNA methylation profiles similar to those of non-smokers [36]. It has been suggested however that environmental agents can induce the same epigenetic changes in the oral mucosa as it does in distant tissue [21]. Therefore, any methylation changes caused by past smoking in the oral mucosa could occur in the gut as well. Comparisons were conducted within an individual to account for the effects of past smoking on DNA methylation profiles.The results from this study provide a framework for the use of saliva in DNA methylation research studies in intestinal conditions. It suggests that saliva has the potential to be used as an alternative for intestinal mucosa which would be beneficial to epigenetic research in inflammatory intestinal conditions by negating the need for invasive tissue collection. Overall, positive correlations in global DNA methylation were observed between saliva and intestinal mucosa tissues. The presence of inter-individual variation in saliva, particularly the clustering of individuals with coeliac disease compared to non-coeliac disease individuals, is of particular interest for research studies that aim to identify epigenetic risk factors that are associated with disease. Further studies investigating the influence of a gluten-free diet on salivary DNA methylation profiles would be of interest.Individuals undergoing an endoscopy to investigate non-cancer related epigastric symptoms at Campbelltown Private Hospital, NSW, Australia were recruited into this study. This study was approved by the Western Sydney University Human Ethics Committee (H10513), the South Western Sydney Local Health District Ethics Committee (HREC/16/LPOOL/305) and the Macquarie University Human Ethics Committee (5201700199). Following written informed consent, demographic, clinical, and lifestyle information was collected via questionnaire [37]. Saliva samples were collected immediately prior to the patient\u2019s endoscopy using the Oragene-DNA OG500 saliva self-collection kit (DNA Genotex, Canada), and stored at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Intestinal biopsy samples were collected by the gastroenterologist during an upper gastric endoscopy procedure, while the participant was under sedation. Biopsies were excised from the duodenal region of the gastrointestinal tract and stored at \u2212\u200980\u2009\u00b0C.Genomic DNA was extracted from intestinal mucosal tissue using the Qiagen DNA Mini Kit Tissue Spin Column Protocol (Qiagen, Germany). Saliva was incubated at 50\u2009\u00b0C for 2\u2009h followed by incubation with proteinase K at 56\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. Saliva samples were processed using the prepIT-L2P DNA collection kit (DNA Genotek, Canada) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Saliva DNA was then purified using the Qiagen DNA mini kit spin column protocol (Qiagen, Germany). All extracted samples were quantified and stored at \u2212\u200920\u2009\u00b0C.Genomic DNA underwent sodium bisulfite conversion and was hybridized to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Amplification, hybridization, washing, labelling and scanning of the array was performed by the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF), a fee-for-service provider. Raw IDAT files containing signal intensities for each probe were extracted using Illumina GenomeStudio software and imported into RStudio using the methylumi and minfi packages [38, 39]. Data quality control and processing steps were conducted using the methylumi and wateRmelon packages in R [38, 40]. Filtering by detection p-values removed both failed samples and probes. The pfilter function was used to discard probes with a detection p-value >\u20090.01 in at least 1% samples (n\u00a0=\u20091011) and/or a bead count less than 3 in 5% of samples (n\u00a0=\u2009240). No samples were removed. Data was normalised by adjusting for background methylated and unmethylated intensities with the dasen function [40]. Multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) plots of variably methylated probes in saliva and intestinal mucosa were used to confirm that the predicted tissue type matched the reported tissue type for each participant pre and post normalisation (Additional file 2: Figure S1).Methylation measurements of a subset of probes on the microarray can be confounded by underlying SNPs and cross-hybridisation to other areas of the genome. To account for this, probes containing a SNP with minor allele frequency (MAF)\u2009>\u20095% within 5\u2009bp of the single base extension site were removed from all analyses based on the SNP annotation data provided by Illumina, the Bioconductor package minfi [39], and Chen and colleagues [41]. Probes located on sex chromosomes (X chromosome n\u00a0=\u200911,141 and Y chromosome n\u00a0=\u2009416), and non-cpg probes (n\u00a0=\u20093073) were also removed from subsequent analysis, leaving 456,148 probes. Hierarchical clustering was performed using average linkage and correlation-based distances metric for clustering. Saliva contains a mixture of different cell types, and cell-type proportions may differ across individuals [42]. Surrogate variable analysis using the sva package was used to identify sources of variation, including cell type heterogeneity within samples and potential batch effects [43, 44]. sva using the \u201cleek\u201d method identified two surrogate variables that were then adjusted for in subsequent analysis.Moderated paired t-tests were used to assess the association between methylation and tissue type at the individual probe level using the limma package [45]. Prior to analysis, \u03b2-values were log transformed to M-values to improve sensitivity. P-values were adjusted for multiple testing according to the false discovery rate (FDR) procedure of Benjamini Hochberg. Significantly differentially methylated probes (DMPs) were selected using an absolute \u03b2 difference of \u226520% and an adjusted p\u00a0<\u20090.001 cut-off. While DNA methylation studies can report effect sizes as small as 5% [15], a more stringent definition of absolute beta difference of 20% was used as we would expect larger differences between tissue types. Furthermore, these cut-offs are in line with previous studies comparing DNA methylation between tissues [16, 19, 24, 25]. The DMRcate package [46] was then used to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs), based on consecutive CpG probes with a mean methylation difference above a certain threshold. The inclusion threshold was set to beta difference\u2009\u2265\u200920%, and at least two consecutive CpGs to minimise the probability of randomly obtaining consecutive CpGs whose mean effect size are above 20%. Correlations between methylation in saliva and intestinal mucosa were measured using the cor.test function, at each probe site between paired samples, using Pearson\u2019s product moment correlation coefficient. A Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value <\u20090.05 was considered as significant.Functional annotation analysis and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed using the missMethyl package [47]. The gometh function (prior.prob.\u2009=\u2009TRUE) was used to test gene ontology enrichment for significant CpGs. In addition, the gometh function was used to perform pathway enrichment analysis based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) classification databases to identify significant pathways. Following this, the topGO or topKEGG function of the limma package was used to identify the most significant GO terms and KEGG pathways.Differentially methylated probeDifferentially methylated regionFalse discovery rateGene ontologyMinor allele frequencyTissue-specific differentially methylated regionNo sources of funding are declared by the authors.The dataset(s) supporting the conclusions of this article is(are) available in the NCBI\u2019s Gene Expression Ombnibus repository [48], and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE118260 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE118260).This study was approved by the Western Sydney University Human Ethics Committee (H10513) and the Macquarie University Human Ethics Committee (5201700199).

All individuals were female, Caucasian, and were not current smokers. The mean age was 51.6\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1\u2009years old, and the mean BMI was 28.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8\u2009kg/m2. Individuals were undergoing endoscopies for investigations into epigastric pain and difficulty swallowing or were having routine follow up endoscopies for coeliac disease. All individuals with coeliac disease were currently on a gluten-free diet and did not have active disease. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants are summarised in Table\u00a01.Table 1\nClinical and demographical characteristics of individuals\nDNA methylation was measured using Illumina Infinium Methylation 450\u2009K Beadchip array for all 20 samples (10 saliva and 10 matched intestinal samples). Following quality control filtering and removal of probes on sex chromosomes and probes on non-cpg sites, 456,148 probes were included in the analysis. Hierarchical clustering based on average linkage and correlation-based distances showed that the saliva and intestinal tissue samples clustered into two distinct groups, and within the saliva cluster, individuals with coeliac disease also appear to cluster together (Fig.\u00a01a). Similar patterns were observed following separation of significant and non-significant probes (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figure S2). Multidimensional scaling (MDS) of the top 1000 most variable sites showed intestinal mucosal tissue clustered tightly, while saliva samples were more variable (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Figure S1C). Overall, global DNA methylation of saliva and intestinal mucosa was positively correlated within an individual (Pearson\u2019s correlation co-efficient r 0.92\u20130.95, p\u00a0<\u20090.001) (Table\u00a02). For 68.9% of CpG sites positive Pearson correlations between methylation levels of saliva and tissue samples were observed, and of these 14.8% were statistically significant (Fig. 1b). A scatter plot of average DNA methylation values for 4000 random CpG sites indicates methylation is in the same direction in saliva versus intestinal mucosal tissue samples, r\u2009=\u20090.94 (Fig.\u00a02). The distribution of difference in DNA methylation (|\u0394\u03b2|) between saliva and tissue samples is shown in Fig. 1c. Using the filtering criterion of adjusted p\u2009<\u00a00.001, |\u0394\u03b2| \u226520%, 48,541 probes were identified as being differentially methylated, of which 20,152 (41.5%) were hypomethylated and 28,389 (58.5%) hypermethylated in saliva vs intestinal mucosa (Additional\u00a0file\u00a03: Table S1). Using both an effect size and the P value cut-off (adjusted p\u00a0<\u20090.001, mean |\u0394\u03b2| \u226520%), region analysis identified 292 tissue-specific regions (tDMR), 21 (7.2%) hypomethylated and 271 (92.8%) hypermethylated regions between saliva and intestinal mucosa, which mapped to 278 annotated genes (Additional\u00a0file\u00a04: Table S2).\n\nFig. 1\nData clustering and comparison between saliva and tissue DNA methylation profiles. a) Hierarchical clustering based on correlation distances of methylation profiles in 20 samples \u2013 intestinal mucosa and saliva samples from 10 individuals; b) Pearson correlation coefficients for methylation levels of saliva vs tissue for each of the CpG sites (positive correlations in boxed area with statistically significant correlations (adjusted P\u00a0<\u20090.05) shown in red bars); c) The distribution of cg-probes plotted against the difference in methylation expressed as \u0394\u03b2-values\nTable 2\nCorrelation of average DNA methylation across all CpG sites between saliva and intestinal mucosa within an individual\n\n\nFig. 2\nScatter plot of average DNA methylation beta values for 4000 random CpG sites between intestinal and saliva samples.

(PNG 69 kb)", "s12864-019-5545-0": "Saliva of mosquitoes contains anti-platelet, anti-clotting, vasodilatory, anti-complement and anti-inflammatory substances that help the blood feeding process. The salivary polypeptides are at a fast pace of evolution possibly due to their relative lack of structural constraint and possibly also by positive selection on their genes leading to evasion of host immune pressure.In this study, we used deep mRNA sequence to uncover for the first time the sialomes of four Amazonian anophelines species (Anopheles braziliensis, A. marajorara, A. nuneztovari and A. triannulatus) and extend the knowledge of the A. darlingi sialome. Two libraries were generated from A. darlingi mosquitoes, sampled from two localities separated ~\u20091100\u2009km apart. A total of 60,016 sequences were submitted to GenBank, which will help discovery of novel pharmacologically active polypeptides and the design of specific immunological markers of mosquito exposure. Additionally, in these analyses we identified and characterized novel phasmaviruses and anpheviruses associated to the sialomes of A. triannulatus, A. marajorara and A. darlingi species.Besides their pharmacological properties, which may be exploited for the development of new drugs (e.g. anti-thrombotics), salivary proteins of blood feeding arthropods may be turned into tools to prevent and/or better control vector borne diseases; for example, through the development of vaccines or biomarkers to evaluate human exposure to vector bites. The sialotranscriptome study reported here provided novel data on four New World anopheline species and allowed to extend our knowledge on the salivary repertoire of A. darlingi. Additionally, we discovered novel viruses following analysis of the transcriptomes, a procedure that should become standard within future RNAseq studies.Anopheline mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae: Anophelinae) of the Anopheles Meigen, 1818 genus are important in public health because they are vectors of human malaria parasites in addition to arboviruses. In Brazil they are popularly known as \u201cmuri\u00e7oca\u201d, \u201cmosquito prego\u201d, \u201csuvela\u201d, \u201cpernilongo\u201d, and \u201ccarapan\u00e3\u201d [1]. Their development comprise the stages of egg, larvae (four instars), and pupae, which are aquatic, while the adult stage is terrestrial. Both male and female adults feed on carbohydrates from flowers and fruits; however, only females are hematophagous, using the proteins found in host blood for the production and development of their eggs [2]. While feeding blood, they can transmit pathogens to their hosts.Currently, the Anopheles genus includes 465 formally recognized species, which are subdivided into seven subgenera: Anopheles (cosmopolitan, 182 species), Baimaia (Oriental, one species), Cellia (Old World, 220 species), Kerteszia (Neotropical, 12 species), Lophopodomyia (Neotropical, six species), Nyssorhynchus (Neotropical, 39 species), and Stethomyia (Neotropical, five species) [3]. Worldwide, the primary vectors of human malaria parasites belong to the subgenera Anopheles, Cellia, Kerteszia and Nyssorhynchus.In the Americas, the dominant vector species belong to the Anopheles (three species) and Nyssorhynchus (six species) subgenera [4]. Among species of the subgenus Nyssorhynchus, Anopheles darlingi is the primary vector in Brazil, particularly in the Brazilian Amazon, and in other countries in South America [4, 5]. The remaining dominant vector species are A. albimanus, a member of the A. albitarsis complex, A. marajoara, A. aquasalis, and A. nuneztovari [4]. Other species of the Nyssorhynchus subgenus may be secondary local vectors or were found naturally infected with malaria parasite, such as A. benarrochi, A. rangeli, A. oswaldoi s.l., A. strodei, A. rondoni, A. trinkae, A. braziliensis, A. triannulatus, and A. mattogrossensis [6, 7].Anopheles darlingi is one of the most anthropophilic and efficient malaria vector in the Neotropical region, particularly in the Brazilian Amazon region [5, 8]. It is mainly a riverine mosquito, amply distributed in the rainforest but also it is found in other regions from Brazil, with exception of the dry areas of northeastern region. Anopheles darlingi also efficiently adapts in areas of deforestation and altered environments, favoring its abundance and expansion and consequently triggering malaria outbreaks. Adults of this species bite throughout the night [7, 8], however, often two biting peaks have been observed, one at sunset and the other at dawn. Specimens of A. darlingi have been captured in both indoor and outdoor environments, with predominance for the later [8].Anopheles marajoara is a member of the A. albitarsis complex. In the past, it was believed that A. marajoara was a secondary or local vector of minor importance. However, studies conducted in peri-urban areas of the city of Macap\u00e1, in the state of Amap\u00e1, Brazil, demonstrated that it can be a significant regional vector [9\u201311] as well as in Boa Vista, in the state of Roraima [12]. Supporting these findings, in the District of Cora\u00e7\u00e3o, state of Amap\u00e1, A. marajoara was the most frequent species, together with A. darlingi and A. braziliensis, showing anthropophilic behavior and being captured in both indoor and outdoor environments [13, 14].Previous studies have reported A. braziliensis as a zoophilic species with little or no importance in malaria transmission [1, 15] or as a secondary vector [5]. It has, however, been found infected with human malaria parasites in the states of Amazonas [8, 16], Amap\u00e1 [9], Rond\u00f4nia [17], and Roraima [12]. Curiously, in the District of Cora\u00e7\u00e3o, state of Amap\u00e1, A. braziliensis was one of the three most abundant and anthropophilic species. It was captured in both indoor and outdoor environments, although it was more abundant outdoors [14]. Thus, A. braziliensis may play some role in malaria transmission when at high density.Anopheles triannulatus sensu lato is predominantly zoophagic, exophilic, and is often found in the forest of the Brazilian Amazon region, but also it is easily found in the edge of forests. However, A. triannulatus s.l. has been reported with human malaria parasites in different regions of Brazil [7, 11, 18], as well as Peru and Venezuela [19, 20]; however, due to its behavior and habitat it has been recognized as a secondary vector.Currently, Anopheles nuneztovari is recognized as a species complex, where A. nuneztovari s.s. is incriminated as an important human malaria vector in Colombia and Venezuela, showing endo and exophagic behaviors, and elevated levels of anthropophily and infection rate [21, 22]. On the other hand, the Brazilian populations of A. nuneztovari s.l. are predominantly zoophagic; however, this species has been reported to be infected with Plasmodium spp. in five states of the Brazilian Amazon region [6, 7, 23], and it was incriminated as a local vector in the state of Amap\u00e1, Brazil [11]. Based on recent studies, A. nuneztovari s.l. may consist of two or more species within the Brazilian Amazon [24, 25], likely with different susceptibility to malaria parasites.From the five species mentioned above, only A. darlingi has been studied under genomic and proteomic approaches, including transcriptome salivary gland analyses [26, 27]. In this study, we present next generation sequencing and sialotranscriptome approaches to investigate the salivary protein composition of five anopheline species from the Brazilian Amazon region, which include two samples of A. darlingi, an important malaria vector in this region, Anopheles marajoara, an important local malaria vector, and Anopheles nuneztovari, Anopheles triannulatus, and Anopheles braziliensis, secondary malaria vectors. Additionally, we discuss the evolutionary aspects of these secreted salivary compounds with other anopheline salivary protein previously studied. These protein sequences may help identification by mass spectrometry of polypeptides of pharmacological interest, or to help in the design of immunological markers of vector exposure.The Anopheles virus landscape has been scarcely studied. The O\u2019nyong-nyong arbovirus is the only Anopheles vectored virus yet reported, and the insect specific viruses of most Anophelines have been barely explored [28]. Here, by assessing mosquito sialotranscriptome data, we were able to identify and characterize three novel viruses associated to A. triannulatus, A. marajoara, and A. darlingi species. The detected viruses correspond to emergent clades of insect-specific viruses, predominantly hosted by mosquitoes.The five anopheline species used in this study were collected in the Brazilian Amazon region (see Fig.\u00a01 and Additional file 1: Table S1). Following extraction of salivary RNA of the organisms using RNeasy, and determination of their quality by a Bioanalyzer Nano Chip, messenger mRNA was purified using an oligo-dT protocol. This was used to make the cDNA libraries using the NEBNExt Ultra Directional RNA kit, which were sequenced in an Illumina Hiseq 2500 DNA sequencer (for details see the methods section). Over 115 million reads were obtained for each of the A. darlingi libraries, and from 41 to 76 million reads for the other 4 libraries (Additional file 1: Table S2 and S3). From ~\u20096 to 38 thousand CDS were extracted from each of the five assemblies, varying in average from 615 to 1200\u2009nt in length (Additional file 1: Table S4).Based on our previous review on the sialome of nematocera blood suckers [29], as well as on the most recent analysis of anopheline sialomes [30], we classified and retrieved 723 full length or near full length transcripts from the five anopheline species under study. After removing some redundant sequences (by restricting sequences within 98% identity), these were reduced to 593 sequences, partitioned among the species as follows: A. braziliensis, 126; A. darlingi, 102; A. marajoara, 170; A. nuneztovari, 106; A. triannulatus, 89. These sequences are available in the hyperlinked Additional file 2: Spreadsheet S1. Additional file 1: Table S5 summarizes these sequences classified into their families, average expression indexes and references to their functional status, when known.From inspection of Additional file 1: Table S5, it is evident that the most expressed transcripts code for gVAG proteins, which are members of the antigen-5 family (of unknown function) [31, 32], and the 30\u2009kDa antigen/Aegyptin protein family, an inhibitor of collagen-induced platelet aggregation [33\u201336]. The D7 family (acting as kratagonists of biogenic amines and lipid mediators of hemostasis) [37\u201340], and the anti-thrombin peptide family (cE5/anophelin) are also well expressed [41\u201345], as are the ATP/ADP hydrolyzing enzymes apyrase/5\u2019nucleotidase (inhibitors of ADP-induced platelet aggregation) [46, 47] and peroxidases, shown to inhibit catecholamine vasoconstrictor effects [48, 49].When the EI for members of the apyrase/5\u2032-nucleotidase-coding transcripts are analyzed (Additional file 1: Table S6), two groups of transcripts are apparent, one with EI larger than 25 and another with values smaller than 11. Alignment of their protein sequences with other anopheline proteins from [30] (Additional file 3: Figure S1) shows two distinct clades, named 5Nuc and Apy in the figure, with New World (NW) and Old World (OW) as sub clades. Notably, all products associated with high EI values clustered in the 5Nuc clade, while those with smaller values clustered in the Apy clade (Additional file 3: Figure S1).The salivary apyrase of Aedes aegypti, belonging to the 5\u2032-nucleotidase superfamily, is the only mosquito salivary apyrase thus far characterized biochemically. The coding gene product was found following chromatographic purification of the activity followed by tryptic digestion of the enzyme, Edman degradation of the products, and PCR-based transcript identification [47]. The product was later cloned and recombinantly expressed, with verification of the apyrase and platelet inhibitor activities [50]. In anophelines the apyrase gene was apparently duplicated early in the anopheline evolution to produce 2 genes, named apyrase and 5\u2032-nucleotidase [31, 32, 51, 52]. However, the substrate specificities of these two enzymes are so far unknown. Perhaps the two enzymes both work as a typical apyrase, hydrolyzing ATP to AMP, or perhaps only one has apyrase activity while the other further hydrolyzes AMP to adenosine. These experiments remain to be done.While Old World anophelines appear to have one gene coding for a salivary peroxidase, New World species appear to have multiple copies of salivary peroxidase-encoding genes [30]. Indeed, the phylogeny reconstruction of the known anopheline peroxidase sequences including those disclosed in this work shows multiple peroxidases for all New World anophelines, including 2 distinct clades for A. darlingi containing 6 sequences deriving from at least 3 genes (Additional file 3: Figure S2). Interestingly, two sequences, one from A. albimanus and the other from A. braziliensis, form a robust subclade within a clade from solely Old-World species, named NW in Additional file 3: Figure S2. These clades also grouped sequences that have similar expression indexes, as indicated by the symbols +, ++ or +++ assigned from low, medium, or high expression indexes.This family contains one of the first cloned salivary protein from a mosquito [53] and was later found to belong to the odorant binding superfamily [54]. D7 proteins function as kratagonists (agonist binders) of biogenic amines and eicosanoid mediators of inflammation [37]. One A. stephensi protein named hamadarin was shown to inhibit blood clotting [55]. Several of these proteins have been crystalized [38\u201340]. In A. gambiae there are 3 genes coding for 2 domain proteins (large D7 proteins), and 5 genes coding for short D7 proteins (single domains) [56], arranged in tandem. Interestingly, the last gene coding for the long or short protein was poorly expressed, and it was proposed they may be turning into pseudogenes. The alignment of the long D7 proteins of the Amazonian anophelines with the known anopheline homologues shows a clear clade of New World genes coding for D7-L1 and D7-L2, but no genes coding for the D7-L3 proteins (Additional file 3: Figure S3). Note that the D7-L3 of the New World species A. darlingi and A. albimanus, shown in the figure, were previously deducted from their genomes. Previous analysis of the D7 gene cluster in anophelines also, suggested that D7L1 was lost in A. darlingi and A. albimanus, as well as in other Old World anopheline species [30], It is likely this is the case for the four new Amazonian species analyzed here, or, more presumably, the gene was lost by their common ancestor. In fact, the two A. marajoara and A. braziliensis sequences shown in the phylogenetic tree (Additional file 3: Figure S3) and the additional ones reported in the hyperlinked spreadsheet S1 may be allelic variants.The alignment of the short D7 proteins, named D7r1 through D7r5, also shows the inexistence of gene expression of the D7r5 from the Amazonian anophelines as deducted from their transcriptomes, although they were found in the genomes of A. darlingi and A. albimanus [30]. Two related transcripts from A. nuneztovari were found expressed with EI between 1 and 2, although their counterparts are better expressed, with EI values above 10% (Additional file 3: Figure S4).The antigen 5 family is ubiquitously found in sialotranscriptomes of blood sucking arthropods [57]. Several members of this family have been described in anophelines and other mosquitoes, but no mosquito protein of this family has been functionally characterized. In Stomoxys calcitrans, a salivary antigen 5 protein has been found to bind to the Fab region of immunoglobulins and could inhibit complement activation [58, 59]. A recombinant protein from the triatomine bug, Dipetalogaster maxima, displays superoxide dismutase activity and inhibits platelet activation by low doses of collagen [60]. An antigen 5 protein expressed in the salivary glands of the horse fly, Tabanus yao, exceptionally acquired a disintegrins RGD domain, as well as a hydrophobic pocket that efficiently scavenges leukotrienes; thus defining a bifunctional activity of platelet aggregation inhibitor and leukotriene kratagonist [61, 62]. With this diverse list of functions, it is difficult to predict the adaptive value of these proteins in mosquitoes.The alignment of the deducted Amazonian anopheline proteins belonging to the antigen 5 family, together with those previously described for anopheline mosquitoes [30], shows that all transcripts cluster within the gVAG clade, while none have been found in the other six clades (Additional file 3: Figure S5). Notice also that the transcripts coding for these proteins are highly expressed, many having EI values above 50%, reaching 100% in A. darlingi and A. braziliensis, meaning it is the most abundant transcript found in the sialotranscriptome of these species.The 30 kDa antigen from Ae. aegypti was the first described member of this family [63], and it was later characterized as an inhibitor of collagen-induced platelet aggregation [33, 34]. Anopheline members of this family were identified as glycine-acidic rich proteins [56], later shown to be related to aegyptin, and also to inhibit collagen-induced platelet aggregation [64]. Proteins of this family have a more complex amino terminus and a less complex glycine rich, acidic, carboxy terminus. A protein named Simplagrin was found in salivary transcriptomes of black flies; very divergent from mosquito aegyptins, but conserving the general structure of a complex followed by a less complex amino acid sequence and was also able to inhibit collagen-induced platelet aggregation [65], indicating this protein family was present ~ 150 million years ago in the blood-feeding precursors of black flies and mosquitoes. This protein family is unique to Culicoidea. While Aedes mosquitoes have more than one gene of this family expressed in their salivary glands [66, 67], anopheline mosquitoes appear to have only one [30, 56, 68\u201370]. The sialotranscriptome of Amazonian anophelines indicate these mosquitoes also have a single gene, with possible exception of A. nuneztovari, all with high expression indices (Additional file 3: Figure S6). Whether the two genes from A. nuneztovari result from a gene duplication, or whether it derives from single gene from two cryptic subspecies, remain to be determined.The uniquely anopheline family named SG7 was first discovered in a salivary transcriptome of A. gambiae [31, 32]. A second member of this family was later discovered in A. gambiae [56]. Other anopheline species were also shown to express this protein family [26, 69, 70]. A member of the family from A. stephensi was characterized as an inhibitor of the kallikrein/bradykinin pathway and named anophensin [71]. Interestingly one SG7 member from A. albimanus had demonstrated anti-complement activity and was named albicin [72]. More recently, salivary gland homogenates of A. aquasalis were shown to have a similar activity [73]. Interestingly, this family appears to have originated from a gene duplication from an aegyptin-coding gene that evolved to the present day SG7 [30, 74]. Additional file 3: Figure S7 depicts the evolutionary relationships between the known members of the SG7 family with those disclosed in this study.The SG1 family, exclusive of anophelines, is related to the 62/34\u2009kDa family of culicines, most arranged as single exon genes and postulated to be acquired by horizontal transmission from a bacterial host early in the evolution of Culicidae [29]. The function of any member of this family is still unknown. Seven members are recognizable in A. gambiae, but some (SG1 and SG1a) were missing in A. darlingi and A. albimanus [30]. The phylogram depicted in Additional file 3: Figure S8 shows the lack of SG1 and SG1a members in all New World species. The figure also shows many variants of the SG1 sub-families within the New World species, but this may be due to allelic variation in the same gene rather than reflecting gene duplications.This is a uniquely anopheline family coding for acidic polypeptides, containing a signal peptide indicative of secretion and a mature molecular weight of ~\u20096.5\u2009kDa. The cE5 polypeptide was described during the first sialotranscriptome of A. gambiae [32], while the polypeptide named anophelin was described as the A. albimanus thrombin inhibitor [41, 42]. Alignment of the known members [30] of this family with those found in the present study produces the phylogram shown in Additional file 3: Figure S9. The Amazonian anopheline transcripts coding for members of this family are reasonably well expressed, with EI values ranging from 8 to 57.This family of secreted polypeptides was first described in Aedes where it has a doublet of positively charged amino acids in its carboxy terminus. However, in A. darlingi it was found a homolog without the basic doublet, and similar proteins were found in other Old World anopheline species [29], Additional file 3: Figure S10 shows the alignment of culicine and anopheline sequences, the deducted amino acid motif and the phylogenetic tree derived from the alignment. Despite being a reasonably simple motif, when used to search matches of the non-redundant protein database from the NCBI, with over 160 million entries, only mosquito proteins were retrieved.After mapping the reads to the assembled transcripts of each species transcriptome, it becomes possible to evaluate the rate of synonymous and non-synonymous polymorphism among the different protein classes. Previously we observed an increased rate of non-synonymous polymorphisms in salivary secreted proteins when compared to salivary housekeeping proteins, using transcriptomes from ticks and hematophagous insects [75\u201378]. Following selection of transcripts that have 100 or more read depth coverage, and with more than 15 transcripts in each functional class, it is observed that the secreted and the unknown class have the highest rate of non-synonymous to synonymous polymorphism (Additional file 1: Table S7). This is not an artifact of excess coverage of the transcripts of the secreted class, as the protein synthesis class has high coverage depth and has one of the lowest rates of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations. The high non-synonymous rate observed for the secreted class may reflect a reduced mutational constraint of these proteins, and additionally they may be under positive selection to escape their hosts\u2019 immune pressure [79].Metatranscriptomic surveys of diverse invertebrate taxa have been successfully employed to reveal an astonishing diversity of RNA viruses [80]. Here, in parallel to the characterization of the endogenous profile of Anophelines sialotranscriptomes, we effectively identified adventitious RNA sequences corresponding to three novel viruses associated to A. triannulatus, A. marajoara, and A. darlingi. The detected viruses correspond to emergent clades of insect-specific negative-strand single RNA viruses, predominantly hosted by mosquitoes: Orthophasmavirus (Bunyavirales) and Anphevirus (Mononegavirales).The Orthophasmavirus genus (Phasmaviridae) was established by the discovery of two viruses in phantom midges (family Chaoboridae) from North America: Kigluaik phantom orthophasmavirus (KPOPV) and Nome phantom orthophasmavirus (NOMV) [81]. In turn, four additional viruses which clustered with KPOPV and NOMV were identified in mosquitoes and cockroaches from China [82] and dubbed Wuhan mosquito virus 1 and 2 (WMV1 & WMV2), Shuangao insect virus 2, and Wuchang cockroach virus 1, and incorporated to the genus. Furthermore, three similar viruses derived from metagenomic libraries of magpie moths and pooled Odonata species appear to be related to phasmaviruses [80]. Evolutionary studies suggest that phasmaviruses are sister clades of joniviruses and feraviruses with similar genomic architecture. Phasmaviruses are multipartite ssRNA(\u2212) viruses presenting three genome segments: S, M, and L ranging from 1.8\u20132.2, 2.0\u20132.8, and 6.5\u20136.7\u2009kb in length [83]. Phasmaviruses encode nucleoproteins (S segment), glycoproteins (M segment), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRPs) (L segment). Additionally, the S segments appear to encode also NSs proteins at equilocal position with joniviruses. In order to investigate the eventual presence of viral RNA in our datasets, we subjected de novo assemblies to bulk BLASTX searches against the NCBI refseq viral protein database. Interestingly, a 6186\u2009nt contig from A. triannulatus showed a significant hit (56% amino acid (aa) identity; E-value\u2009=\u20090, query coverage\u2009=\u200999%) with the RdRP of WMV1. Further read mapping and polishing extended the contig into a 6494\u2009nt sequence (RNA 1), supported by 69,379 reads (mean coverage\u2009=\u20091328X), encoding a single 6339\u2009nt ORF. A 2112 aa protein was predicted, presenting a Bunyavirus_RdRP functional domain (910\u20131225 aa coordinates; pfam04196, E-value\u2009=\u20094.81e-06) (Additional file 3: Figure S11A). To explore this putative RdRP, multiple alignments were generated with representative polymerases of Bunyavirales type species (Additional file 3: Figure S11.B). All major catalytic motifs A-C, including the SDD motif of segment-negative stranded RNA viruses, pre motif A, motif D-E, and conserved N-terminal domain region were detected, suggesting that the predicted RdRP could be functional. In addition, it became evident that the predicted replicase shared significant similarity with the RdRP of the Orthophasmavirus KPOPV. In this scenario, KPOPV segments M and S were queried against the A. triannulatus sialotranscriptome, and two contigs of 2061\u2009nt and 996\u2009nt were retrieved which were curated into a 2246\u2009nt (RNA 2, mean coverage\u2009=\u2009396X) and 2069\u2009nt (RNA 3, mean coverage\u2009=\u2009174X). RNA 2 presents a single 2052\u2009nt ORF encoding a putative glycoprotein similar to that of WMV1 (51% aa identity; E-value\u2009=\u20090, query coverage\u2009=\u200999%). The putative glycoprotein precursor protein was explored in detail, and a signal peptide and cleavage were detected at the NH2 terminal region, three transmembrane sites, three putative glycosylation sites, and a highly conserved Gn/Gc cleavage region at the 217 aa position (Additional file 3: Figure S11.E), suggesting that Gn, as expected, is reduced in length. No evidence of NSm protein was found in RNA2. RNA 3 presents three ORFs, sharing the segment architecture with RNA 3 of WMV1. Only the ORF2 351 aa product shared sequence similarity with the nucleoprotein of WMV1 (52% aa identity; E-value\u2009=\u20093e-107, query coverage\u2009=\u200998%). ORF1 encodes a 123 aa protein with similarity with an unannotated product of WMV1, which has been suggested to be a putative NSs [82]. Lastly, ORF3 encodes a 106 aa product with no similarity with other virus (or insect) proteins. The 3\u2032 termini of RNA1\u20133 shared a 100% conserved stretch of 14\u2009nt, which in Bunyavirales is associated to replication [83]. This exact terminus was observed also in RNA1 of WMV1 (Additional file 3: Figure S11.D). Given the intrinsic structural and functional features detected in the virus sequences, we tentatively propose that they correspond to a new virus, which we dubbed A. triannulatus orthophasmavirus (AtOPV). In order to entertain this hypothesis, we generated phylogenetic insights of the putative virus using the predicted RdRP of AtOPV and recognized/proposed members of the Bunyavirales order in multiple alignments and maximum likelihood trees (Additional file 3: Figure S11.F-H). Unequivocally, AtOPV clustered within the Phasmaviridae family (Additional file 3: Figure S11.F). Local topology of the obtained tree suggests that AtOPV clades among a distinctive sub-group of viruses hosted in both mosquitoes (Culex tritaeniorhynchus) and midges (Chaoborus trivitattus), including KPOPV, WMV1 and WMV2 (Additional file 3: Figure S11.G-H). Our results expand the distribution of phasmaviruses to South America, and suggest that Anophelines are also host of these insect-specific viruses. Future studies should focus on assessing the prevalence and potential effect of virus presence in A. triannulatus.The recently recognized Anphevirus genus corresponds to an unassigned family within the Mononegavirales order. The last International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) report [84] indicates there is only one member species: Xincheng anphevirus including the Xincheng mosquito virus (XcMV) associated to A. sinensis, which was described in a large metagenomics study focusing in ssRNA(\u2212) invertebrate viruses [82]. The Anphevirus genus appears to be closely related to members of Bornaviridae and Nyamiviridae family. A number of novel Anphevirus-like viruses have been described recently in West Australian Culex mosquitoes [85], West African A. gambiae mosquitoes [86], and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes [87]. Overall, anpheviruses have been characterized by monosegmented 11\u201312\u2009kb long negative-stranded RNA genomes encoding in its antigenome six/seven non-overlapping ORFs associated with nucleoproteins (N), small transmembrane proteins (STM), glycoproteins (G1\u20132), small ZnF proteins (ZnF), and large RdRPs. Anphevirus, like other Mononegavirales, have their ssRNA(\u2212) genomes encapsidated within the nuclecapsid and the RNA polymerase complex. Their RNA genome is used by the RdRP as a template to transcribe discrete mRNAs from the subgenomic genes, which are separated by gene junctions. These mRNAs are capped and polyadenylated. In our bulk BLASTX searches against the NCBI refseq viral protein database, two contigs from A. marajoara (12,764\u2009nt) and A. darlingi (13,063\u2009nt) showed significant hits with the RdRP of Bolahun virus (BV, 41\u201346% identity, E-value\u2009=\u20090). BV is a recently proposed anphevirus found in A. gambiae mosquitoes from Burkina Faso (variant 1) and Liberia (variant 2), sharing a 94.2% nt pairwise identity [86].After contig curation by read mapping, two viral like sequences emerged, harboring the genomic organization of anpheviruses, which we cautiously designated as A. marajoara virus (AnMV, 12,265\u2009nt) and A. darlingi virus (AnDV, 12,521\u2009nt). The overall pairwise nucleotide identity between AnMV and AnDV was 61%. Sequence annotation revealed that both sequences presented in their putative antigenomes six ORFs encoding typical anpheviruses predicted gene products in their canonical architecture: 3\u2032-N-STM-G1-G2-ZnF-RdRP-5\u2032 (Additional file 3: Figure S12.A). ORF1 of AnMV and AnDV encode a 424\u2013428 aa protein sharing 49.2% identity among them and a 30\u201329% similarity with their closest hit: Aedes anphevirus (AeAV) and Gambiae virus N proteins, respectively. HHPred searches suggested that both AnMV and AnDV Ns shared protein homology with the p40 nucleoprotein of the Borna disease virus (BoDV-NP, E-value\u2009=\u20093.4e-5, probability 98.3%), a feature which was also associated to the AeAV N [87]. ORF2 AnMV and AnDV products are short 120\u2013121 aa with two or one clear transmembrane domains, respectively, sharing a 29% pairwise aa similarity (the most divergent gene product among both viruses). The putatively 426\u2013457 aa glycoproteins encoded in ORF3 of AnMV and AnDV had no significant hits in both HHPred or BLASTP searches and shared 29.8% pairwise aa identity among them. ORF4 of AnMV and AnDV encode 647\u2013639 aa glycoproteins, presenting signal peptides in their N-terminus, followed by O- and N-linked glycosylated sites and two transmembrane domains in the C-terminus of the protein. AnDV presents an additional transmembrane domain in the N-region. Both glycoproteins shared a 71.8% aa pairwise similarity and 50\u201351% aa similarity to the G2 of Bolahun virus and Gambiae virus. In addition, as for the G2 of AeAV [87], both AnMV and AnDV G2 reported significant protein homology with the Human Herpesvirus 1 Envelope Glycoprotein B (HHV1-gB, E-value\u2009=\u20091e-10 and 1e-17, probability 98.1\u201397.5%). ORF5 encode a short 46\u201348 aa product with zinc ribbon type zinc finger domains which were evident when aligned with other anphevirus equilocal products by the significant conservation of Cysteine CXXC motifs (Additional file 3: Figure S12.H). Lastly, ORF6 encodes a ca. 230\u2009kDa RdRP, 2013\u20132018 aa long, presenting the expected Mononegavirales RdRP (Mononeg_RNA_Pol, E-value\u2009=\u20091.06e-63), mRNA capping (M_ne_mRNAcap, E-value\u2009=\u20092.54e-11) and guanine-7-methyltransferase (SAM_MT_MNV_L, E-value\u2009=\u20091.92e-10) domains. AnMV and AnDV RdRPs share a 66.9% aa pairwise identity and 50\u201351% similarity with other anpheviruses.Interestingly, while exploring the intergenic regions of AnMV and AnDV and other anphevirus we were able to pinpoint and characterize a conserved pattern of gene junctions separating the six/seven gene products. A central nucleotide conserved sequence was identified: reading in the antigenome as 3\u2032-UAAAAAACCCGCUAGUUA-5\u2032 tentatively functioning as polyadenylation signal terminating each cistron (P(A)Sig), spacer sequence (Sp) and transcription start site (Tstart) of the next mRNA species (Additional file 3: Figure S12.F). With minor variations, this oligomer was found in most gene junctions of all anpheviruses reported yet (Additional file 3: Figure S12 G).While polishing the AnDV sequence using our datasets we became aware that the virus was present in the RNA libraries corresponding to both the A. darlingi mosquitoes\u2019 samples collected from Macap\u00e1 (State of Amap\u00e1), and Manaus (State of Amazonas) (Additional file 3: Figure S12.I). Moreover, given the low intra-variability of viral reads in each sample (below 0.8%) we were able to assemble and easily differentiate the RNA virus genomes associated with the mosquitoes of both locations with high confidence (mean coverage of 2195/5371X; total virus reads 219,718/538083; 1488/4604 RPKM for AnDV-Mac and AnDV-Man, respectively), which shared an overall 94.7% sequence identity at the nucleotide level. Additionally, we observed that most polymorphism corresponded to silent SNPs, concomitant with higher sequence similarity for the predicted products at the aa level and accompanied with high sequence conservation at both the 3\u2032 leader regions and the conserved gene junctions (Additional file 3: Figure S12 B).Overall, these observations suggest that the observed variability is biological, and not artifactual. It is interesting that we observed such an elevated level of variation among strains of geographically distinct isolates. It is tempting to suggest that this could be evidence that the A. darlingi mosquito populations of both localities have been separated for an extended time limiting the horizontal transmission and eventual homogenization of virus populations. Future studies should provide insights into the phylogenomics aspects of these viruses.To assess the evolutionary landscape of the described viruses, we generated phylogenetic insights of the putative anpheviruses using their predicted RdRPs in multiple alignments and maximum likelihood trees with replicase proteins of virus members of the Mononegavirales order (Additional file 3: Figure S12.C). Both AnMV and AnDV RdRPs clustered in a sub-phylloclade of anpheviruses and other unclassified invertebrate viruses, having as divergent sister clades bornaviruses and nyamiviruses, as expected. Local topology of the obtained phylogenetic tree suggests that AnMV and AnDV are closely related and cluster among a sub-clade within anphevirus conformed also by BV and Gambiae virus (Additional file 3: Figure S12.D-E). The branching of AnMV and AnDV within a clade circumscribed to mosquito-specific viruses provides further support of the nature of the detected RNA sequences as evidence of bona fide mosquito viruses. Overall, our results provide evidence of novel anpheviruses associated to the Amazonian anophelines A. marajoara and A. darlingi.Transcriptomic, proteomic, and genomic studies have considerably improved, in the last ten to fifteen years, our understanding of complexity and functions of blood feeding insect salivary proteins. As far as the family Culicidae is concerned, 12 sialotranscriptomes are currently available, six of which on anopheline mosquitoes: four from Old world (A. gambiae, A. coluzzii, A. funestus, and A. stephensi) and two from New world species (A. albimanus and A. darlingi) [88]. Despite this considerable progress there is still much to learn since we still completely ignore the function of almost 40% of the putative mosquito salivary proteins identified thus far. Besides their pharmacological properties, which may be exploited for the development of new drugs (e.g. anti-thrombotics), salivary proteins of blood feeding arthropods may be turned into tools to prevent and/or better control vector borne diseases, for example, through the development of vaccines or biomarkers to evaluate human exposure to vector bites [89\u201391]. The sialotranscriptome study reported here provided novel data on four New World anopheline species and allowed us to extend our knowledge on the salivary repertoire of A. darlingi. This information may be helpful not only for the characterization of novel activities, but also for the identification of salivary biomarkers to evaluate human exposure to malaria vectors in Central and South America. This may be especially relevant since the A. gambiae gSG6, which proved to be a reliable marker of exposure to African [92\u201394], Asian [95], and Melanesian [96] malaria vectors it is not found in New World anopheline species, as suggested earlier [30] and confirmed by the present study. Additionally, we discovered novel viruses following analysis of the transcriptomes, a procedure that should become standard within future RNAseq studies.Adult mosquitoes were captured using a light trap, white Shannon-type, between 18:00 and 22:00\u2009h, and then transferred into cups, properly labeled with locality and collection date. At the end of the captures, the cups containing the mosquitoes were covered with moistened towel paper and transported alive inside tightly closed isothermal boxes to the Laborat\u00f3rio de Gen\u00e9tica de Popula\u00e7\u00f5es e Evolu\u00e7\u00e3o de Mosquitos Vetores at the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amaz\u00f4nia (INPA), in Manaus, Brazil. The following day, the specimens were identified using morphological keys of Forattini [15] and Faran and Linthicum [97]. Immediately after, the mosquitoes were cooled in a freezer at \u2212\u200920\u2009\u00b0C for a few minutes, transferred to an ice-chilled plate, when their salivary glands were dissected on a slide containing a drop of sterile Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) pH\u20097.4, under a stereomicroscope, SV11 model, Carl Zeiss. The salivary glands of each species were immediately transferred to an Eppendorf tube containing 200\u2009\u03bcL of RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientific) solution. Depending on the species analyzed, pools ranging from 80 to 97 pairs of salivary glands were dissected, kept at 4o C for 48\u2009h and then stored at \u2212\u200980\u2009\u00b0C until the RNA extraction. For more details, see Additional file 1: Table S1.Total RNA from salivary glands was extracted using an RNeasy mini total RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, USA), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.Tissue samples were submitted to the North Carolina State Genomic Sciences Laboratory (Raleigh, NC, USA) for Illumina RNA library construction and sequencing. Prior to library construction, RNA integrity, purity, and concentration were assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano Chip (Agilent Technologies, USA). Purification of messenger RNA (mRNA) was performed using the oligo-dT beads provided in the NEBNExt Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs, USA). Complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries for Illumina sequencing were constructed using the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (NEB) and NEBNext Mulitplex Oligos for Illumina (NEB) using the manufacturer-specified protocol. Briefly, the mRNA was chemically fragmented and primed with random oligos for first strand cDNA synthesis. Second strand cDNA synthesis was then carried out with dUTPs to preserve strand orientation information. The double-stranded cDNA was then purified, end repaired, and \u201ca-tailed\u201d for adaptor ligation. Following ligation, the samples were selected a final library size (adapters included) of 400\u2013550\u2009bp using sequential AMPure XP bead isolation (Beckman Coulter, USA). Library enrichment was performed and specific indexes for each sample were added during the protocol-specified PCR amplification. The amplified library fragments were purified and checked for quality and final concentration using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with a High Sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent Technologies, USA). The final quantified libraries were sequenced in an Illumina HiSeq 2500 DNA sequencer, utilizing 125\u2009bp single end sequencing flow cell with a HiSeq Reagent Kit v4 (Illumina, USA). One lane was run for both A. darlingi libraries, and another lane was run with the remaining four libraries. Flow cell cluster generation for the HiSeq2500 was performed using an automated cBot system (Illumina, USA). The software package Real Time Analysis (RTA), version 1.18.64, was used to generate raw bcl, or base call files, which were then de-multiplexed by sample into fastq files for data submission using bcl2fastq2 v2.16.0 software.Bioinformatic analyses were conducted following the methods described previously [76, 78], with some modifications. Briefly, the fastq files were trimmed of low quality reads (<\u200920), removed from contaminating primer sequences and concatenated for single-ended assembly using the Abyss (using k parameters from 21 to 91 in 5 fold increments) [98] and Trinity [99] assemblers. These two assemblers were used, because in our previous experience the Abyss assembler produces more novel contigs than the Trinity assembler, but unfortunately it tends to misassembly abundant contigs apparently due to inclusion of products containing introns. However, these abundantly expressed contigs are properly assembled by Trinity. The combined fasta files were further assembled using a iterative blast and CAP3 pipeline as previously described [100]. In the case of A. darlingi, the deducted coding sequences (CDS) of the assembled genome (downloaded from Vector Base) [101] were added to the last assembly stage. CDS were extracted based on the existence of a signal peptide in the longer open reading frame (ORF) and by similarities to other proteins found in the Refseq invertebrate database from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), proteins from Diptera deposited at NCBI\u2019s Genbank and from SwissProt. Accordingly, from ~\u20096 to 38 thousand CDS were extracted from each of the five assemblies, varying in average from 615 to 1200\u2009nt in length (Additional file 1: Table S4). The A. nuneztovari library produced the poorest assembly due to ~\u200925% rRNA contamination. The reads mapping to rRNA were excluded from the analysis.Reads for each library were mapped on the deducted CDS using blastn with a word size of 25, 1 gap allowed and 95% identity or better required. Up to five matches were allowed, if and only if, the scores were the same as the largest score. To compare transcript relative expression among contigs, we used the \u201cexpression index\u201d (EI) defined as the number of reads mapped to a particular CDS multiplied by 100 and divided by the largest found number of reads mapped to a single CDS. Detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP\u2019s) were performed with the program Samtools [102] the output of which was used by a program written in visual basic by JMR to assign the synonymous or non-synonymous status of the SNP. The final results were mapped into an excel spreadsheet. Functional classification of the transcripts was achieved by scanning the output of the different blast and rpsblast results using a vocabulary of ~\u2009400 words, the e value of the result and a result coverage >\u200975%. The classification of \u201cunknown\u201d was given if no match could be found.Protein alignments were done using clustalX [103], and phylogenies were inferred using the Mega v.6 package [104], The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the best nucleotide substitution matrix available for the alignment, as discovered by the Mega package. The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 500 replicates is taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed [105]. Other parameters are as indicated in the figure legends.Virus discovery and annotation was implemented as described in [106]. In brief, de novo assemblies were subjected to BLASTX searches (E-value\u2009=\u20091e-5) against refseq viral proteins available at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/viral/viral.1.protein.faa.gz. Hits were explored by hand and curated by iterative mapping of reads. ORFs were predicted by ORFinder as implemented in https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/orffinder/. Functional and structural domains of the predicted gene products were assessed with the NCBI CDD tool https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi and the HHPred tool https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/#/tools/hhpred. SignalP 4.1 http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/ was used to detect signal peptides and cleavage regions, TMHMM 2.0 http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0/ for transmembrane predictions, and NetNGlyc 1.0 http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/ for glycosylation site prediction. Abundance of virus reads was calculated by mapping with standard parameters using Bowtie2 http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml. Phylogenetic insights were based on multiple alignments of replicase proteins with MAFFT v7 https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/ with an E-INS-i iterative refinement method and BLOSUM64 scoring matrix for amino acids. Phylogenetically uninformative sites were trimmed using the GBlocks tool v.0.91b available as a web server at http://molevol.cmima.csic.es/castresana/Gblocks_server.html. Maximum likelihood trees were generated with FastTree v2.1 http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/ with JTT models of amino acid evolution, 1000 tree re-samples and local support values estimated with the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test.Aedes anphevirusA. darlingi virusA. marajoara virusA. triannulatus orthophasmavirusBorna disease virusGlycoproteinsHuman Herpesvirus 1International Committee on Taxonomy of VirusesKigluaik phantom orthophasmavirusNome phantom orthophasmavirusNucleoproteinNew WorldOld WorldRNA-dependent RNA polymeraseSystem of authorization and information in biodiversitySmall transmembrane proteinsWuhan mosquito virusXincheng mosquito virusSmall ZnF proteinsDr. Vera Margarete Scarpassa was supported by grant 3111/2012-Universal from Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado do Amazonas (Brazil).

The samples of A. darlingi were collected in two distinct localities: 1) in the District of Cora\u00e7\u00e3o (N 0\u00b0 01\u2032; W 51\u00b0 10\u2032), located at km 13 of the Duca Serra Road, in the outskirts of the Macap\u00e1 city, state of Amap\u00e1; 2) in the Ramal do Brasileirinho (S 3\u00b0 20\u2032 08.7\u2033; W 59\u00b0 52\u2032 16.8\u2033) located on the outskirts of city of Manaus, state of Amazonas. These localities are separated ~\u20091100\u2009km apart and in both localities there is malaria transmission. Samples of A. braziliensis were collected from the outskirts of Macap\u00e1 city (N 0\u00b0 1\u2032 13.71\u2033; W 51\u00b0 09\u2032 47.47\u2033), whereas A. marajoara and A. triannulatus were collected in the Santa B\u00e1rbara Farm (N 0\u00b0 17\u2032 28.4\u2033; W 50\u00b0 54\u2032 07.2\u2033), municipality of Macap\u00e1, state of Amap\u00e1, Brazil. Specimens of A. nuneztovari were captured in the Ramal do Sampaio (S 03\u00b0 41\u2032 51.8\u2033; W 59\u00b0 07\u2032 37.5\u2033), municipality of Autazes, state of Amazonas, Brazil. The salivary glands of A. darlingi, A. braziliensis, A. marajoara, and A. triannulatus used in this study were collected from wild mosquitoes (females) captured from the field, whereas those from A. nuneztovari were female descendants from the F1 generation reared in the insectary from wild mosquitoes (females) collected from field. The collections were authorized by the System of Authorization and Information in Biodiversity (SISBIO), with permanent license number 38440\u20131 awarded to VMS.\n\nFig. 1\nMap showing the locations sampled for anopheline mosquitoes.

(MHT 7748 kb)", "s12864-019-5482-y": "A previous laboratory study involving wild type, mutant and devR/dosR complemented strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis reported the attenuation phenotype of complemented strain, Comp1. This phenotype was intriguing since the parental strain H37Rv, devR mutant (Mut1) and additional complemented strains, Comp9 and Comp11, were virulent in the guinea pig model.Towards deciphering the mechanism underlying the attenuation of Comp1, a whole genome sequencing approach was undertaken. Eight Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) unique to the Comp1 strain were identified. Of these, 5 SNPs were non-synonymous and included a G\u279eA mutation resulting in a W1591Stop mutation in ppsD gene of the phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM) biosynthetic cluster. Targeted sequence analysis confirmed this mutation in only Comp1 strain and not in wild type (H37Rv), devR knockout (Mut1) or other complemented (Comp9 and Comp11) bacteria. Differential expression of the PDIM locus in Comp1 bacteria was observed which was associated with a partial deficiency of PDIM, an increased sensitivity to detergent and a compromised ability to infect human THP-1 cells.It is proposed that a spontaneous mutation in the ppsD gene of Comp1 underlies down-modulation of the PDIM locus which is associated with defects in permeability and infectivity as well as virulence attenuation in guinea pigs. Our study demonstrates the value of whole genome sequencing for resolving unexplainable bacterial phenotypes and recommends the assessment of PDIM status while assessing virulence properties of laboratory-manipulated strains of M. tuberculosis.Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) is characterized by the presence of a complex cell wall that is rich in high molecular weight lipids which are major determinants of virulence [1]. Phthiocerol dimycocerosates (PDIM), the most abundant of these lipids, are surface-exposed non-polar complex lipids that are made up of a mixture of long chain \u03b2-diols (phthiocerols) esterified by multimethyl-branched fatty acids named as mycocerosic acids [2\u20134]. PDIMs are produced by a limited group of mycobacterial species, most of which are pathogenic for humans such as M. tb, M. bovis, M. leprae, M. ulcerans, and M. marinum [2] and have attracted special attention due to the key role they play in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis and bacterial-host interactions [5\u201311]. A role for PDIM in\u00a0tuberculosis (TB) pathogenesis was suggested over four decades ago when a PDIM deficient H37Rv-derived strain of M. tb was found to be attenuated in guinea pigs [10]. Furthermore, an avirulent strain of M. tb coated with a mixture of PDIM and cholesteryl oleate persisted longer than the uncoated strain in tissues of infected mice [12]. Sequencing of the M. tb genome revealed that a stretch of ~\u200950\u2009kb containing ppsA-E, drrA-C, mas, mmpL7, fadD26, fadD28 and papA5, is dedicated to the biosynthesis and transport of PDIMs [13]. Genetic studies have established their role in virulence and pathogenesis. Mutants lacking or deficient in PDIM synthesis or translocation display altered colony morphology, increased membrane permeability phenotypes and are severely attenuated in animal models [8, 9, 14].We have previously described the properties of M. tb devR/dosR complemented strains (Comp1, Comp9 and Comp11) that express different levels of DevR due to differences in promoter strength and gene copy number [15, 16]. The devR mutant strain (Mut1) expresses only the DevR N-terminal signal receiver domain and lacks the DNA binding domain [17]. Mut1 bacteria were defective in expression of the DevR regulon and survival under hypoxia. Among the Comp strains, while Comp9 rescued the hypoxia adaptation defect, the Comp1\u00a0and Comp11 strains were unable to do so\u00a0as efficiently. Intriguingly, all of these strains (H37Rv, Mut1, Comp9 and Comp11), with the exception of Comp1 strain, were virulent in guinea pigs whereas Comp1 was highly attenuated [16].The present study aimed to decipher the mechanism underlying the puzzling attenuation phenotype of Comp1. Whole genome sequencing of Comp1 revealed the presence of 8 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) unique to the Comp1 strain. Of these, 5 SNPs were non-synonymous and included a spontaneous nonsense mutation, W1591Stop, in the ppsD gene of the PDIM biosynthetic cluster. Transcriptome analysis revealed differential expression of the PDIM locus in Comp1 bacteria that was associated with a partial deficiency of PDIM, an increased sensitivity to an anionic detergent (sodium dodecyl sulfate) and a compromised ability to infect THP-1 cells. We propose that down-modulation of the PDIM locus in Comp1 bacteria due to a spontaneous mutation in the ppsD gene is the likely molecular mechanism underlying attenuation and associated defects in Comp1 bacteria. Based on the spontaneous generation of PDIM deficient bacteria during in vitro culture, we recommend a routine assessment of PDIM while characterizing virulence of wild type and laboratory-manipulated M. tb strains.TrueSeq DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) was used to prepare the WGS library from purified genomic DNA sample of Comp1 strain. The quality and concentration of isolated DNA was assessed for OD260/OD280 ratio\u2009>\u20091.8, OD260/OD230 ratio\u00a0>\u00a01.9, DNA concentration between 250 to 500\u2009ng/\u03bcl and no visible evidence of DNA degradation or contamination with RNA. Approximately 1.5\u2009\u03bcg of high quality genomic DNA was used to generate fragments of size 300\u2013400\u2009bp by Covaris. Fragments were end-repaired by mixing with End Repair Mix and purified by Ampure XP reagent (Beckman Coulter). These fragments were adenylated and ligated to DNA Adapter Indexes for multiplexing with DNA Ligase Mix. The ligation products were purified and were subsequently enriched by PCR amplification with PCR Master Mix (TrueSeq DNA Sample Prep Kit, Illumina) according to manufacturer\u2019s recommended protocol. The quality and quantity of the genomic DNA library thus obtained was assessed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and real time PCR with Kapa Library Quant Kit (Kapa Biosystems) in ABI 7900HT system (Life Technologies). Genomic DNA library of fragment size between 400 to 500\u2009bp was selected and sequenced on the HiSeq-2000 System (Illumina) using TrueSeq PE Cluster Kit v3 and TrueSeq SBS Kit v3 (Illumina).The sequenced reads were mapped against the genome of M. tb H37Rv (NCBI accession number NC_000962) using three different mapping programs, Bowtie2 [18], Burrows-Wheeler aligner (BWA) [19] and MIRA [20]. The mapping results obtained with the Bowtie2 program, after removal of low-quality reads (Q\u2009<\u200920), represented an average genome coverage of 820x. A subset of the total reads (~\u200925%) were mapped to the reference genome using BWA (version 0.6.2), and MIRA (version 3.4), to check whether any gaps had been created in the mapped reconstruction of the Comp1 genome due to differences in the mapping algorithms. MIRA was used for performing both reference-based mapping and de novo assembly. The contigs generated through de novo assembly were further aligned to the mapping-based assembly in order to cover gaps in the reference-based mapping. It may be noted that most of the gaps remaining after this exercise were present only within multicopy regions, such as insertion sequences (IS), transposons, repeat-containing proteins (Rv1587c, Rv1588c), etc.Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calls and consensus sequence generation were subsequently performed using the pileup function in SAMtools (version 0.1.16) [21] with the mapping outputs of Bowtie2 and BWA. The variant-calling program integrated in the MIRA software was used to list all the SNPs/ InDels (Insertion and deletion of bases) obtained from the mapping results. The whole genome sequencing data of Comp1 has been submitted to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/) under accession number PRJNA492224.DNA isolated from M. tb strains H37Rv, Mut1, Comp1, Comp9 and Comp11 were subjected to amplification using the primer pair ppsDseqF and ppsDseqR (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S1). The template was denatured at 90\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s, followed by primer annealing at 65\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s and elongation at 72\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s. The amplified product was sequenced by Sanger methodology using ppsDseqF primer (Additional file 1: Table S1).M. tb strains were cultured as described above with shaking at 220\u2009rpm till A595 ~\u20090.2\u20130.3. A 50\u2009ml aliquot was centrifuged and RNA was isolated using TRI reagent method as described [16]. Reverse transcription was performed on the total extracted RNA with random hexamer primers and cDNA High capacity Reverse Transcriptase kit (ABI, USA). mRNAs were quantitated by real-time PCR using gene-specific primers (Additional file 1: Table S1) in MyIQ thermal cycler (Biorad, USA). For whole genome transcriptome, the data deposited with NCBI GEO datasets (Accession number GSE30264) was analysed as described previously [16].M. tb log phase cultures (5\u2009ml) were labelled for lipids by pulsing them with 0.5\u2009\u03bcCi of Propionic acid [1-14C] sodium salt (specific activity 54\u2009mCi/ mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemical, Inc) or 0.5\u2009\u03bcCi of Acetic acid [1-14C] sodium salt (specific activity 31.7\u2009mCi/ mmol; Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology, Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India). Cultures were harvested after 16\u2009h of radioactive pulse by centrifugation and the pellets were heat inactivated at 95\u2009\u00b0C for 30 min before proceeding for lipid extraction. Apolar lipid extract was prepared by adding 2\u2009ml of methanolic solution of 0.3% sodium chloride and 1\u2009ml of petroleum ether (60\u201380\u2009\u00b0C) to the cell pellet. Extraction was performed by mixing in a tube rotator at room temperature for 30\u2009min followed by centrifugation at 2500\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min. After phase separation, the upper layer consisting of apolar lipids was carefully removed and collected in a separate vial. One ml of petroleum ether was added to the remnant lower layer, vortexed and mixed for another 15\u2009min. Phase separation was performed again by centrifugation and the upper layer obtained this time was pooled with the previous one. The upper layer comprising of apolar lipids was dried at 60\u2009\u00b0C and resuspended in chloroform: methanol (2:1, v/v). Total radioactivity was measured as counts per minute (cpm) in a scintillation counter. Samples were dried and re-dissolved in chloroform: methanol (2:1, v/v) to achieve equal cpm/ml of lipid extract. Approximately, 10,000 counts from all the extracts belonging to the different cultures were spotted on thin layer chromatography (TLC) plate (silica gel 60) and developed uni-dimensionally in the solvent system petroleum ether: diethyl ether (90:10). The lipids were visualized with a Typhoon FLA 700 Phosphorimager.M. tb cultures were grown to mid-logarithmic phase (A595 ~\u20090.4) in DTA medium. The culture cell densities were adjusted to an A595 of 0.005 (in 10\u2009ml cultures). Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was added at a final concentration of 0.05 and 0.1% and the cultures were incubated for 10\u2009days. Aliquots were collected after 0, 1, 4 and 10\u2009days and the number of viable bacteria was estimated by plating on 7H11 agar medium supplemented with OADC. Total CFUs were finalized after 6\u2009weeks.The inocula for infection were prepared by culturing M. tb strains with shaking to A595\u2009\u223c\u20090.6 in DTA medium. THP-1 cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Briefly, THP-1 cells were seeded at 0.25\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 cells per well in 24-well tissue culture plates and were differentiated by the addition of phorbol 12-myristate acetate (30\u2009nM) for 24\u2009h. The monolayers were infected with M. tb strains at a low multiplicity of infection (1 bacterium per 50 macrophages) for 20\u2009h and washed with incomplete RPMI 1640. Fresh complete RPMI 1640 was added to each well and the plates were incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C for upto 7\u2009days. Intracellular viable bacteria on day 0, 1, 4 and 7 post-infection were quantified by lysis of the monolayers with 0.025% SDS, and plating as described above. Infectivity is expressed as a percentage of bacteria internalized on day 1 compared to the number of bacilli used for infection.Statistical analysis wherever applicable was performed using Student\u2019s t-test unless otherwise mentioned.We previously reported that devR complemented strain Comp1, was severely attenuated in guinea pigs, whereas the parental H37Rv and the devR mutant (Mut1) strains were virulent [16]. Two other complemented strains, Comp9 and Comp11, were not attenuated in guinea pigs in the same study [16]. An assessment of this previously generated virulence data [16] indicated that Comp1 strain was attenuated. The attenuation of Comp1 could not be explained because the parental H37Rv and Mut1 strains exhibited a virulent phenotype (Table 1, described originally by Majumdar et al. [16]).The genomic region encompassing the ppsD mutation in Comp1 was amplified by PCR from DNA of all the strains and analyzed by Sanger sequencing. The nonsense codon (TGA) was uniquely detected only in Comp1 DNA while the other strains, namely H37Rv, Mut1, Comp9 and Comp11, contained wild type ppsD gene sequence (Fig. 1b).Previous characterization of a panel of devR complemented (Comp) strains of M. tb revealed that Comp1, but not H37Rv, Mut1 or any other Comp strains, was attenuated in guinea pigs [16]. The present study aimed to utilize a functional genomics approach to explain this puzzling phenotype of Comp1 bacteria. Sequencing of the Comp1 genome revealed a nonsense mutation at codon 1591 that altered a tryptophan codon to a stop codon in ppsD, a component of PpsA-PpsE type 1 polyketide synthase which synthesizes the phthiocerol backbone of PDIM. Interestingly, the position of this SNP is otherwise a conserved one (occupied mostly by aromatic amino acids), and is part of a keto-acyl reductase domain (SMART domain ID: PKS_KR) that modifies the \u03b2-keto-thioester intermediate during PDIM synthesis [26]. Gene expression analysis further revealed a lower level of transcripts from the PDIM cluster in Comp1 compared to the other strains. The ~\u200950\u2009kb gene cluster involved in PDIM biosynthesis and transport is organized into three transcriptional units: (i) a major unit spanning ~\u200932\u2009kb from fadD26 to papA5 genes (Rv2930-Rv2939) and including ppsA-E, (ii) a second unit containing only the mas gene from the complementary strand and, (iii) a third unit including the fadD28 and mmpL7 ORF [8, 9]. The nonsense mutation in ppsD was associated with lowered transcription of the downstream genes (ppsE and drr) likely due to transcriptional polarity effects. The selective deficiency in PDIM synthesis was indicated by a defect in 14C-propionate labeling of branched lipids. Taking together the results of genome sequencing, expression data and PDIM analysis, the attenuation of Comp1 is attributed to this ppsD mutation and deficiency in PDIM arising out of this spontaneous mutation.A link between PDIM down-modulation and its function was established when Comp1 exhibited an increased susceptibility to SDS and decreased infectivity in THP-1 cells. The mycobacterial cell wall is characterized by its unusually low permeability to antibiotics, drugs and detergents which is attributed to cell wall lipids including PDIMs [8, 27]. The increased sensitivity of Comp1 to detergent indicates that cell wall permeability was altered and is consistent with the lowered levels of PDIM in this strain. Several roles have been ascribed to PDIM in M. tb virulence, such as involvement in bacterial phagocytosis, preventing phagosomal acidification, conferring protection against reactive nitrogen intermediates and modulating the early immune response to infection [28]. Comp1 bacteria exhibited lower infectivity compared to other strains in the THP-1 cell infection model and this defect may have contributed to its attenuation phenotype. Comp1 bacteria do not exhibit a growth defect during intracellular residence, thereby ruling out growth kinetics as a factor contributing to its attenuation. However, lower infectivity of THP-1 cells suggests a scenario that can explain the attenuation phenotype observed in guinea pigs [16] wherein Comp1 bacteria could be gradually cleared over multiple cycles of infection and result in overall reduced bacterial load. Our previous [16] and present findings are consistent with published reports of virulence attenuation wherein PDIM mutants of M. tb and M. bovis that were attenuated in both lungs and spleen of mice [14, 29\u201331].It is not evident how Comp1 strain acquired a mutation in the PDIM locus. One possibility is that the ppsD mutation arose spontaneously during in vitro culture of Comp1 and its attenuation phenotype was independent of DevR. BLASTN analysis of the ppsD locus containing the G\u279eA SNP at position 4773 of the gene indicated that this nucleotide change was not found in any of the other strains of M. tb complex (taxonomy id: 77643), ruling out an evolutionary basis for this mutation (data not shown) and thereby established its random appearance in the genome of Comp1 strain. The virulence attenuation phenotype of Comp1 was not reversed by animal passage [15], suggesting that the acquired mutation is random and stable. Extended in vitro culturing of M. tb is reportedly associated with a loss in the ability to synthesize PDIM and likely to generate a heterogeneous population of PDIM-positive and -negative bacteria [29, 32]. There are reports in literature of spontaneously arising mutations and deletions in the PDIM biosynthetic pathway, including pps genes, that are associated with PDIM deficiency [9, 29, 33]. Furthermore, numerous studies have demonstrated a direct link between the loss of PDIM and attenuation of virulence in animal models [9, 29].The other 4 gene loci in Comp1 containing non-synonymous SNPs encode an acetyltransferase (Rv0133), a conserved hypothetical gene (Rv0516c), an oxidoreductase (Rv1771) and a PE_PGRS family protein (Rv3514). To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports in the literature of their association with a virulence phenotype. Although the observed virulence attenuation phenotype of Comp1 can be explained by the ppsD mutation and its downstream effects on PDIM production, we do not exclude the possibility that other aspects of bacterial physiology and virulence might have been affected by one or more of the other four mutations detected in Comp1 by genome sequencing. The association of a randomly generated mutation in the PDIM gene cluster of Comp1 bacteria with loss of virulence points to the importance of assessing the PDIM status of M. tb strains while characterizing their virulence properties, especially when the outcomes of genetic analysis are not readily explainable.A functional genomics approach was successfully utilized to identify a spontaneous mutation in ppsD gene belonging to the PDIM cluster which led to down-regulation of PDIM synthesis in M. tb Comp1 bacteria and associated defects in permeability and infectivity. These findings suggest the defect in PDIM levels as a plausible molecular mechanism underlying Comp1 virulence attenuation in guinea pigs.JST is thankful to the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India for providing funding support to undertake a part of the study (BT/PR5142/med/14/542/2004).

Frozen bacterial stocks were sub-cultured twice until logarithmic phase (A595 ~\u20090.4) in Dubos medium containing 0.5% BSA, 0.75% Dextrose, 0.085% NaCl and 0.1% Tween 80 (DTA medium).Table 1\nVirulence characteristics of strains used in the studya\n\naThe data is compiled from our earlier publication [16]. A score of 1 is assigned to all parameters (body weight score etc.) and to the overall virulence index at 13\u2009weeks that were measured during guinea pig infection with H37Rv. The relative scores for other strains are calculated with reference to that of H37Rv. [*** pvalue\u2009<\u20090.001; * pvalue\u2009<\u20090.05]\nTowards deciphering the underlying basis for the attenuation of Comp1, its genome was sequenced. The SNPs in Comp1 obtained by mapping the sequenced reads to M. tb H37Rv genome (NCBI ID: NC_000962) were compared against the reported SNPs [22]. A total of 171 probable SNPs and 21 InDels in Comp1 were detected (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Table S2 and Additional\u00a0file\u00a03: Table S3) and compared with the \u2018erroneous\u2019 sites identified previously [22]. Of these, 57 SNPs and 15 InDels were present in the \u2018erroneous\u2019 variations list and not analyzed further. Among the remaining 114 SNPs, 106 SNPs, as well as all the 6 remaining InDels were previously reported for other M. tb strains (GMVT Database [23]). Based on this comparative analysis with previously reported genome sequences [22, 23], 8 SNPs that were not reported for any M. tb strain, were assumed to be unique to the Comp1 strain (Table\u00a02). Among these 8 SNPs, 5 variants were non-synonymous, which occur in genes corresponding to an oxidoreductase, a polyketide synthase gene ppsD, a gene involved in acetylation, a PE-PGRS57 gene (function unknown) and a conserved hypothetical gene (Table 2). The SNP occurring in the ppsD gene lies within the PDIM locus (Fig.\u00a01a). PpsD is a modular polyketide synthase protein and along with PpsA-E is responsible for the synthesis of the PDIM lipid core. PpsD is an 1827 amino acids-long protein, and the SNP in Comp1 occurs at codon 1591 (TGG\u279eTGA/ W1591\u279eSTOP), and would result in a truncated protein. Furthermore, a premature nonsense codon in ppsD is expected to result in transcriptional polarity and reduced expression of the downstream genes of the fadD26-papA5 operon in Comp1 bacteria.Table 2\nSNPs unique to M. tuberculosis Comp1 straina\n\naThe SNPs unique to Comp1 were identified by comparing the whole genome sequences of Comp1 vs. H37Rv strain\nbN Non-synonymous mutation, S Synonymous mutation\n\n\nFig. 1\nAnalysis of ppsD sequence in M. tb strains. a Schematic representation of the PDIM locus of M. tb H37Rv. b Confirmation of SNP in ppsD gene of Comp1 by PCR amplification and sequencing. *indicates the position 4773 of G\u279eA SNP resulting in a TGA nonsense codon at W1591 (boxed)\nWe next analyzed the expression of PDIM cluster to decipher the effect of ppsD nonsense mutation in Comp1 on expression of the pps locus. The previously published aerobic transcriptome profiles of H37Rv, Mut1 and Comp1 strains (GEO Accession number GSE30264) were found to be broadly similar (Fig.\u00a02a). A decreased expression of several genes belonging to the PDIM cluster in Comp1 was observed (Fig. 2b). Reverse transcriptase-qPCR validation of mRNA confirmed the transcription defect; overall, transcript levels of the PDIM synthesis and transport genes were repressed 3 to 5-fold in the Comp1 strain in comparison to all other strains. Significant perturbation in gene expression was observed in fadD26-papA5 operon which includes the ppsD gene (pvalue ranging between <\u20090.01 and\u2009<\u20090.001) and not in divergently transcribed mas gene sequence and fadD28-mmpl7 operon (Fig. 2b and c). A higher expression of PDIM cluster genes has been previously correlated with the virulence of M. tb strains [8, 9]. Thus, the identification of a ppsD mutation in Comp1 was consistent with lowered expression of PDIM locus and attenuation of this strain.\n\nFig. 2\nDifferential expression of PDIM cluster genes in M. tb Comp1. a Hierarchical clustering of whole transcriptomes of M. tb H37Rv, Mut1 and Comp1.

[**, pvalue\u2009<\u20090.01 and ***, pvalue\u2009<\u20090.001 in comparison to H37Rv]\nTo determine whether the lowered transcription of the PDIM cluster resulted in altered PDIM production, nonpolar surface lipids that incorporated 14C-propionate or 14C-acetate were extracted from M. tb strains and analyzed by TLC. 14C-propionate labelling is commonly used to assess the synthesis of branched lipids including PDIMs in M. tb [24]. Comp1 exhibited an ~\u2009115-fold defect in the incorporation of 14C-propionate with respect to M. tb H37Rv (pvalue\u2009<\u20090.001; Fig.\u00a03a and Additional\u00a0file\u00a04: Table S4), which pointed to a possible defect in PDIM synthesis. Next, the cultures were labelled with 14C-acetate to rule out a generalized defect in lipid synthesis; no significant difference was observed in incorporation of acetate label in Comp1 and other strains (Fig. 3b). These findings indicate that Comp1 has a severe and specific defect in the synthesis of PDIM virulence lipids.\n\nFig. 3\nAnalysis of apolar lipids by radioactive labeling. a Apolar lipids of M. tb strains analyzed by 14C-propionate labeling. b Total lipids of M. tb strains analyzed by labelling with 14C-actetate. Equal counts were loaded onto TLC and detected by phosphorimaging except in case of 14C-propionate labelled lipids of Comp1 where labelling was defective\nPDIM-less mutants were earlier shown to be more sensitive to SDS than the wild type strain. This phenotype is consistent with alterations in the cell wall structure and an increase in cell wall permeability [8]. In order to determine whether the PDIM synthesis defect in Comp1 bacteria was associated with a functional defect, we assessed the permeability of Comp1 bacteria exposed to SDS. While a rapid decrease in the number of viable bacteria was observed for all the strains, Comp1 bacteria treated with SDS (0.05 and 0.1%) were significantly more sensitive to detergent (Fig.\u00a04; pvalue\u2009<\u20090.05). These findings demonstrated that PDIM deficiency was associated with an increased cell wall permeability in Comp1 bacteria.\n\nFig. 4\nIn vitro susceptibility of M. tb strains to SDS. Viability of various M. tb strains in the presence of SDS. The solid lines represent the untreated cultures and the dotted lines represent SDS-treated cultures.

Therefore, we assessed the infectivity and intracellular survival of various M. tb strains in the THP-1 cell infection model. Comp1 exhibited a defect in intracellular survival in comparison to H37Rv (pvalue\u2009<\u20090.001; Fig.\u00a05a). Moreover, Comp1 bacteria displayed a reduced albeit non-significant ability to infect THP-1 cells in comparison to H37Rv, Mut1 and other Comp strains (Fig. 5b, pvalue\u2009=\u20090.1). Taking together these findings and previously published observations [25], the attenuation of Comp1 in guinea pigs could be ascribed, at least in part, to compromised infectivity of PDIM deficient bacteria.\n\nFig. 5\nIntracellular survival and infectivity of M. tb strains. a Intracellular survival of M. tb strains in THP-1 infection model. Intracellular bacteria were recovered from THP-1 cells by lysis at various time points and bacterial survival was determined by CFU analysis. b Infectivity of M. tb strains in THP-1 cells analyzed after infection.

LncRNA\u2019s functional versatility includes epigenetic modification, nuclear domain organization, transcriptional control, regulation of RNA splicing and translation, and modulation of protein activity. However, most lncRNAs remain uncharacterized due to a shortage of predictive tools available to guide functional experiments.To address this gap for lymphoma-associated lncRNAs identified in our studies, we developed a new computational method, Predicting LncRNA Activity through Integrative Data-driven \u2018Omics and Heuristics (PLAIDOH), which has several unique features not found in other methods. PLAIDOH integrates transcriptome, subcellular localization, enhancer landscape, genome architecture, chromatin interaction, and RNA-binding (eCLIP) data and generates statistically defined output scores. PLAIDOH\u2019s approach identifies and ranks functional connections between individual lncRNA, coding gene, and protein pairs using enhancer, transcript cis-regulatory, and RNA-binding protein interactome scores that predict the relative likelihood of these different lncRNA functions. When applied to \u2018omics datasets that we collected from lymphoma patients, or to publicly available cancer (TCGA) or ENCODE datasets, PLAIDOH identified and prioritized well-known lncRNA-target gene regulatory pairs (e.g., HOTAIR and HOX genes, PVT1 and MYC), validated hits in multiple lncRNA-targeted CRISPR screens, and lncRNA-protein binding partners (e.g., NEAT1 and NONO). Importantly, PLAIDOH also identified novel putative functional interactions, including one lymphoma-associated lncRNA based on analysis of data from our human lymphoma study. We validated PLAIDOH\u2019s predictions for this lncRNA using knock-down and knock-out experiments in lymphoma cell models.Our study demonstrates that we have developed a new method for the prediction and ranking of functional connections between individual lncRNA, coding gene, and protein pairs, which were validated by genetic experiments and comparison to published CRISPR screens. PLAIDOH expedites validation and follow-on mechanistic studies of lncRNAs in any biological system. It is available at https://github.com/sarahpyfrom/PLAIDOH.Long non-coding RNAs exhibit remarkable cell type specificity and disease association, yet the vast majority remain uncharacterized. Transcribed pervasively across the genome, they are defined by only two characteristics: length greater than 200\u2009bp and lacking protein coding potential [1]. The diversity of lncRNAs is therefore extremely broad: from a few hundred bases to many kilobases in size; single exon to many exons; present in a wide range of locations ranging from intergenic, intronic, overlapping coding exons, and anti-sense to within coding genes [2]. LncRNAs exhibit much less conservation between species compared to coding genes and structure-function relationships have yet to be defined [3]. A major obstacle to functional discovery is the paucity of established rules and algorithms for functional prediction, and the lack of sequence conservation or homology across species further limits the potential for in silico screening or prioritization for experimental studies [4]. For these reasons, the study of lncRNAs remains challenging.Despite these challenges, some lncRNAs have been shown to play key roles in a broad range of biological processes via an impressive variety of mechanisms. Reported functions range from cis- or trans-regulation of neighboring or distal genes via recruitment or sequestering of epigenetic or transcriptional protein complexes [5, 6]; regulation of chromatin structure and 3D nuclear organization [7\u20139]; regulation of translation via direct binding to mRNAs [8, 10\u201312]; and modulation of cellular signaling via protein scaffolding [2, 12]. LncRNAs play roles in diverse essential biological processes, including development (e.g., XIST, H19) [6, 13\u201318], immune response (e.g., NRON, Morrbid), [5, 12, 19], and oncogenesis (MALAT1, MEG3) [4, 6, 10, 11, 20]. LncRNAs also have potential clinical utility as disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets, especially in cancer [10, 11].In pursuit of novel gene regulatory mechanisms that are altered in human Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) [21], we identified hundreds of annotated and novel lncRNAs that are significantly altered in primary NHL compared to normal control B cell samples sorted from tonsils and peripheral blood. We next sought to select the most potentially lymphomagenic lncRNAs for targeted, mechanistic experiments. However, prioritization and selection a small number of lncRNAs proved challenging due to the aforementioned paucity of information regarding function. There are a few bioinformatic tools available for lncRNA analysis and functional prediction [22\u201325]. However, each has disadvantages including: being based entirely on motif predictions; having limited options for customization to end-user priorities; and no integration of lncRNA-associated data into a calculated score that can be ranked. Therefore, we sought to design a new bioinformatic method that would 1) integrate diverse types of -omics data in ways relevant to lncRNA function; 2) be flexible to incorporate user-provided or publicly available datasets in any combination; 3) generate a statistically ranked output; 4) be robust even for smaller datasets, as these are more common and more challenging to analyze; 5) enable users to customize prioritization and ranking metrics to answer specific questions and for selection of top hits for downstream experiments. We named our method PLAIDOH, for Predicting LncRNA Activity through Integrative Data-driven \u2018Omics and Heuristics.PLAIDOH is a new method with modular algorithms that calculate predictive scores based on several different measures of transcriptional regulatory control, protein interaction, and subcellular localization. PLAIDOH integrates transcriptome, subcellular localization, enhancer landscape, genome architecture, chromatin interaction, and RNA-binding data, generating statistically-defined output scores to rank functional connections between individual lncRNA, coding gene, and protein pairs. When applied to \u2018omics datasets that we collected from Washington University lymphoma patients [21], or to publicly available cancer (TCGA) [26, 27] or ENCODE datasets [1, 28], PLAIDOH accurately identified and prioritized well-known lncRNA-target gene regulatory pairs (e.g., HOTAIR and HOX genes, PVT1 and MYC) [29\u201335], positive hits in a CRISPRi lncRNA growth screen [28], and lncRNA-protein binding partners (e.g., NEAT1 and NONO) [36]. Importantly, PLAIDOH also identified novel putative functional interactions, including one lymphoma-associated lncRNA based on analysis of data from our human Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma study [21, 37]. We validated PLAIDOH\u2019s predictions for this lncRNA using knock-down and knock-out experiments in lymphoma cell models. In summary, we show that PLAIDOH fills an important void with a facile method to predict the function of lncRNAs in a variety of systems, and to accelerate validation and follow-on experimental studies to better characterize lncRNAs.Similar to previous reports [1, 38], we found that putative novel single exon lncRNA transcripts are abundant, representing 74% (191,762 of 259,429 unique transcripts detected) (Additional file 1: Figure S1A). However, these novel unspliced transcripts exhibit very low expression (mean FPKM 0.18) compared to novel multi-exon spliced transcripts (mean FPKM 7.3) or annotated (known) single or multi-exon lncRNA transcripts (mean FPKM 10.98) (Additional file 1: Figure S1B). In addition, single exon transcript expression was inconsistently detected across samples: only 10% of transcripts were detected in 10% or more of samples; 80% of novel unspliced transcripts were detected in only 1 sample. In contrast, 60% of annotated lncRNA transcripts were detected in more than 10% of samples, and nearly 90% of protein coding gene transcripts were detected in at least 10% of samples (Additional file 1: Figure S1C). We reasoned that experimental study of lncRNAs with very low expression levels or those detected in <\u200910% of samples would be challenging, and of questionable relevance to the majority of patients with lymphoma. Moreover, some studies have suggested that spliced, multi-exon lncRNAs may be more likely than unspliced lncRNAs to play defined roles in cellular homeostasis [39]. For these reasons, we focused on multi-exon spliced lncRNAs for subsequent analyses.We next sought to identify potentially lymphomagenic lncRNAs for targeted mechanistic studies in lymphoma models. Expression in lymphoma compared to normal B cell samples revealed 1464 significantly altered RNAs (log2 fold change >\u20091, FDR\u2009<\u20090.05). These were distributed among coding mRNA, annotated lncRNA, and novel spliced lncRNA (Fig. 1c).The novel spliced lncRNAs exhibited a larger difference in mean fold change and higher average expression level (Fig. 1d and Additional file 1: Figure S1B). These significantly altered coding genes were enriched in immune response and immune signaling, transcriptional regulation, and cell cycle pathways, consistent with our previous analyses of Follicular Lymphoma [21]. The same enrichment analysis cannot be performed for lncRNAs because databases of lncRNA functions and pathways do not yet exist in standardized forms, and therefore lncRNA gene symbols are generally not included in the output from ontology and pathway annotation tools.Next, we calculated the Spearman correlation coefficient and adjusted p value for each lncRNA-coding gene pair (LCP) within 400\u2009kb on either side of each lncRNA across all samples. We observed that a greater number of LCPs located close together (<\u20095\u2009kb) had significant expression correlation (adj p\u00a0<\u20090.05) compared to those located further apart (Fig. 3b, Additional file 3: Figure S2C). As expected, the expression correlation of LCPs containing antisense or coding-gene overlapping lncRNAs had more significant p values as compared to distal, though a subset of these distal LCPs showed a highly significant correlation, suggesting they may have a regulatory role (Additional file 3: Figure S2D).A large proportion of lncRNAs are known to overlap with enhancer elements and some have been shown to be involved with enhancer-mediated transcriptional control [1, 2, 5]. Location of a lncRNA gene within 1\u2009kb of a FANTOM enhancer has recently been shown to be significantly associated with lncRNAs that modified cell growth upon CRISPRi targeting [28]. Consistent with these and other reports, we observed an increase in the average expression level of lncRNAs located close to FANTOM enhancers, for both positively and negatively correlated LCPs (Fig. 3c). We also observed that a greater number of LCPs located close to FANTOM enhancers (<\u2009100\u2009kb) had significant expression correlation (adj p\u00a0<\u20090.05) compared to those located further away from enhancers (Fig. 3d).Super-enhancers (SE) are dense clusters of very active enhancers that drive the transcription of genes involved in cell identity [41]. LncRNAs associated with SE have been linked to key developmental processes and master transcription factors in hematopoietic, cardiac, and embryonic stem cells [42\u201346]. Therefore, we reasoned that lncRNA expression level may be correlated with co-localization with SEs. However, we found no enrichment of lncRNAs located within SEs compared to conventional enhancers. In fact, conventional enhancers harbored significantly more lncRNAs per kb than SEs (Additional file 4: Figure S3A). Moreover, we found no difference in expression between lncRNAs within SEs compared to those in conventional enhancers, but those not in enhancers had significantly higher expression (Additional file 4: Figure S3B). We next separated lncRNAs into those that are intergenic (do not overlap a coding gene) and those that are intragenic (at least 1 base pair overlap with a coding gene). This separation demonstrates that lncRNAs that are not located within any enhancer, but do overlap a coding gene, exhibited significantly higher expression levels compared to any other group. This group of intragenic, non-enhancer lncRNAs includes lncRNAs entirely encompassed within introns as well as anti-sense lncRNAs (Additional file 4: Figure S3C).We next reasoned that quantitative measurement of regulatory activity would provide additional metrics by which to rank lncRNAs by transcriptional control capacity. To discriminate transcriptional regulation by enhancers overlapping lncRNA gene loci from regulation mediated by lncRNA transcripts themselves, we incorporated chromatin landscape and genome architecture metrics for the region surrounding each lncRNA locus (400\u2009kb). For enhancer activity, we included chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data (ChIP-seq) for H3K4me1 and H3K27ac, which are histone modifications associated with all enhancers or active enhancers, respectively, and for H3K4Me3, which marks active promoters. The p values (\u2212log10) for ChIP-seq peaks overlapping lncRNA genes were used as a measure of normalized enhancer activity [47, 48]. As expected, for the activating H3K4me3 and H3K27ac marks, higher activity was associated with increased lncRNA expression, especially for H3K4me3, while little effect on expression was observed for the H3K4me1 modification, which marks both active and inactive enhancers (Additional file 4: Figure S3D). In contrast, there was little to no effect of epigenetic activity on the expression correlation between LCPs (Additional file 4: Figure S3E). Taken together, these results suggest that enhancer activity, as well as proximity to enhancers and coding genes, contribute to lncRNA expression level but do not provide sufficient information to predict lncRNA function, and therefore additional information was needed.Enhancers often regulate gene expression by direct physical interaction with target gene promoters via transcriptional control proteins (activators, repressors, transcription factors, epigenetic modifiers). This interactive conformation is referred to as chromatin looping or genome architecture and can be measured by Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing (ChIA-PET) [40, 49\u201352]. ChIA-PET interaction scores [49, 52] reflect the relative frequency of the interaction between two genomic fragments, bound by an immunoprecipitated protein. As shown in Additional file 5: Figure S4A and B, there is a relative enrichment of POL2RA ChIA-positive LCPs with higher ChIA scores among those that are located more closely in genomic space, as would be expected. In addition, there are a greater number of LCPs with significant expression correlations (Spearman adjusted p-values <\u20090.05) located close together Additional file 5: Figure S4C).To modulate transcription of another gene, a lncRNA must be located in the nucleus. On the other hand, post-transcriptional regulation or functions unrelated to gene expression (e.g., regulation of mRNA translation, modulation of protein signaling activity, etc.) require cytoplasmic localization. Therefore, PLAIDOH incorporates data from subcellular fractionation RNA-seq [1] to calculate nuclear:cytoplasmic ratios of total RNA transcript for each lncRNA. We selected this data source because it provided subcellular localization for a larger number of lncRNAs than another database [53] and because the data is derived from the same cell types used in our analyses (ENCODE cell lines, B cells). We observed a trend toward higher correlation coefficient values with higher nuclear:cytoplasmic ratios, though again only for the positively correlated LCPs (Additional file 5: Figure S4D). These results underscore that multiple mechanisms contribute to transcriptional control, and therefore PLAIDOH integrates data from each of them to make functional predictions for individual lncRNAs.Next, we sought to identify individual lncRNAs that are significantly more correlated with a single coding gene compared to all others in the 400\u2009kb flanking regions. We identified such \u201coutliers\u201d by calculating the Z-scores of the Spearman correlation of each LCP for a given lncRNA, to identify those with the correlation that most deviates from the rest of the LCPs. Plotting these by genomic distance from the lncRNA visually highlights those with the highest Z-scores (Fig. 4c); two examples are shown in Fig. 4d. Among many coding genes in its 400\u2009kb neighborhood, LINC01431 is significantly correlated only with nearby NXT1. The two genes are transcribed from the opposite strands such that their 3\u2032 ends are within 2\u2009kb, but they do not overlap or share a promoter/TSS. NXT1 codes for an essential nuclear transport factor involved in the export of mRNA and small RNA molecules from the nucleus [58, 59]. Strong correlation with a single coding gene is not limited to those located close together, however. Another lncRNA, RP11-420A23.1, is significantly correlated only with PLK4, which is located 391\u2009kb away. PLK4 codes for Polo-like Kinase 4, one of a family of serine-threonine kinases that regulates centriole duplication during mitosis and is a target of inhibitors currently in Phase III clinical trials for AML [60, 61]. Thus, this feature of PLAIDOH analysis can identify highly specific and differential correlative relationships between lncRNAs and coding genes that may indicate transcriptional control of a single coding gene.In Fig. 5c-h, we highlight examples of cancer-specific and cancer-recurrent LCPs. The cancer-specific pattern is exemplified in the STAG1 locus, in which three of four genes within the 800\u2009kb window are significantly correlated with AC096992.2 in AML (Fig. 5c). STAG1 is a ubiquitously expressed component of the cohesin complex that stabilizes topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries with CTCF [62]. Mutations in STAG1 and other cohesin complex genes are recurrent in AML [63]; cohesin dysfunction leads to alterations in gene regulation that contribute to leukemogenesis [64]. NCK1 is adaptor protein that is downstream of receptor tyrosine kinase and STAT3 signaling; both NCK1 and the other correlated gene, SLC35G2, may be involved in colorectal cancer pathogenesis [65, 66]. AC096992.2 exhibits much higher expression in AML (Fig. 5d) and is more highly correlated with neighboring genes in AML compared to the other cancer types (Fig. 5e). This effect was not due to generally higher expression of all of the neighboring genes in AML compared to the other cancer types (Additional file 6: Figure S5C), and levels of nearby active and enhancer-associated histone marks H3K27ac and H3K4me1 were not consistently higher in AML compared to the other tumors (Additional file 6: Figure S5D). These results suggest that lncRNA AC096992.2 itself may play a cis-regulatory role in the transcription of multiple neighboring genes.The cancer-recurrent pattern for an LCP is exemplified in the EVI2/ADAP2 17q11.2 locus (Fig. 5f-h), which is associated with Neurofibromatosis type 1 microdeletion syndrome, a severe phenotype with overgrowth and increased neurofibromas [67, 68]. Of the 9 coding genes and one other lncRNA in this locus, expression of AC138207.5 is significantly correlated with ADAP2 in all five cancer types, and with EVI2A/B in most of the five cancer types (Fig. 5f-g). ADAP2 is a ubiquitously expressed GTPase activating protein for ARF6 that acts as a scaffold in innate immune and membrane inositol phosphate signaling pathways [69\u201371]. EVI2A and EVI2B are named for being ecotropic viral integration sites; EVI2B expression is altered in some types of AML and is a regulator of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell and myeloid differentiation [72]. These results suggest that lncRNA AC138207.5, which exhibits robust expression across the five cancer types (Fig. 5h), may play a cis-regulatory role in the transcription of multiple neighboring genes in diverse cancer types. We note that this feature of PLAIDOH could also be used for customized comparisons between user-provided experimental groups (e.g., tumor:normal, treated:control, developmental stages, or time points).Up to this point, we have evaluated the contribution of discrete transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that may be part of lncRNA function. Our next step was to integrate these distinct measures into a unified predictive model. Therefore, we devised two scores designed to reflect the relative evidence of enhancer- or lncRNA transcript-mediated (\u201ccis\u201d) transcriptional control. The Enhancer score incorporates data from measures of transcriptional control by enhancer regulatory elements: overlapping enhancer-associated H3K4me1 and active enhancer-associated H3K27ac levels for each lncRNA, and the presence and relative strength of chromatin looping between the lncRNA and the coding gene pair as measured by ChIA-PET [49, 52] (see Methods). The lncRNA transcript cis-regulatory score gives greater weight to data associated with the lncRNA transcript itself. This score is calculated from the adjusted p-value of the Spearman LCP correlation, the level of overlapping promoter-associated H3K4me3 activity, and the fraction of lncRNA transcript localized in the nucleus (see Methods).When both scores are plotted together on an XY graph, the score cutoffs define 4 quadrants, with distinct potential functional interactions for the LCPs within them (Fig. 6c & f, and Additional file 7: Figure S6C,F,I,L). For all datasets, the vast majority of LCPs (84.2\u201389.5%) cluster in quadrant one, with low scores for both enhancer and lncRNA transcript cis-regulatory function and the lowest median expression levels for lncRNA and coding genes (0.05\u20130.23 and 1.36\u20133.36 FPKM, respectively). These results suggest that, for the majority of potential lncRNA coding gene pairs, the coding gene\u2019s transcription is not controlled by either the lncRNA or its overlapping enhancer. Quadrant two contains far fewer LCPs (3.43\u20138.01%), and is defined by high enhancer scores, low transcript cis-regulatory scores, and relatively higher median lncRNA and coding gene transcript levels (0.25\u20130.65 and 5.02\u20136.59 FPKM, respectively). Location of an LCP in quadrant two suggests that transcriptional control of the paired coding gene may be mediated through the lncRNA\u2019s overlapping enhancer element, and that lncRNA transcripts here may function via epigenetic mechanisms, e.g. recruitment of chromatin modifiers and/or facilitating chromatin looping. Indeed, several lncRNAs known to act via such epigenetic cis-regulatory control of coding gene partners are located in quadrant two (LINC00263\u2014SCD, PVT1\u2014MYC, and PANDAR/lincRNA-p21--CDKN1A Figs.\u00a06c & f) [28, 35, 77]. Quadrant three is defined by high scores for both enhancer and lncRNA transcript cis-regulatory control, contains the fewest LCPs (1.35\u20133.06%), has the highest median lncRNA expression and nearly the highest coding gene expression (0.43\u20131.34 and 5.26\u20137.23 FPKM, respectively). Thus, quadrant three may represent the strongest regulatory relationships between lncRNAs and the paired coding genes, with evidence for both enhancer-mediated and transcript-mediated cis-regulatory mechanisms, resulting in relatively higher expression of both groups (e.g., PTPRG-AS1\u2014PTPRG, KLHL6-AS1\u2014KLHL6 Figs. 6c & f. Finally, 2.8\u20136.0% of LCPs are located in quadrant four, which is defined by a high lncRNA transcript cis-regulatory score, a low enhancer score, and relatively lower median expression levels for both lncRNAs and coding genes (0.3\u20131.1 and 2.9\u20134.5 FPKM, respectively). Location in this quadrant may indicate that, independent of enhancer augmentation, lncRNA cis-regulatory control may be possible, albeit with relatively lower target coding gene expression levels. The predictive power of assignment to quadrant four is validated by lncRNAs known to regulate expression of coding gene pairs via transcript-mediated cis-regulatory mechanisms, including HOTAIR\u2014HOX genes [29\u201334] and XIST/JPX/FTX--CHIC1 [73\u201376]. Thus, PLAIDOH integrates global measures of transcriptional control to calculate scores that predict the relative likelihood of distinct cis-regulatory control mechanisms, which are consistent with published reports for many lncRNAs as shown here.To further test how well PLAIDOH\u2019s predictions of transcriptional regulatory function coincide with lncRNAs\u2019 experimentally-defined function, we compared PLAIDOH\u2019s Enhancer and lncRNA Transcript cis-regulatory scores with the results of several published CRISPR lncRNA screens. Each screen used a different CRISPR approach: knock-down (CRISPR-KRAB), knock-out, and activating (CRISPR-CaLR) [28, 78, 79]. The knock-down and KO screens used readouts of cell proliferation/growth as readouts, while the activating CRISPR screen used susceptibility to AraC (alkylating chemotherapeutic agent). Thus, these screens identified lncRNAs that affect cell growth (or cell growth in the setting of AraC treatment), while PLAIDOH identifies lncRNAs that modulate the expression of other genes (LCPs) or interact with RNA-binding proteins, regardless of their effect on cell growth. Additional file 8: Figure S7A shows that, overall, PLAIDOH\u2019s Enhancer and lncRNA Transcript cis-regulatory scores are significantly higher in hits compared to non-hits for the CRISPR-KRAB screen. The significant difference in both enhancer and transcript-mediated regulatory scores is not surprising given that the KRAB knock-down is mediated via suppressive epigenetic marks targeted to the lncRNA region, and therefore would likely suppress both lncRNA transcription and enhancer activity [28]. Overall, these results suggest that lncRNAs with higher PLAIDOH scores may be more likely to have functional cellular effects when suppressed.Next, we compared to validated lncRNA hits from the CRISPR KO [78] and activating screens [79] (Additional file 8: Figure S7B&C). Of the validated lncRNAs with sufficient data for PLAIDOH analysis, the majority had PLAIDOH Enhancer or Transcript Cis-Regulatory scores above the cutoffs: 11/15 (73.3%) from the CRISPRa screen and 9/14 (64.3%) from the CRISPR KO screen. Further confirmation of PLAIDOH\u2019s prioritization scores is evidenced by several validated anti-sense (AS) lncRNAs in the CRISPRa screen. For all but one (RERG-AS1), PLAIDOH\u2019s scores were above the cutoffs for Enhancer or Transcript cis-regulation (Quadrant 2 or 4, respectively), and the highest scores were for the matched coding gene. The low (Quadrant 1) score for RERG-AS1--RERG was due to low expression levels in both the lncRNA and the coding gene (0.0036 and 0.014 FPKM) and lack of overlapping active chromatin marks, though there is a high scoring CHIA interaction. Taken together, these results suggest that the lncRNAs\u2019 effects on cell growth may be mediated through modulation of the expression of nearby coding genes, which were identified by PLAIDOH.During PLAIDOH\u2019s development, we compared it to other available lncRNA analysis methods and tools. Because lncRNAs are still a relatively new class of genes, many of the available tools were limited to processing and analyzing RNA-seq data, identifying and annotating known and novel lncRNA transcripts [23, 80, 81]. In contrast, we designed PLAIDOH to address the functional knowledge gap for lncRNAs by analyzing transcriptome, epigenome, 3D-genome interaction, cellular localization, and RBP-lncRNA interactome data to make functional predictions for lncRNAs. Thus, here we will compare PLAIDOH to other informatic tools or methods that perform similar analyses. One of these, called lncRNA-screen, comprises a pipeline that processes RNA-seq data to identify known and novel lncRNAs, and integrates ChIP-seq and Hi-C data [24]. Like PLAIDOH, lncRNA-screen outputs a table of data related to each lncRNA. However, the table contains discrete data only; there is no integration into a predictive or rankable score as PLAIDOH calculates. Also, like PLAIDOH, lncRNA-screen generates graphical output, but in the form of heatmaps and genome snapshots, which are useful for a global overview or for visualization of a specific locus. Again, these graphical outputs do not display prioritize lncRNAs by individual metrics or integrated scores, nor do they compare potential functions of individual lncRNAs side-by-side. By contrast, PLAIDOH generates two types of cis-regulatory score for individual lncRNA-coding gene pairs, as well as analyzing and integrating RNA-binding protein interactome data (described further below). Direct comparison of a specific example, lncRNA CTD-2006C1.2, shows that lncRNA-screen and PLAIDOH both identified ZNF44 and ZNH439 as potential cis-regulatory targets. However, PLAIDOH provides individual cis-regulatory scores for each LCP (18.7 and 26.6, respectively) and also identifies another coding gene, ZNF20, with a higher cis-regulatory score (27.7) and stronger expression correlation (rho\u2009=\u20090.849, adj p\u00a0<\u20092.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910^-16).Another group developed an analytical approach that combined methods to predict lncRNA regulatory networks [22]. The Pan-cancer analysis of the tumors in TCGA integrated transcriptome and eCLIP data with transcription factor and lncRNA binding motifs, to predict lncRNA regulatory networks and categories of lncRNA function (transcriptional, post-transcriptional, or both). Unlike PLAIDOH, the Pan-cancer method does not incorporate epigenome data, which would provide direct evidence of regulatory activity near or overlapping lncRNAs. The Pan-cancer method predicts many regulatory targets for individual lncRNAs, and these targets can be located anywhere in the genome. PLAIDOH also identifies multiple targets of individual lncRNAs but focuses on 800\u2009kb genomic windows for transcriptional regulatory relationships and provides rankable scores for each pair to enable prioritization. Because of these differences in the outputs of the Pan-cancer analysis and PLAIDOH, we focused our comparison on lncRNAs ranked highly by the former, and, in some cases, validated by siRNA knock-down [22]. Of 43 lncRNAs predicted to regulate gene expression in TCGA cancers by Pan-cancer, 31 had high PLAIDOH Enhancer and/or lncRNA transcript cis-regulatory scores (72.1%, Additional file 8: Figure S7D). These concordant results demonstrate that, while the Pan-cancer method and PLAIDOH incorporate different approaches, there is substantial overlap in highly ranked lncRNAs.Taken together, comparison of PLAIDOH to lncRNA CRISPR screens or to other analytical methods or tools demonstrates that PLAIDOH\u2019s predictive transcriptional regulatory scores are corroborated by these orthogonal approaches. Moreover, PLAIDOH has some unique features that provide the user with functionality not yet found in other tools/methods.To enable prioritization of lncRNAs, we next integrated additional quantitative data, including lncRNA and RBP expression levels, number of RBPs bound per lncRNA (a measure of specificity), and number of RBP binding sites per kb of spliced lncRNA (a potential measure of binding strength, normalized for lncRNA size) for more granular ranking of lncRNA-RBP pairs. Figure 7b demonstrates how this approach can stratify lncRNA \u2013 RBP pairs by lncRNA and RBP expression, RBP binding site density, and co-localization in the same subcellular fraction. The effectiveness of this method is confirmed by accurate stratification of several lncRNA-RBP partners, including highly expressed lncRNA NEAT1 with two different paraspeckle proteins (NONO and SFPQ) [36, 83], all co-localized in the nucleus; the moderately expressed telomerase lncRNA TERC with a relatively high number of RBP sites per kb for the telomerase complex-associated protein, dyskerin (DKC1), which are co-localized in the nucleus [84]; and the moderately expressed lncRNA HG19, which has relative few RBP binding sites per kb and acts as a molecular scaffold to facilitate effective association of K homology-type splicing regulatory protein (KHSRP) with labile transcripts [85], both of which co-localize in the cytoplasm. These results validate PLAIDOH\u2019s approach, and demonstrate that these integrative analyses enable filtering and prioritization of lncRNAs based on relevant biological and experimental data related to lncRNA - RBP interactomes.To further validate PLAIDOH\u2019s lncRNA-RBP interactome analyses, we compared to CRISPR screen hits that had validated growth phenotypes but low PLAIDOH cis-regulatory scores (Additional file 8: Figure S7B). RBP-interactome analysis shows that some of these lncRNAs may function via interactions with RNA-binding proteins in non-transcriptional pathways (e.g., RNAi, ribosome biogenesis, splicing) as indicated by PLAIDOH analysis of RBP binding, expression levels, and subcellular localization of these lncRNA-protein partners (Additional file 9: Figure S8).We next sought to determine where RP11-960\u2009L18.1 transcript is localized, given that cytoplasmic localization is associated with non-transcriptional lncRNA functions. Subcellular fraction RNA-seq data showed that a greater fraction of RP11-960\u2009L18.1 transcript was located in the cytoplasm [1]. Since the RNA-seq data was from normal B cells, we confirmed it in lymphoma B cell lines (HBL1, U2932) by subcellular fractionation and qRT-PCR of cytoplasmic, nuclear, nucleoplasm, and chromatin-associated fractions. As shown in Fig. 8e, RP11-960\u2009L18.1 is predominantly localized to the cytoplasm. For comparison, control mRNA GAPDH is predominantly localized to the cytoplasm and the CTCF-associated noncoding RNA JPX is enriched in the nuclear and chromatin-associated fractions [75, 87]. We next evaluated the RBP interactome of RP11-960\u2009L18.1 using PLAIDOH and our primary human NHL RNA-seq data integrated with eCLIP-seq data [21, 82]. This approach revealed that RP11-960\u2009L18.1 interacts with a small number of RBPs, including ILF3/NF90, KHDRBS1/SAM68, and PUM2, all of which are highly expressed in the NHL samples (FPKM 14.6\u201326.4) and also localize to the cytoplasm (Fig. 8f). Supporting these results, RBP motif scans showed 9 KHDRBS1/SAM68 motifs in the RP11-960\u2009L18.1 transcript sequence, all within 300\u2009bp of the 3\u2032 end of the molecule [88]. The evidence for binding to both SAM68 and PUM2 is intriguing, since interaction with both of these RBPs was recently reported for NORAD, noncoding RNA activated by DNA damage, another predominantly cytoplasmic lncRNA. SAM68 and PUM2 promote genome stability and cell cycle progression, contributing to cell proliferation [89\u201391]. Data from the eCLIP studies also show that RP11-960\u2009L18.1 has 11 binding sites for ILF3/NF90, which is highly expressed in the NHL samples (average 26.4 FPKM). NF90 is a dsRNA binding protein that forms complexes with several other proteins in different contexts to regulate gene expression, stabilize mRNAs, and promote cell growth and proliferation in embryonic stem cells as well as cancer cells [92\u201394]. Taken together, these results suggest that RP11-960\u2009L18.1 is a cytoplasmic lncRNA that may function via interactions with cytoplasmic protein(s) to promote the growth and proliferation of B lymphocytes.In summary, our studies describe how our methods can identify lncRNAs that are significantly dysregulated in human lymphoma, as compared to normal B cells. To predict their function and prioritize these dysregulated lncRNAs for experimental studies, we developed PLAIDOH, an integrative, data-driven approach to accelerate lncRNA prioritization for functional studies, a heretofore highly manual process. We demonstrate that PLAIDOH accurately predicted and prioritized known lncRNA- coding gene or -RNA binding protein interactions and, importantly, predicted a novel lncRNA function that was confirmed by experimental studies in lymphoma cell models. Thus, PLAIDOH fills an unmet need in the study of lncRNAs: a flexible, accessible method for prediction and ranking of functional roles and specific targets of lncRNAs, expediting the transition to focused experimental follow-up studies.LncRNAs have emerged as a new frontier of biological molecules with enormous potential for increasing our understanding of disease mechanisms and providing new therapeutic targets. CRISPRi screens and focused mechanistic studies have begun to assign function to a small number of lncRNAs, but the vast majority remain functionally uncharacterized. A major obstacle to functional discovery is the relative lack of established rules or algorithms for functional prediction and prioritization for experimental studies. After identifying hundreds of lncRNAs significantly altered in human lymphoma samples, we encountered this obstacle in attempting to prioritize the lncRNAs for focused experimental studies. Therefore, we developed a bioinformatic analysis pipeline with modular algorithms that integrates diverse types of \u2018omics datasets (transcriptome, epigenome, 3D-genome, protein interactome) and generates statistically ranked output scores based on several different measures of activity level, transcriptional regulatory control, and protein interaction for selection of top hits for targeted, mechanistic experiments.PLAIDOH has several unique features that provide the user with functionality not yet found in other tools. PLAIDOH uses only experimental data in its algorithms, which is in contrast to other approaches that rely partially or wholly on binding or motif predictions [22, 95]. We chose to focus on experimental data because the results of binding prediction algorithms have not been extensively validated and their inclusion vastly increases the number of potential lncRNA interactions, which decreases statistical power for analyses of smaller and/or heterogeneous datasets, such as our NHL patient samples. For transcriptional control analyses, PLAIDOH focuses on coding genes within 400\u2009kb flanking the lncRNA, though we would note that this genome window is customizable. We chose this approach because most lncRNAs with transcriptional regulatory function characterized to date act in cis [2, 11, 39]. Unlike most other methods [23, 24, 80], PLAIDOH integrates multiple measures of transcriptional control to differentiate enhancer-mediated and lncRNA transcript-mediated cis-regulatory mechanisms. These measures include ChIP-seq for histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and H3K4me1), which enable quantitative measurement of regulatory element activity [48], and ChIA-PET, which quantitatively measures the genomic interaction of lncRNAs with target gene loci [49, 52]. By calculating independent scores for overlapping enhancer activity and lncRNA transcript cis-regulatory activity, PLAIDOH successfully distinguishes these distinct mechanisms of transcriptional control, as demonstrated by identifying known lncRNA-target coding gene interactions such as PVT1--MYC, HOTAIR--HOX genes, and lincRNA-p21(PANDAR)\u2014CDKN1A [29\u201334, 77].LncRNAs also act in trans in a range of cellular processes, including mRNA splicing, protein translation, and cellular signaling via direct binding to other RNAs or by acting as scaffolds or guides for proteins and protein complexes [2, 11, 96]. Prediction of these functional classes is the most challenging since most \u2018omics data (e.g., RNA-seq) does not capture these interactions. Indeed, while binding prediction, co-expression, or network analysis methods may indicate apparent relationships between the lncRNA and target RNAs or proteins, these are indirect measures at best, and their large number of potential interactions may lead to decreased statistical power for smaller datasets. We therefore incorporated eCLIP-seq data for lncRNA \u2013 protein interactome analyses of ENCODE cell lines. These RBP immunoprecipitation studies were extensively validated by shRNA knockdown and controlled for antibody specificity; RBP subcellular localization was determined using the validated antibodies [82]. Integration of eCLIP-seq data with corollary lncRNA expression and localization data enabled prioritization by co-localization, binding specificity, and expression, identifying both literature-supported and novel lncRNA-RBP interactions. Using only eCLIP-seq data for PLAIDOH\u2019s protein interactome input does have the disadvantage of selection bias: only lncRNAs that bind to proteins selected for immunoprecipitation will be assayed, and new lncRNA binding proteins will not be identified. As new eCLIP-seq (or other RBP-lncRNA interaction) datasets become available, these can be easily included in PLAIDOH analyses.We designed PLAIDOH to be accessible and customizable for experimental labs with limited computational resources and time. PLAIDOH\u2019s software and dependencies are limited to the installation package (available at GitHub [97]) and R [98], which is free, available in graphical user interface form (R Studio), and supported by many online forums and help websites [99]. Because users will have diverse questions to ask of their datasets, we designed PLAIDOH to be customizable as to the data sources and types incorporated, parameters included for ranking, and lncRNA features or mechanisms of action that are prioritized. Users have the option to add their own data, or publicly available data, or a combination, and compare experimental groups. Users may choose to include or exclude nearly any of PLAIDOH\u2019s parameters for mechanistic prediction, since there are few required inputs for PLAIDOH to run successfully. In addition, users can customize the parameters that are included, or not, in the ranking, depending on their experimental design, scientific question, and/or desired downstream study.The feature that most distinguishes PLAIDOH from other lncRNA analysis tools/methods is that it addresses the most challenging step in \u2018omics studies: selecting a small number of \u201ctop hits\u201d for focused mechanistic studies. This step is particularly challenging in the study of lncRNAs since there is so little known about their function and essentially no established ontologies. In other lncRNA prediction methods, ranking is either unavailable or based on only one aspect of lncRNA activity (e.g., expression, genomic location) [22\u201324, 100]. In contrast, PLAIDOH incorporates several measures of lncRNA activity, transcriptional control, and protein interaction to output integrated scores and rankable metrics. This integrated approach is essential for distinguishing among potential mechanisms of action for a given lncRNA, rather than merely ranking on individual data types, and is attainable only when quantitative data is integrated into a scoring system.Our goal in developing PLAIDOH was to accelerate the laborious process of prioritizing and selecting lymphoma-associated lncRNAs for downstream experimental studies. Here we validated PLAIDOH\u2019s functional predictions for RP11-960\u2009L18.1, confirming that it is not a cis-regulatory lncRNA for PLCG2, but rather likely acts in the cytoplasm by interacting with one or more RBPs (NF90, KHDRBS1, PUM2) to promote the growth of lymphoma cells.In summary, PLAIDOH provides a flexible, accessible method for the prediction and ranking of functional connections between individual lncRNA, coding gene, and protein pairs. PLAIDOH fills an important void with a facile method to facilitate the study of lncRNAs in a variety of systems, from normal development to cancer. Our method enables prioritization and ranking based on any parameter, function, or interaction of interest to the user, to expedite the transition to focused experimental studies of lncRNAs. We expect that PLAIDOH will accelerate validation and follow-on mechanistic studies to better characterize lncRNAs, which will ultimately provide new insights into the role of these enigmatic molecules in normal and pathogenic cellular processes.CHR must be the chromosome for the transcript on that line. The start and stop coordinates may be any region of the transcripts the user wishes to study (ie. TSS to end of transcript), but PLAIDOH will only consider within the boundaries provided by the input file. The NAME category may be either a gene name or an ENSEMBL identifier. The TYPE category may be any identifier the user chooses but PLAIDOH will ONLY provide annotation and predictions for transcripts labeled \u201cprotein_coding, \u201clncRNA\u201d or antisense_rna\u201d all other designations will be filtered into the \u201cmisc\u201d output file. The user may include as many samples as they choose and utilize any calculation for expression (e.g., FPKM, CPM, microarray probe count etc.). The input should be sorted by CHR and START coordinate using sort -k1,1 -k2,2n.A detailed overview of the PLAIDOH output file can be found in Additional file 2: Table S1 and instructions for running PLAIDOH.pl can be found at: www.github.com/sarahpyfrom/PLAIDOH.For illustrating trends specific to either positively- or negatively-correlated pairs of lncRNAs and proteins we devised plots by the correlation of the lncRNA and protein coding gene, positive Spearman correlation coefficients (rho) values are plotted above the central line and negative Spearman correlation coefficients (rho) values are plotted below. This approach was used in Fig. 3 and Additional file 4: Figure S3.Using the PLAIDOH output table generated from TCGA-AML data, the total number of coding genes and the number of coding genes significantly correlated (Adjusted p\u00a0<\u20090.01) within +/\u2212\u2009400\u2009kb of each lncRNA was calculated. A frequency matrix was plotted with total protein numbers on the x axis and the significantly correlated protein numbers on the y axis. The frequency of each combination of total protein number/number significantly correlated proteins was calculated and plotted on the matrix from all lncRNAs in the dataset. Additionally, a Z-score of all correlations for each lncRNA was calculated and plotted, such that coding genes, which are greater than one standard deviation more or less correlated with a given lncRNA, would be colored purple or green in the resulting graph.For pan-cancer analysis, RNA-seq expression data from TCGA datasets (LUAD, BRCA, CESC, DLBC, AML) were run through PLAIDOH, which automatically calculates correlation values for each LCP. Significantly correlated LCPs conserved across one or more TCGA datasets were identified. Significance was defined as an adjusted spearman p-value <\u20090.05.The LncRNA Transcript Cis-regulatory score is calculated as follows:The Enhancer score is calculated as follows:All underlined components of the above calculations are described in more detail in Additional file 2: Table S1. The cutoffs for PLAIDOH-calculated Enhancer and LncRNA Transcript Cis-regulatory scores were calculated by plotting ranked scores for each lncRNA/coding gene pair and finding the geometric inflection point, defined as the point at which the linear regression line crossed the ranked scores line. Linear regression lines were calculated using the geom_smooth command from the R ggplot2 package: geom_smooth(method\u2009=\u2009\u201clm\u201d, se\u2009=\u2009FALSE, formula\u2009=\u2009y~x). Both scores were ranked for graphing output using the following formula: rank (SCORE, na.last\u2009=\u2009FALSE, ties.method\u2009=\u2009\u201crandom\u201d). All scores were scaled to 100 for graphing in figures.PLAIDOH output was used to create a binding matrix for each RBP to each lncRNA. An RBP was considered to bind a lncRNA if both the K562 and HepG2 eCLIP assays showed binding of the RBP to the lncRNA (score of 1000) OR if both replicates of either cell line showed binding. If an RBP does not show evidence of binding a lncRNA, the overlapping region is given a score of 0 on the matrix.Sub-cellular localization of lncRNAs was determined using GM12878 RNA-seq from ENCODE. Nuclear and Cytoplasmic protein-coding and non-coding FPKMs were downloaded from hg38-aligned RNA-seq. Chromosomal coordinates were then lifted over to hg19 using UCSC\u2019s liftover tool. The total number of reads for each transcript was calculated as the sum of fragments per kb per million reads from each sub-cellular dataset and the percent of the total FPKM was calculated for both the Nuclear and Cytoplasmic datasets. For later analysis, is determined to be \u201cNuclear\u201d if 70% of the normalized fragments are in the nuclear RNA-seq compartment, \u201cCytoplasmic\u201d if 70% of the reads are in the cytoplasmic compartment and \u201cNuclear and cytoplasmic\u201d if between 30 and 70% of the reads are in the nucleus. RBP sub-cellular localization is determined by Immunofluorescence as described in Sundararaman et al., 2016 [82]. For each possible lncRNA/RBP combination a \u201cLocalization concordance score\u201d was calculated. If there is no evidence that the lncRNA and RBP interact based on the ENCODE eCLIP data, the pair is given a score of 0. If an RBP binds a given lncRNA and the sub-cellular localization of both the lncRNA and corresponding RBP are both determined to be Nuclear or both are Cytoplasmic, the pair is given a score of 2 or\u2009\u2212\u20092, respectively. If the lncRNA is primarily Nuclear and the RBP does not have a Nuclear localization by Immunofluorescence (or vice versa), the overlapping region is given a score of 1 or\u2009\u2212\u20091. If both the RBP and lncRNA are considered to be present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (as described above) the pair is given a score of 3.CRISPR/Cas9 Upstream Target Sequence: GTACGAAACCTCCCCGCGGCRISPR/Cas9 Downstream Target Sequence: AGGTAGGAGGAACGCGCTCshRNA #1: 5\u2019 ACAGGTCATTCTTCTGCTCTAAtagtgaagccacagatgtaTTAGAGCAGAAGAATGACCTGG 3\u2019shRNA #4: 5\u2019 CCACAGGGAAGAATGACTTCAAtagtgaagccacagatgtaTTGAAGTCATTCTTCCCTGTGA 3\u2032Whole cells were lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented with Roche protease inhibitors, an equal volume of loading dye was added and lysates were boiled for 10\u2009min. The equivalent of 0.13, 0.067 and 0.03 million cells were loaded for cells infected with a control shRNA and each RP11-960\u2009L18.1-targeted shRNAs. After transfer to nitrocellulose paper, blots were incubated in primary antibodies for PLCG2 (Santa Cruz sc-407) and GAPDH (abcam ab9485) at a concentration of 1:1000 overnight at 4C. Donkey Anti-rabbit secondary antibody from GE Healthcare UK Limited (NA9340V) was used at a concentration of 1:10,000 and imaged using Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate (32106).Sub-cellular fractionation of cytoplasm, nuclear total, nucleoplasm and chromatin for RNA isolation was performed as described in in [101]. cDNA was made from whole cells and cell fractions using the High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit from ThermoFisher (4387406). qRT-PCR was performed using primers specific for PLCG2, RP11-960\u2009L18.1, JPX and GAPDH and the SYBR Green Real-Time PCR Master Mix. Sub-cellular Fraction delta Ct values were calculated relative to the Ct values of the cytoplasmic fraction and whole cell post-shRNA delta-Cts were calculated relative to GAPDH levels.PLCG2 For: TCAATCCGTCCATGCCTCAGPLCG2 Rev.: CCTCGACGTAGTTGGATGGGRP11-960\u2009L18.1 For: GTCACACAGCCAACTTGCGRP11-960\u2009L18.1 Rev.: AGCCTCTATCTGCTTACGTGCJPX For: GACACTGGTGCTTTCCTGGGJPX Rev.: TTGTACCACCGTCATCAGGCGAPDH For: ACCCACTCCTCCACCTTTGACGAPDH Rev.: TGTTGCTGTAGCCAAATTCGTTAs described in Koues et al., 2015 [21], briefly: RNA-seq libraries were prepared from rRNA-depleted samples (Ribo-Zero, Epicentre) using TruSeq RNA Sample kits with indexed adaptors (Illumina), pooled (3 libraries), and subjected to 100\u2009bp paired-end sequencing using an Illumina HiSeq2000. RNA-Seq data were aligned to the transcriptome and reference genome (build GRCh37/hg19) with TopHat [102]. RNA-seq data from were processed using Cufflinks, a transcript assembling software package, with settings designed to identify both novel and annotated transcripts. Annotated transcripts were compiled from several sources (ENCODE, ENSEMBLE, see below). A master GTF was created to summarize and merge all transcripts detected across samples. This master GTF was then used to analyze all samples to quantitate expression level of each transcript. In this way, transcript isoform, detection (+/\u2212), and normalized expression level (FPKM) was determined for each sample for all transcripts, to compare expression patterns across sample types. We used CPAT to exclude transcripts with coding potential [103].TCGA data [26] was downloaded from https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/. Five datasets were used: LUAD (Lung Adenocarcinoma), BRCA (Breast Invasive Carcinoma), CESC (Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Endocervical Adenocarcinoma), AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia) and DLBC (Lymphoid Neoplasm Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma). Gene Expression Quantification (RNA-seq) aligned to hg38 was acquired from all tumor types and chromosomal positions were converted to hg19 using the UCSC liftOver tool (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver). For PLAIDOH analyses, all 48 samples from the DLBC data were compiled into a single input file, and 48 samples were randomly selected from each of the other four cancer sets (LUAD, BRCA, CESC and AML) to create cancer-specific input files with identical transcript annotations.Expression of lncRNAs and coding genes from multiple cell lines (K562, U87, HeLa, HEK293T, MCF7, MDA-MB-231 and iPSCs) were graciously provided upon request from [28].All default input data files were curated from publicly available resources and modified to fit specific file formats as outlined in the PLAIDOH documentation (will be submitted along with the script on github).

However, the mechanisms underlying these changes have not been fully characterized. To address this knowledge gap, we sought to identify long non-coding RNAs that may be involved in lymphoma pathogenesis. We built an RNA-seq analysis pipeline designed to discover novel (not previously annotated) long non-coding RNAs, and to quantify expression of all known and novel RNA transcripts in our primary NHL and normal B cell samples (Fig.\u00a01a-b).\n\nFig. 1\nHundreds of lncRNAs are dysregulated in NHL compared to normal B cells. a Schematic depicts collection, flow cytometry purification, and \u2018omics profiling of malignant and normal B lymphocytes from NHL patients and healthy volunteers [21]. b Diagram of NHL lncRNA discovery pipeline. RNA-seq data was analyzed using a de novo processing pipeline to enable identification of novel transcripts (Cufflinks). Novel RNA transcripts were merged with annotated transcripts (Cuffmerge). c Volcano plot highlights lncRNA transcripts with significantly different expression in NHL tumor samples compared to normal B cells (red).

LncRNAs have been categorized in many ways: including by function, localization, size, and site of transcription [2, 39]. Functionally, a simple separation can be made between lncRNAs that impact gene transcription, those that act post-transcriptionally to alter protein expression, and those that act in other cellular pathways (Fig. 2a). Our goal was to develop a method robust enough for smaller datasets such as those generated by a single lab, rather than a large consortium (e.g., TCGA). Thus, we focused our pipeline and algorithms on experimental data, rather than on motifs or binding predictions. We first focused on modulation of gene expression (cis-regulatory), because these are generally thought to be the largest group of lncRNAs [2, 39], and because publicly available RNA-seq datasets provide gene regulatory input and output data (i.e., expression) upon which to train a predictive method. We reasoned that a predictive tool could be further improved by the inclusion of transcriptional control mechanisms, such as data from epigenetic profiles, enhancer and super-enhancer landscapes, and genome architecture. For trans-regulatory lncRNAs, we incorporated RNA-binding protein interactome and subcellular localization data. We incorporated these normalized and statistical data with regression analyses to generate predictive scores for each potential function and protein or gene partner (Fig. 2b, Additional file 2: Table S1). These statistically ranked output scores can be tailored for prioritization of top hits based on user preference. Thus, PLAIDOH is a simple, user-friendly informatic pipeline and set of algorithms that integrates genome, transcriptome, and interactome datasets and calculates three predictive scores based on several different measures of transcriptional regulatory control, protein interaction, and cellular pathway.\n\nFig. 2\nAn overview of the PLAIDOH pipeline and algorithm output. a Schematic of the single, input file required by PLAIDOH to identify all possible lncRNA/Coding gene Pairs (LCPs) in the user\u2019s dataset. b Overview of the datasets that are used by PLAIDOH to annotate lncRNAs and predict activity based on genomic and epigenomic context. c Abridged example of the primary PLAIDOH output table, showing the three scores PLAIDOH calculates for each LCP as well as the 30+ additional columns of valuable information about the lncRNA and coding gene in each LCP. d Examples of graphs output by PLAIDOH as part of its standard run settings. The three LCPs and lncRNA1 diagrammed in a are highlighted in red and green, respectively\nWe posited that an initial measure of a lncRNA\u2019s effect on a coding gene\u2019s expression is correlation of expression between the two transcripts, which may be positive or negative. We sought to calculate the most statistically robust associations given that most experimental -omics datasets, including our NHL/normal B cell data, are relatively small and/or heterogeneous (e.g., derived from outbred humans). Therefore, we focused on local coding genes, defined as those within 400\u2009kb flanking a lncRNA. We chose this total distance (800\u2009kb) because it is the size of an average topologically associated domain (TAD) [40]. Each lncRNA had a median of six coding genes within 400\u2009kb flanks (range: 0\u201368), though these numbers varied by reference annotation used for each dataset and the number of lncRNAs defined therein. There was no significant association of lncRNA expression level with distance to coding genes (Fig.\u00a03a, Additional file 3: Figure S2A). Moreover, separating lncRNAs into groups defined by location relative to coding genes (overlapping, anti-sense, or distal) revealed that overlapping and antisense lncRNAs did not have higher expression than distal lncRNAs (Additional file 3: Figure S2B).\n\nFig. 3\nPLAIDOH reveals global patterns of LCP co-expression. LncRNA expression (log10 FPKM) (a & c) or LCP correlation (\u2212log10 Spearman adjusted p-value) (b & d), are plotted relative to genomic distance from each lncRNA to a coding gene (a & b) or the nearest enhancer (c & d) within 400\u2009kb regions flanking the lncRNA. LCPs with positive Spearman correlation coefficients (rho) are plotted in the upper half of each plot; those with negative Spearman correlation coefficients (rho) are plotted in the lower half. Black points highlight LCPs with adjusted Spearman p-values <\u20090.05 or FPKM >\u20091\nIn evaluating the potential of lncRNAs for transcriptional regulatory control, we observed that some lncRNAs demonstrated distinct patterns of correlative expression relative to the coding genes within their local genomic environment. We sought to differentiate lncRNAs that correlate with all, some, or only one gene within 400\u2009kb up- or down-stream, since these patterns may indicate different transcriptional control mechanisms: generalized contribution to transcriptional activity in a locus versus regulation of a specific gene. To segregate these distinct patterns, we devised two new data visualizations and applied them to data from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) from TCGA [26]. First, we created a 3-dimensional frequency matrix surface plot to show the frequency of LCPs for a specific number of significantly correlated coding genes versus the total coding genes within 400\u2009kb flanking the lncRNA. This contour plot effectively segregates lncRNAs that are significantly correlated with large numbers and high proportions of neighboring coding genes (Fig.\u00a04a). We highlight two such lncRNA pairs that are correlated with large clusters of coding genes (Fig. 4b). The expression of AC004076.2 is significantly and positively correlated with a large cluster of zinc finger KRAB repressor domain-containing proteins. This correlation is in contrast to the other lncRNA genes in this locus, suggesting a specific transcriptional control relationship between this lncRNA and this cluster of zinc-finger transcriptional repressors. The second example is lncRNA U91328, whose expression is significantly and negatively correlated with a cluster of Histone H1 genes. Histone H1 linker histone proteins interact with DNA between nucleosomes and are involved in chromatin condensation, nucleosome remodeling, regulation of transcription, and DNA replication. Histone H1 genes are mutated in some hematopoietic cancers; they exhibit altered and heterogeneous expression within tumors; and silencing of these genes is associated with maintenance of self-renewal capacity in tumor cells [54\u201357]. These two lncRNAs exemplify the ability of PLAIDOH analysis and the 3-D frequency matrix plot to visually highlight lncRNAs that correlate with and may contribute to the transcriptional control of a large number and/or large proportion of coding genes.\n\nFig. 4\nPLAIDOH ranks lncRNAs by number and fraction of correlated coding genes. a Contour plot shows the frequency of significant LCPs numbers as a function of the number of all possible coding gene pairs for each lncRNA. Color indicates increasing log10 frequency of LCPs at each x,y data point (white-blue-green).

We next sought to evaluate whether similar regulatory patterns were observed for lncRNAs across diverse human cell types and from large sample sets. In terms of number of primary human samples, the largest and most diverse -omics study to date is The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) [26, 27]. We compared five different cancer types from TCGA, including epithelial and hematopoietic lineage (acute myeloid leukemia, AML; breast cancer, BRCA; cervical cancer, CESC; diffuse large B cell lymphoma, DLBC; and lung adenocarcinoma, LUAD). The Venn diagram and heatmap in Fig.\u00a05a-b show that these cancers have common and distinct sets of significant positively or negatively correlated lncRNA-coding gene pairs. The majority of these (56%) are significant in only one cancer type (cancer-specific) and less than 2 % (1.8%) are significant in all five cancer types (cancer-recurrent). Negatively correlated, significant LCPs comprise a much smaller subset that is almost exclusively cancer-type specific (Additional file 6: Figure S5A-B). These results likely reflect the known cell-type specificity of lncRNA expression patterns, and may indicate that the observed specificity is due to the role of lncRNAs in transcriptional regulation.\n\nFig. 5\nLncRNAs demonstrate common or cancer-type specific correlation profiles. a Venn diagram shows the number of significant LCPs shared or unique among five TCGA cancer types.

Ranking the LCPs from least to greatest for each score revealed an inflection point in the distribution of scores. We geometrically defined the inflection point as the cut-off for high predictive scores (see Methods). Ranked plots from ENCODE and TCGA datasets show several lncRNAs and their known coding gene cis-regulatory targets among the highest lncRNA transcript and enhancer cis-regulatory scores (Fig.\u00a06 and Additional file 7: Figure S6, red points), including HOTAIR and HOTAIRM1 and HOX genes [29\u201334], XIST/FTX/JPX and CHIC1 [73\u201376], lincRNA-p21(PANDAR) and CDKN1A(p21, 77]. Also ranked highly by PLAIDOH\u2019s enhancer cis-regulatory score are LINC00263 and its paired coding gene SCD (Fig. 6b). LINC00263 was a validated hit in a CRISPRi cell growth screen in ENCODE cell lines using dCas9-KRAB to epigenetically repress lncRNAs [28]. Similarly, PVT1 has a very highly ranked enhancer cis-regulatory score, was also a CRISPRi hit in ENCODE breast cancer cell lines [28], and demonstrated to inhibit MYC expression in cis via promoter competition for common enhancer elements [35]. Many of these LCPs were also ranked highly by enhancer cis-regulatory score in multiple TCGA cancer types (Fig. 6e and Additional file 7: Figure S6). The role of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of Non-Hodgkin B cell Lymphoma (NHL) has not been extensively evaluated. In samples from TCGA DLBCL, which are a type of NHL, we identified several lymphoma oncogenes within LCPs with high enhancer or transcript cis-regulatory scores, including anti-apoptotic factors BCL2L2 (BCL-W) and BCL2L1 (BCL-XL), BCL6, and BCL7A, suggesting that the paired lncRNAs may play a role in the transcription of these lymphoma-associated genes (Fig. 6d-f, green points). These and other top-scoring LCPs in cancer cell lines and other TCGA cancer types have not been previously reported, and may represent novel lncRNA cis-regulatory relationships (Fig. 6 and Additional file 7: Figure S6, green points).\n\nFig. 6\nPLAIDOH ranks LCPs by likely transcriptional regulatory mechanism, inferred from Enhancer and LncRNA Cis-regulatory Scores. a-f Plots show LCPs from ENCODE cell lines (a-c) or TCGA DLBC samples (d-f). a & d Plots show LCPs ranked by increasing LncRNA Transcript Cis-regulatory Scores.

Highlighted in red are known enhancer-associated lncRNAs; in green are novel LCPs with the highest scores and/or containing known lymphoma oncogenes. c & f XY plots show Enhancer versus LncRNA Transcript Cis-regulatory Scores segregating LCPs. Dotted lines in a-f reflect score cut-offs based on the geometric inflection points calculated from the data in a, b, d & e. Red and green data points are from a & b (for c), or d & e (for f)\nHaving defined scores to predict lncRNA cis-regulatory transcriptional mechanisms, we next turned to incorporating data measuring of other potential lncRNA functions. A major category of function not yet addressed by PLAIDOH is modulation of protein or pathway activity via direct binding of proteins or protein complexes [2, 39, 82]. To identify and rank these potential interactions, PLAIDOH integrates data from RNA-binding protein (RBP) immunoprecipitation sequencing studies (eCLIP-seq) in which the relative strength and significance of the RBP-lncRNA interaction is given a score based on normalized read depth and specificity controls [82]; for this analysis PLAIDOH required a maximum interaction score (see Methods). For corollary confirmatory biological data, PLAIDOH compares subcellular localization of the potentially interacting lncRNA and RBP, as determined by subcellular fraction RNA-seq, Western blot, and immunofluorescence [1, 82], and outputs a coefficient of co-localization. Figure\u00a07a shows this interactome localization analysis as an interaction matrix of lncRNAs and RBPs, in which interaction and co-localization are color-coded, segregated, and sorted. Each row represents a lncRNA and each column an RBP. Grey blocks indicate an eCLIP interaction but the lncRNA and RBP pair are not co-localized; red, blue, or purple indicate co-localization of the pair in the cytoplasm, nucleus, or in both fractions, respectively. By sheer number and by percentage of significant binding interactions, the greatest fractions are comprised of lncRNA-RBP pairs with cytoplasmic and/or nuclear co-localization. By comparing the number of colored blocks for each, one can appreciate the number of significantly interacting RBPs per lncRNA (and vice versa). Most of the RBPs interact with multiple lncRNAs, which is not surprising given that the target proteins were selected based on known RNA-binding function. Many of the lncRNAs also interact with multiple RBPs, but PLAIDOH\u2019s analysis and the interaction matrix shown in Fig.\u00a07a enable filtering or selection of lncRNA-RBP pairs based on cellular co-localization and specificity of interaction.\n\nFig. 7\nPLAIDOH ranks lncRNAs using biological and experimental data from RNA binding protein interaction. a Interaction matrix of lncRNAs and RNA Binding Proteins. Binding events of concordantly localized lncRNAs and RBPs are colored by subcellular localization to the nucleus (blue), cytoplasm (red) or both nucleus and cytoplasm (purple).

Labeled dots highlight previously published and validated binding of RBP/lncRNA pairs\nWe developed PLAIDOH to prioritize and help us to select a small number of human NHL-associated lncRNAs to move forward for focused experimental studies. One of these is highly and recurrently expressed in lymphoma compared to normal B cells: RP11-960\u2009L18.1 (Fig.\u00a08a). It is located upstream of the gene that codes for PLCG2, a phospholipase C family enzyme specific for B lymphocytes that is activated by B cell receptor (BCR)-associated kinases upon antigen-mediated BCR stimulation. By converting PIP2 to IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG), PLCG2 increases intracellular Ca2+ levels and activates B cell signaling pathways, including NF-kB, NFAT, and Ras, and their downstream gene targets [86]. Located within an NHL super-enhancer, RP11-960\u2009L18.1 has a high enhancer cis-regulatory score with PLCG2 (42.1, quadrant two); while its score with another neighboring gene, CMIP, was below the cutoff (18.0, quadrant one). The lncRNA transcript cis-regulatory scores for both genes are also below the cutoff (2.9 for PLCG2, 1.5 for CMIP)) (Fig. 8a-b). These results suggest that transcriptional regulation of PLCG2 may be through enhancer-mediated mechanisms rather than via direct activity of the RP11-960\u2009L18.1 transcript itself. To test the role of the lncRNA transcript itself, we used shRNA knock-down and CRISPR knock-out of RP11-960\u2009L18.1 in lymphoma B cell lines that highly express RP11-960\u2009L18.1 (HBL1, U2932). Using two different shRNAs or CRISPR-Cas9 mediated deletion of the first two exons of RP11-960\u2009L18.1, we successfully decreased expression of RP11-960\u2009L18.1 by 70\u201395%. However, neither mRNA nor protein levels of PLCG2 were affected (Fig. 8c-d, Additional file 10: Figure S9A-B). These results suggest that the RP11-960\u2009L18.1 transcript itself does not substantially modulate the expression of PLCG2 in B cells, however the overlapping enhancer region that was left largely intact may have a cis-regulatory role in control of PLCG2 transcription.\n\nFig. 8\nValidation of PLAIDOH\u2019s functional predictions for a lncRNA highly expressed in human NHL. a UCSC Genome browser view of HK4me3 ChIP-seq (NHL) and RNA-seq (NHL, normal B cells) for the RP11-960\u2009L18.1 locus. b XY plot shows Enhancer versus LncRNA Transcript Cis-regulatory Scores in primary NHL samples, highlighted are RP11-960\u2009L18.1 and the two most proximal coding genes. c Expression of PLCG2 and RP11-960\u2009L18.1 measured by qRT-PCR in HBL1 lymphoma B cell line treated with scramble or one of two RP11-960\u2009L18.1 shRNAs. d Western Blot for PLCG2 or GAPDH in HBL1 cells treated with scramble or one of two RP11-960\u2009L18.1 shRNAs.

(PDF 2055 kb)", "s12864-019-5558-8": "Little is understood of the molecular mechanisms involved in the earliest cell fate decision in human development, leading to the establishment of the trophectoderm (TE) and inner cell mass (ICM) stem cell population. Notably, there is a lack of understanding of how transcriptional networks arise during reorganisation of the embryonic genome post-fertilisation.We identified a hierarchical structure of preimplantation gene network modules around the time of embryonic genome activation (EGA). Using network models along with eukaryotic initiation factor (EIF) and epigenetic-associated gene expression we defined two sets of blastomeres that exhibited diverging tendencies towards ICM or TE. Analysis of the developmental networks demonstrated stage specific EIF expression and revealed that histone modifications may be an important epigenetic regulatory mechanism in preimplantation human embryos. Comparison to published RNAseq data confirmed that during EGA the individual 8-cell blastomeres are transcriptionally primed for the first lineage decision in development towards ICM or TE.Using multiple systems biology approaches to compare developmental stages in the early human embryo with single cell transcript data from blastomeres, we have shown that blastomeres considered to be totipotent are not transcriptionally equivalent. Furthermore we have linked the developmental interactome to individual blastomeres and to later cell lineage. This has clinical implications for understanding the impact of fertility treatments and developmental programming of long term health.The preimplantation period is a unique window in development, when extensive remodelling of the genome and epigenome occur over the few days that the embryo is a free-living entity. This window is of critical importance allowing the fertilised oocyte to (i) correctly reprogram the male genome and activate the new embryonic genome, (ii) substantially reset the epigenome via a process that includes generalised demethylation and remethylation, and (iii) establish the first cell fate decision in development towards formation of the trophectoderm (TE), while maintaining the inner cell mass (ICM) stem cell population [1\u20133].The processes underlying some of the key molecular and cellular decisions are not fully understood, including Embryonic Genome Activation (EGA), mechanisms underlying epigenome remodelling, and cell fate decisions governing blastomere development and differentiation into the ICM or trophectoderm (TE) tissues of the blastocyst. Early embryos inherit stored mRNA and proteins from the oocyte which guide development under maternal control until EGA. The degradation of particular inherited mRNAs may itself regulate the timing of EGA [4]. The start of EGA in the human was originally defined as occurring between the 4-cell and 8-cell stage [5]. However more recent studies have suggested that there are in fact three waves of EGA, occurring at the 2 cell, 4-cell and 8\u201310 cell stages, with the final representing the highest level of transcriptional activity [6]. Epigenetic remodelling in the human embryo occurs post fertilisation, with embryonic DNA generally demethylated to 30\u201340% by the 2-cell stage, with minimal subsequent loss of methylation, and no re-methylation until the post-implantation stages [7]. During this period of intensive remodelling, cell fate decisions are initiated which lead to segregation of human ICM and TE. It is currently unknown as to whether individual blastomeres from 8-cell embryos are pre-determined to become ICM or TE, but it is known that considerable heterogeneity exists between blastomeres at this point, due in part to the absence of gap junctional communication prior to this stage [8, 9]. The reported variation in different transcript subsets between individual human 8-cell blastomeres has been interpreted as indicating that some may arrest whilst others develop [10]. In particular, individual 8-cell blastomeres were reported to display significant variation in down-regulation of maternally-expressed genes, which may indicate early lineage specification. In contrast, other studies have shown that blastomeres from 5- to 8-cell human embryos are not pre-determined to become either ICM or TE [11]. We hypothesised that an analysis of the global human embryo transcriptome using a combination of network analyses, dimensional scaling and change point analysis would allow us to identify the transcriptional co-ordination involved in the key early developmental event of blastomere cell fate specification.Upon donation to research, embryos were cultured in G1 medium (Vitrolife, Goteborg, Sweden) covered with a thin layer of mineral oil (Ovoil, Origio, Malov, Denmark) until day 3, followed by G2 medium (Vitrolife) from day 3 to blastocyst at 37\u2009\u00b0C, 6% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Oocytes and embryos at a range of developmental stages, including four oocytes, four 4-cell embryos, three 8-cell embryos, 32 individual blastomeres obtained from four eight cell embryos (blastomeres) and four blastocysts were lysed and reverse transcribed as previously described [8, 13] and cDNA was prepared by polyA-PCR amplification [14]. Embryos were only used if they both reached the appropriate development stage for time in culture and were morphologically normal. Of the 32 8-cell blastomeres, 8 disaggregated from a single 8-cell stage embryo were used to generate single cell transcriptomic data, the remaining 24 disaggregated from 3 complete sets of 8 individual blastomeres were used for qPCR validation. 8-cell stage embryos used for blastomere isolation were equivalent in stage and appearance to those used for single embryo analysis and, to further reduce bias, we analysed only blastomere sets in which we recovered all 8 blastomeres from an 8-cell embryo. For blastomere disaggregation, whole embryos were exposed to Acid Tyrode\u2019s Solution (Sigma) for ~\u20093\u2009s intervals until zona breakdown occurred and individual blastomeres were isolated via mechanical disaggregation. The polyA-PCR technique amplifies all polyadenylated RNA in a given sample, preserving the relative abundance in the original sample [15, 16]. A second round of amplification using EpiAmp (Epistem, Manchester, UK) and biotin-16-dUTP labelling using EpiLabel (Epistem) was performed at the Paterson Cancer Research Institute Microarray facility, as previously described [12]. For each sample, our minimum inclusion criterion was the expression of \u03b2-actin evaluated by gene specific PCR. Labelled PolyA-cDNA was hybridised to the GeneChip\u00ae Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, SantaClara, CA, USA) and data initially visualised using MIAMIVICE software [12]. The statistical and graphical R computing language was used together with Bioconductor packages [17, 18], to assess quality control of microarray data (Array Quality Metrics package) [19] (Additional file 1: Supplementary Methods and Additional file 2: Figure S1) and normalisation undertaken using the Mas5 algorithm [20]. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted using Partek Genomics Suite software (St. Louis, MO, USA), with IsoMap cross-validation undertaken using Qlucore Omics Explorer 2.3 (Qlucore, Lund, Sweden).Differential gene expression was determined using ANOVA (Fig. 1b). Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) corrected p-values \u22640.05 were considered differentially expressed [21]. Genes were defined as expressed at a particular developmental stage if present in at least 75% (or two of three) samples (Additional file 3: Table S1). Normalised eukaryotic initiation factor (EIF) family member expression levels were extracted from the arrays for relative expression across development.Gene specific PCR amplification of a panel of pluripotency, polarity and hippo-signalling genes was assessed by qPCR using Power SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Primers were designed to produce a product between 50 and 200 base pairs within the first 500 base pairs of the gene to prevent amplification bias. Each 10\u2009\u03bcl reaction contained 2\u2009ng polyA-cDNA template and the cycling was performed in an ABI 7300 real-time PCR system. A 10\u2009min denaturation step at 95\u2009\u00b0C was followed by 39 PCR cycles comprising 30s denaturation at 95\u2009\u00b0C, 30s annealing at 60\u2009\u00b0C and 35\u2009s extension at 72\u2009\u00b0C. An extended annealing step of 10\u2009min at 72\u2009\u00b0C finalised the run. Identification of a single peak at melt curve analysis signified gene expression. Reactions were performed in triplicate for each individual sample. \u0394Ct was calculated as 40-Ct value for data presentation purposes. Some samples showed low levels of gene expression however genes were not classed as \u2018expressed\u2019 above background level unless detected with 37 or fewer cycles of real-time PCR. We only included a sample in the analysis data set if greater than 3 target genes were defined as expressed. Associations between expressed genes were analysed for significance using a chi squared test. Genes displaying p\u00a0\u2264\u20090.05 were defined as differentially regulated.We generated human protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks based on differentially expressed genes in Cytoscape [22] by inference of protein: protein interactions using the BioGrid database [23] with the BioGrid Plugin for Cytoscape [24]. This network generation approach uses a process of inference where a minimum number of connecting proteins are added between proteins with differential gene expression to form a fully connected PPI network model. As a result we capture a section of the human interactome that is associated with transcriptomic differences. Networks enriched for differentially expressed genes were constructed for each developmental stage. The Cytoscape plugin Moduland [25] was used to identify overlapping modules of protein:protein interactions within each developmental network and modular hierarchy was determined using the centrality score (a quantitative measurement of proximity to the centre of the network \u2013 the more central a protein is the more it can influence the effect of all other proteins in the network).Epigenetic regulator genes were compiled from the Qiagen Epigenetic Chromatin Remodelling Factors PCR array (Qiagen) and the Epigenetic Modification Enzymes PCR array (Qiagen), supplemented with genes identified by the network analysis with a known epigenetic role. A hypergeometric distribution was applied to assess enrichment of individual 8-cell blastomeres for chromatin modification enzymes/remodelling factors. Causal Networks (Z-scores >\u04062\u0406) were used to assess regulatory elements within the networks [26] (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis [IPA], Qiagen).Frozen robust multi-array analysis (fRMA) [27] was used to define absolute expression by comparison to publically available microarray datasets within R and an expression barcode was defined for each specific tissue and cell type [28, 29]. This GeneBarcode was used to generate single sample networks for the individual blastomeres. Using GeneBarcode, we considered transcripts expressed in 2\u20135 blastomeres, resulting in 5044 genes for downstream analysis.Our embryonic development transcriptomic data (Oocyte, 4-cell, 8-cell and Blastocyst) were filtered by using PCA analysis (Qlucore Omics Explorer 2.3), and 1676 probes were selected with a 1.2 cut-off for the projection score [30]. Then change point analysis was performed in order to identify times in embryonic development when there was a distinct shift in the distribution of gene expression, using the \u201cchangepoint\u201d package [31] within R [17]. The transcript expression levels across the stages between two change points were replaced by the average value within this interval and the transcripts were then clustered using hierarchical clustering.We analysed previously published single-cell RNAseq data from 81 individual 8-cell human blastomeres [32]. Transcripts per million (TPM) expression values were visualised in Qlucore Omics Explorer 2.3 and outliers were removed. These were normalised for inter-individual variation (mean centred by the embryo donor couple) and by application of a projection score [30] of 0.21 to remove noise (n\u00a0=\u200959). Gene sets identified were analysed for Gene Ontology and Canonical pathway enrichment using DAVID [33] and mapped onto our differentially regulated 8-cell blastomere network modules.Over the developmental series of embryonic stages we identified 7 key transitions in differentially expressed gene probe-sets using change point analysis (Fig. 2b). Genes expressed in the oocyte and 4-cell embryo but not subsequently (Changepoint group 7; CP7) were considered to be maternally expressed only, those expressed in the oocyte and subsequently at 8-cell (CP6), or oocyte/4-cell and subsequently at blastocyst (CP1), were considered to be expressed both maternally and embryonically following EGA, while those not expressed in the oocyte but only at subsequent stages were assumed to reflect EGA at early (CP3), mid (CP4 and CP5) and late (CP2) developmental stages. The gene ontology associated with each change point group was determined (Additional file 3: Table S2).Gene networks of the transition for each embryonic stage were constructed by inference to the human interactome network (BioGRID version 3.2.110) (Additional file 2: Figure S2A and B) and a hierarchy of gene modules were defined using the topological property of centrality (Additional file 2: Figures S2C and D). Overlapping network modules were identified and centrally connected genes were used to assess the crosstalk between modules (Additional file 2: Figure S2E and F). We tracked centrally connected genes across our human embryo samples, highlighting features which are maintained throughout development or unique to a certain embryonic stage (Fig. 2c).Modules expressed in embryos post-EGA, or conserved in both the 8-cell and blastocyst, were deemed to reflect transcription following early and/or later EGA in preparation for implantation and continuing development (Fig. 2a). Definition of network modules in the 8-cell embryo and blastocyst (Additional file 2: Figure S2A-D) were used as a basis to identify upstream regulatory elements (Additional file 2: Figure S2E and F). This approach revealed relationships between TRIM28/KAP1, MDM2, HDAC2 and TP53 and the networks of genes they regulate to be of central importance during 8-cell to blastocyst development (Additional file 1: Supplementary results, Additional file 3: Table S3, Additional file 2: Figure S3). Network models defined using inference to the human interactome were confirmed and the robustness of the identified gene modules were assessed by comparison to co-expression networks (Additional file 2: Figure S4).To assess if the differences between the blastomeres represented transcriptional priming towards either ICM or TE lineage, we repeated the same analysis with the inclusion of TE (n\u00a0=\u20095) and ICM (n\u2009=\u20095) samples (from Stevens et al 2018 [34]) (Fig. 3d). Based on the degree of module overlap (shared \u22655 genes), 5 blastomeres are similar to the ICM, B1, B5 and B6 showed statistically significant overlap (p-value range 8.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2212\u200922 to 2.4\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2212\u200982). To verify our circos plots, we visualised the blastomere, TE and ICM global expression profiles using IsoMap dimensional scaling (Fig. 3e). These analyses revealed similarities in global gene expression between blastomere B3, B4, B7, B1, B6 and B5 with ICM, and blastomere B8 and B2 with TE, providing independent validation of the overlaps shown in the network derived circos plot and indicating that the TE expression profile was similar to B2, B5 and B8. B2 was therefore identified as TE-like in all three independent analyses, suggesting that blastomere cell fate may be primed at this stage.In order to explore blastomere cell fate and potential mechanisms in more detail we carried out single embryo and blastomere polyA-PCR and qPCR on a further 24 individual blastomeres disaggregated from 3 complete sets of 8 individual blastomeres. We screened for the expression of genes associated with the Hippo signalling pathway which is involved in specifying TE cell fate [35] (LATS2, YAP, TEAD4, TAZ, CDX2), cell polarity [36] (PARD3, PARD6A, EZRIN, PRICKLE2 and CDX2) and cell pluripotency [37] (SOX2 and OCT4) (Additional file 2: Figure S6). No embryo was devoid of LATS2, with expression detected within at least 2 of the 8-cell blastomeres. The blastomeres lacking LATS2 but expressing TAZ/YAP, TEAD4 and CDX2 may have greater potential to give rise to future TE. EZRIN was the only polarity gene expressed in the majority of 8-cell blastomeres; however levels of expression varied greatly between individual cells. We observed no clustering of gene expression by embryo and the differences in expression of genes involved in hippo signalling, polarity and pluripotency pathways between the individual blastomeres verified the finding from whole transcriptome data that 8-cell blastomeres were not transcriptionally equivalent.The role of EGA in blastomere identity was assessed by examining that transcriptome of individual 8-cell blastomeres to reveal if they displayed varying levels of EIFs. Half of the EIFs differentially regulated in the 8-cell embryo and blastocyst, were present in all individual 8-cell blastomeres, including the 8-cell-specific EIF4A3. However the remaining EIFs displayed varying expression levels, with B1 expressing all (10/10) of these EIFs and B2 (3/10) and B8 (5/10) expressing the least number of EIF family members (Fig. 4c).As epigenetic modifier genes such as TRIM28 were differentially expressed during preimplantation development (Additional file 2: Figure S3A), we constructed networks of chromatin modifying enzymes/remodelling factors (Additional file 3: Table S4). More Epigenetic regulatory genes were expressed in the 8-cell embryo (102 genes) compared to the blastocyst (40 genes). Only two genes, HDAC2 and YY1, were upregulated at both stages compared to the 4-cell embryo. Both of these genes were identified as key 8-cell and blastocyst network members (Additional file 2: Figure S2E and F). HDAC2 is a downstream target of the blastocyst TRIM28 network (Additional file 2: Figure S3A), whilst YY1 is a centrally connected gene (Additional file 2: Figure S2C and D) in the 8-cell and blastocyst embryo. Overall, the larger subset of histone acetyltransferases, methyltransferases and deacetylases identified in the 8-cell embryo, indicated that these genes play a part in epigenetic remodelling at this stage.In humans the major wave of EGA occurs between the 4-cell and 8-cell stage [5, 6], although the mechanisms by which this activation is translated into downstream regulation of embryonic development are unclear. We identified 7 distinct patterns of expression in the human embryonic transcriptome corresponding to different early or late patterns around the time of EGA. Eukaryotic initiation factors (EIFs) are closely associated with transcription activation in mammalian development [40]. We report here a pattern of EIF expression which closely follows EGA, and may be responsible for translating its impact. EIF expression peaked in the 8-cell embryo, which agrees with data of Vasenna et al, who identified three waves of transcriptional activation in humans; the last wave occurring at the 6 to 8-cell stage being responsible for the transcription of the largest number of genes [6]. EIF2S2, EIF3I, and EIF4M are up-regulated in the 8-cell embryo, with only EIF2S2 having been previously detected in hESCs and mESCs [41]. EIF expression and activity seems likely to be one of the main mechanisms driving expression of the embryonic developmental programme post-EGA.Using multiple methods of analysis provides a high confidence framework for understanding the relationship between gene networks at different stages of human preimplantation development. This revealed that TRIM28/KAP1, MDM2, HDAC2 and TP53 and the networks of genes they regulate are of central importance at the 8-cell to blastocyst transition. TRIM28 recruits chromatin modification enzymes and remodelling factors to form a repressive chromatin complex and its expression is essential in mice [42]. We report that TRIM28 controls a central network of 46 genes, regulating MYC, TP53 and MDM2, suggesting this is\u00a0essential in embryonic development across species, including humans.Our analysis showed that genes involved in epigenetic regulation were enriched during late EGA. This expression coincides with the highly transient period of genomic and epigenomic reorganisation [43\u201346]. We observed the greatest epigenetic signature enrichment in the 8-cell embryo, with more histone deacetylases, methyltransferase and demethylases expressed than DNA methyltransferases and demethylases. DNA modifications are thought to be the main form of epigenetic regulation applied later in development when cells differentiate into particular cell types and genes exhibit long term repression, whereas histone modifications are the major form of gene silencing in early differentiation [45]. The removal of histone modifications is enzymatically easy and so may be preferable during dynamic periods of genome reorganisation, whereas removal of such groups from DNA carry the risk of deleterious DNA mutations. Our analysis of transcriptomic data suggest that in the preimplantation human embryo histone modifications may be the main epigenetic regulatory mechanism during the transient and dynamic period of genome reorganisation. Although, of course, protein synthesis and activity of epigenetic regulators may not necessarily follow transcript expression and further epigenomic analysis would be required to confirm this observation. However, modifications to the epigenome are closely correlated with the transcriptome in developing systems [47]. Epigenetic regulatory networks and chromatin modifying genes in particular were expressed at the 8-cell stage, and in light of their potential role in gene silencing, we explored their association with blastomere identity. Epigenetic gene expression patterns revealed two groups of 8-cell blastomeres (Fig. 7).To understand the molecular mechanisms by which individual 8-cell blastomeres achieve diverging cellular identities and either retain pluripotency or differentiate towards TE, we assessed the transcriptome of individual 8-cell stage blastomeres using gene network analyses. It has been previously shown that blastomeres have different transcriptional [48\u201350] and epigenomic identities [51]. In this manuscript we have defined the relationship with respect to both the global transcriptome and to gene families involved in specifying cell fate. Analysis of genes involved in the hippo signalling pathway, cell polarity and pluripotency showed that no individual blastomere exhibited an identical expression profile to any other blastomere within the same embryo or to those of other 8-cell embryos. The generation of single sample networks for the individual blastomeres global transcriptomes allowed us to quantify the differences/similarities in modules between blastomeres and to map these with high confidence to the embryonic developmental interactomes identified earlier. Groups of blastomeres were identified as more or less similar to each other, and to global transcriptomes of ICM and/or TE which may represent transcriptional priming towards one or other lineage (Fig. 7).We examined if the developmental changes identified around the time of EGA mapped onto the blastomere transcriptome, i.e. is blastomere transcriptional identity driven by EGA? The EIF family genes involved in translating EGA expression, revealed a close relationship with blastomere identity. Half of the post-EGA differentially expressed EIFs displayed disparate expression, with blastomere B1 expressing all EIFs and blastomere B2 and B8 expressing the least EIFs, suggesting that loss of EIFs may be a potential first point of differentiation [9, 12].We accounted for more variation in the data by the application of dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA and IsoMap), which demonstrated a direct relationship between the global transcriptomic profiles of six blastomeres with ICM, of which all but B3 show differentially regulated network module similarities to ICM (Fig. 7). IsoMap also identified a direct relationship in the global genetic profiles of blastomeres B8 and B2 with TE, and blastomere B2 showed differentially regulated network module similarities to TE.The network approaches used in this work are resistant to random error due to the scale free nature of the interactome [52] and therefore form a good basis for the comparison of blastomeres where inter individual variation has been recognised. A similar separation of the blastomeres is apparent after comparison to the most detailed publicly available RNAseq dataset from Petropoulos et al [32]. Overall, the blastomeres enriched in the Petropoulos RNAseq group 3 genes have a stronger divergence towards ICM, whereas the blastomeres enriched in RNAseq group 1 genes have no particular lineage bias (Fig. 7). Having established the likely transcriptional bias of blastomeres towards ICM or TE, we further suggest that the pluripotent state leading to ICM is associated with maintenance of EIF expression, and epigenetic status.We have applied a combination of systems biology approaches to identify a high confidence framework of human preimplantation embryonic networks focussed on EGA and its relationship to blastomere cell fate. This will be uniquely valuable for understanding early human development, where classical experimental design cannot be easily applied due to the rare and protected nature of human embryos. Moreover our gene regulatory framework highlights points of susceptibility during human embryo development, particularly around gene networks involved in EGA and blastomere fate. This provides the scientific community with the opportunity to explore the mechanisms underlying early programming of development, long term health e.g. according to the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD), and a baseline of normal development against which ART practitioners can assess the impact of new clinical technologies [53, 54].Utilising multiple layers of computational evidence, we have detected two sets of blastomeres within an 8-cell embryo which exhibit diverging tendencies towards ICM and TE (Fig. 7). Overall our results suggest that the majority of blastomeres are still pluripotent and are unlikely to be lineage-specified or committed. This observation agrees with previous studies indicating that 5\u20138 cell blastomeres showed equal expression in all ICM, stem-ness and TE markers [11], and with RNAseq data, revealing relatively little transcriptional divergence at the 8-cell stage [32]. However we have identified significantly more heterogeneity between blastomeres than has been previously reported and through the application of our network module approach we have detected biologically significant biases with functional relevance which may prime cells for the earliest cell fate determination. Our approach allows a greater depth of predicted functional analysis than other previously used single dimensional approaches.Embryonic Genome ActivationEukaryotic Initiation FactorsFalse Discovery RateInner Cell MassPrincipal component analysisTrophectodermTranscripts per millionThe work presented here was conducted as part of two EU projects: FP7-HEALTH-2011-TWO-STAGE-278418, EPIHEALTH and FP7-PEOPLE-2012-ITN, PITN-GA-2012-317146, EPIHEALTHNET.

We carried out single embryo and blastomere polyA-PCR global transcriptome profiling on replicate oocytes and embryos at the 4-cell (n\u00a0=\u20094), 8-cell (n\u00a0=\u20093) and blastocyst (n\u00a0=\u20094) stage, together with 8 individual blastomeres disaggregated from one 8-cell embryo, and trophectoderm (n\u00a0=\u20094) and inner cell mass (n\u00a0=\u20094) disaggregated from blastocysts. We carried out single embryo and blastomere polyA PCR and qPCR on 24 individual blastomeres disaggregated from 3 complete sets. 8 individual blastomeres were used for qPCR validation. b) Different transcriptomic comparisons applied throughout the paper. To determine differences in gene expression between samples ANOVA was performed on 4-cell embryos vs. oocytes, 8-cell embryos and blastocysts. Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) corrected p-values \u22640.05 were considered differentially expressed. Frozen robust multi-array analysis (fRMA) was used to define absolute expression by comparison to publically available microarray datasets within R and an expression barcode was defined for the 8-cell blastomere, ICM and TE sample\nWe carried out single embryo and blastomere polyA-PCR, global transcriptome profiling on replicate oocytes (n\u00a0=\u20094) and embryos at the 4-cell (n\u2009=\u20094), 8-cell (n\u00a0=\u20093) and blastocyst (n\u2009=\u20094) stage, together with 8 individual blastomeres disagregated from one 8-cell embryo (Figs. 1, 2a). PCA analysis revealed that the intact 8-cell embryos and the individual 8-cell blastomeres demonstrated overlapping transcriptomes (Fig. 2a), indicating that the embryo disaggregation procedure for isolating blastomeres had not significantly altered the blastomeres\u2019 expression profiles.\n\nFig. 2\nEmbryonic transcriptomic profiles. a) Principle Component Analysis (PCA) of Mas5 normalised expression values across the human embryonic developmental stages, four oocytes (orange), four 4-cell embryos (red), three whole 8-cell embryos (green), eight 8-cell blastomeres (blue) and four blastocysts (purple).

The top 15 modules are extracted from each developmental stage networks and listed in hierarchical order from (1st) most central in the network to (15th) less centrally connected in the network. The gene labelled on the module represents the most centrally connected gene within the module. Blue lines indicate modules which have >\u20092 shared members between the different developmental stages and the thicker the line the greater the number of shared genes. Modules outlined in red have no shared central elements with the following or preceding developmental stage\nWe defined the transcriptional signatures underlying maintenance of pluripotency and cell lineage separation in the human embryo by comparing the transcriptomes of individual 8-cell blastomeres (B1-B8, Fig. 3). From these data we constructed interaction networks for each blastomere to reveal a hierarchy of modules of highly connected genes (Fig. 3a). We identified upstream regulatory patterns for each blastomere and overlaid the upstream regulatory genes onto blastomere network modules (Additional file 2: Figure S5); the high level of overlap (p-value range 0.01\u20131.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2212\u200923) provided confidence in our gene identifications. Module similarity between the blastomeres was visualised via connectivity in circos plots based on the degree of module overlap (shared \u22655 genes) (Fig. 3b). B4 and B8 were less similar to other blastomeres, whilst B1 shared the greatest amount of similarity to other blastomeres, in particular B3, B5 and B7 (Fig. 3c).\n\nFig. 3\nComparison of individual 8-cell blastomere, inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) network modules. a) Schematic of methodology.

Whole transcriptome gene expression of the EIF family was significantly upregulated in the 8-cell and blastocyst (Fig. 4a) and this expression pattern closely followed the general wave of transcripts initiated during EGA [39]. Altogether, 45 EIFs were expressed during pre-implantation development (Fig. 4a). Nineteen EIFs were differentially regulated between the 8-cell embryo and blastocyst; EIF2S2, EIF3I, and EIF43M are up-regulated at the 8-cell, EIF4E, EIF4E2 and EIF4G2 are up-regulated in the blastocyst (with EIF4E, EIFE2 and EIFG3 regulated by the TRIM28 network, Additional file 2: Figure S3A), and EIF4A3 was upregulated in the 8-cell embryo compared to both the 4-cell and blastocyst stage embryo (all FDR modified p-value \u22640.05) (Fig. 4b).\n\nFig. 4\nEukaryotic Initiation Factor (EIF) expression across embryo development and the individual 8-cell blastomeres a) Heat Map to represent the 45 EIFs expressed constitutively within at least one oocyte or embryonic stage. Mas5 flags with 75% expression within a specific developmental stage are classed as expressed. b) Schematic indicating differentially expressed EIFs (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR\u2009\u2264\u20090.05) between the 4-cell embryo, 8-cell embryo and blastocyst. c) Frozen robust multi-array analysis (fRMA) was used to define absolute expression by comparison to publically available microarray datasets within R and an expression barcode was defined for each 8-cell blastomere. The heat map represent EIFs expression within individual 8-cell blastomere expression barcode data, genes with a score of \u20181\u2019 are present and \u20180\u2019 are absent. Half of the EIFs associated with EGA are expressed in all 8 blastomeres, the other half are variably expressed, with blastomere B1 expressing the full complement (10/10), while B2 expressed the fewest (3), with B8 expressing 5/10\nDue to the upregulated epigenetic-associated gene expression at the 8-cell stage, we assessed the expression of epigenetic regulatory genes within the individual 8-cell blastomeres (Fig. 5). Individual 8-cell blastomeres were significantly enriched (P\u00a0<\u20093.4\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2212\u200920) for chromatin modification enzymes and remodelling factors. TRIM28 network genes, HDAC2 and ZSCAN4 were expressed in all blastomeres. However global epigenetic gene expression patterns revealed two groups of individual 8-cell blastomeres; B3/B4/B6, and B1/B2/B5/B7/B8.\n\nFig. 5\nChromatin modification enzymes/remodelling factors gene expression barcode data within individual 8-cell blastomeres.

The global epigenetic gene expression pattern reveals two groups of individual 8-cell blastomeres; B3/B4/B6 and B1/B2/B5/B7/B8\nTo validate and extend our findings of blastomere transcriptional heterogeneity, we analysed single-cell RNAseq data from 81 individual 8-cell human blastomeres [32]. After outlier removal, 59/81 published blastomere datasets of high quality (embryos in which \u22654 of the 8 blastomeres were recovered) were used in further analysis. A PCA of the remaining blastomeres highlighted that the greatest variation in gene expression existed between the individual embryos rather than the individual blastomeres (Fig. 6a). Once samples were normalised for inter-embryo variation we were able to detect differences between individual blastomeres regardless of their embryo origin (Fig. 6b). We identified the presence of 4 sets of genes; of which group 3 was enriched (p\u00a0=\u20090.0012) for Pluripotency of Embryonic Stem Cells (Additional file 1: Supplementary Results, Additional file 2: Figure S7 and Additional file 3: Table S5).\n\nFig. 6\nIndividual 8 cell blastomere RNA-Seq data (from Petropoulos et al).

Our analysis extends understanding in this area significantly by identifying gene networks involved in EGA and blastomere transcriptional identity and cell fate (Fig. 7).\n\nFig. 7\nSummary schematic representing 8-cell blastomere genomic divergence. Using a combination of systems biology techniques including network analysis, nearest neighbour PCA (isoMap), EIF expression and epigenetic-associated gene expression we have detected two sets of blastomeres within an 8-cell embryo which exhibit diverging tendencies towards ICM and TE. Nearest neighbour PCA analysis (isoMap) reveals similarities in global gene expression between blastomere 3, 4, 7, 1, 6 and 5 with Inner Cell Mass (Blue brackets/arrows), and blastomere 8 and 2 with Trophectoderm (burgundy brackets/arrows). Green arrows represent similarity in network modules, as highlighted by circos plots. Black bracketed Blastomere 3, 7 and 8 are enriched in RNAseq cluster 3 and Blastomere 6, 5 and 8 are enriched in RNAseq cluster 1. Red brackets/arrows represent blastomeres with the greatest maintenance and loss of developmental EIF expression.

TRIM28 together with MYC and TP53, may represent the upstream transcriptional control network over the MDM2 module in the blastocyst and provide upstream regulation of epigenetic networks. B) MDM2 is identified as a key module and upstream regulator at the blastocyst stage. MDM2 together with 22 participating regulators, controls the expression of 93 differentially regulated genes within the blastocyst.

Hybridization-based target enrichment is one potential method for increasing the sensitivity of viral detection via high-throughput sequencing.This study expands upon two previously developed panels of virus enrichment probes (for filoviruses and for respiratory viruses) to include other viruses of biodefense and/or biosurveillance concern to the U.S. Department of Defense and various international public health agencies. The newly expanded and combined panel is tested using carefully constructed synthetic metagenomic samples that contain clinically relevant amounts of viral genetic material. Target enrichment results in a dramatic increase in sensitivity for virus detection as compared to shotgun sequencing, yielding full, deeply covered viral genomes from materials with Ct values suggesting that amplicon sequencing would be likely to fail. Increased pooling to improve cost- and time-effectiveness does not negatively affect the ability to obtain full-length viral genomes, even in the case of co-infections, although as expected, it does decrease depth of coverage.Hybridization-based target enrichment is an effective solution to obtain full-length viral genomes for samples from which virus detection would fail via unbiased, shotgun sequencing or even via amplicon sequencing. As the development and testing of probe sets for viral target enrichment expands and continues, the application of this technique, in conjunction with deeper pooling strategies, could make high-throughput sequencing more economical for routine use in biosurveillance, biodefense and outbreak investigations.High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS), also known as Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), has many advantages for pathogen detection as compared to traditional methods such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), serological assays, and/or culture-based methods. Metagenomic sequencing is the high-throughput sequencing of nucleic acid from complex samples rather than from purified microorganisms. Metagenomic sequencing is much less biased than other methods and allows for the detection of fastidious or nonculturable organisms as well as multiple unrelated pathogens within a single sample [1]. Moreover, detection via HTS is much less susceptible to false-negative results caused by antigenic drift or signature erosion. Despite these advantages, one of the technical challenges encountered with respect to metagenomic sequencing is obtaining adequate depth and breadth of coverage from pathogens like RNA viruses that i) typically have small genomes, and ii) are typically present at low titers amidst the background \u2018noise\u2019 of the host and commensals [1]. Genome size directly affects sensitivity of detection by HTS because the sampling of sequence fragments within a sample depends on the prevalence of those fragments and organisms with larger genomes typically contribute more fragments, therefore being sampled more often than organisms with smaller genomes. In other words, organisms with larger genomes have the potential to contribute a larger proportion to the overall number of sequencing reads even when the plaque-forming units (PFU), or colony-forming units (CFU) in the case of bacteria, are equivalent to that of an organism with a smaller sized genome.Although conventional shotgun sequencing allows for the detection of all domains of life, it rarely returns robust coverage of a small viral genome when taken from a very complex sample. A variety of possible strategies exist to enhance the sensitivity of HTS for virus detection and characterization, including purification of specific viral fractions by physical methods such as filtration and ultracentrifugation [2], amplicon-based target enrichment, and hybridization-based target enrichment. Purification of viral fractions is ideal in some cases, although it can be laborious, and for certain sized samples (for instance clinical samples of very limited volume) it may not be realistic. The use of hybridization-based target enrichment could be preferable to the aforementioned technologies because it has the potential to yield sequence data covering the entire genome of multiple viruses with just one sequencing reaction by using genome-wide probes designed against multiple viruses to specifically select for viral cDNA prior to sequencing. Amplicon sequencing of viral genomes is a technique that has been widely used, but it has some disadvantages, which were articulated by Metsky et al. in a recent study of Zika virus (ZIKV) [3]. First, traditional amplicon sequencing typically requires technically challenging normalization and pooling of individual amplicons to cover the entire genome of one specific virus. However, recently a protocol was published for efficient amplicon primer design and multiplex amplicon generation in a single tube for sequencing in the MinION or Illumina platforms [4]. Although this method obviates the amplicon normalization and pooling steps and is effective for producing whole genome sequence data from a low titer ZIKV sample, this method has not been demonstrated for production of whole genome sequence data for multiple diverse viruses from a single complex sample. Additionally, amplicon sequencing typically requires as much as 40\u2009cycles of PCR amplification [4\u20136], which can introduce sequence errors. Furthermore, amplicon-based sequencing is vulnerable to false negative results caused by mutations in primer binding sites, as was recently demonstrated for Dengue virus (DENV) [5] as well as false positive variant results possibly caused by low and/or uneven coverage [7]. By contrast, the use of probes tiled along the entire length of a viral genome to hybridize and select for virus-specific fragments has the potential to produce less false-negative pathogen detection results by virtue of many more potential binding sites along an individual genome and resulting more uniform coverage.Ebola virus (EBOV) is one specific example of a pathogen for which false-negative PCR results can have devastating consequences and for which available PCR-based assay effectiveness has been shown to be affected by drift [8]. Therefore, a panel of 80-mer oligonucleotide probes designed against eight Filovirus genomes was recently used for post-sequencing library enrichment in a HTS-based study of a recent EBOV outbreak in West Africa and in an investigation of potential genetic variation of EBOV in experimentally infected nonhuman primates [9\u201311]. In this protocol, viral enrichment is coupled with the RNA Access kit, developed by Illumina, Inc. The technical advancements of the RNA Access kit had already enabled the sequencing of previously unsequencable materials such as those of low concentration and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue [12], and now this protocol has been employed not only for the detection and characterization of EBOV from clinical samples but also for detection and characterization of respiratory viruses in clinical samples [13, 14]. In general, hybridization-based viral target enrichment has been successfully employed to characterize viruses found within both contrived samples and clinical samples [3, 9, 10, 13, 15\u201320]. The performance of the Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) version of this method [14], which uses probes for 34 common respiratory viruses in conjunction with the TruSeq RNA Access protocol, was recently investigated and it was demonstrated to work well overall when tested on human clinical samples [13]. Specifically, the authors reported successful enrichment for 30 of 33 human clinical samples tested. Importantly, RT-PCR was conducted on those same samples and Ct values of respiratory viruses in those clinical samples ranged from 21 to 33 [13], which provides a framework for beginning to assess the limits of detection of hybridization-based enrichment sequencing. Herein, we extend this approach by i) expanding this viral probe panel to include viruses of biosurveillance and biodefense concern and ii) employing carefully constructed mock clinical samples to systematically assess this technique\u2019s performance in a variety of conditions, such as deeper multiplexing for cost effectiveness as well as more extensive co-infection scenarios. We demonstrate the sensitivity and reproducibility of hybridization-based viral enrichment sequencing despite virus divergence and we show that this sensitivity is maintained even with extensive multiplexing of samples to decrease cost. Herein we demonstrate that within one reaction tube, this technique can even be used to detect and discriminate between multiple serotypes of a virus within a clinical sample or to detect and discriminate amongst multiple unrelated viruses that present similar clinical symptoms, and we demonstrate this performance at clinically relevant concentrations of virus.Given the dramatic increase in sensitivity observed when complex samples were spiked with an individual virus\u2019s genetic material and subjected to target enrichment, we next sought to evaluate whether these effects would still be observed in the presence of an additional virus and at lower concentrations of IFV gRNA overall. Therefore, IFV gRNA was spiked into total RNA derived from Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cell culture lysate at an overall lower range of increasing concentrations than IFV was spiked in the prior experiment. As before, the samples were aliquoted into two parts that were processed by each method. In these synthetic co-infection samples, target enrichment sequencing resulted in a simultaneous increase in sensitivity for both viruses as compared to unbiased, shotgun sequencing (Fig. 1b). As expected, a constant high proportion of reads mapping to MERS-CoV was observed and the proportion of reads mapping to IFV increased in a dose-dependent fashion with the number of genome equivalents spiked (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Table S2).Although each targeted virus was represented by enough sequencing reads to be easily detected, there were differences in the depth and breadth of genome coverage observed. Whereas the full CHIKV genome was recovered from all spiked samples at a very high depth of coverage (Fig. 2c), in the case of DENV-2, an average of 92.2% of the genome was recovered from co-infected samples (Fig. 2d) and the average ZIKV linear genome coverage was lower, at 68.8% (Fig. 2b). These patterns in coverage were similar for both replicates (Additional\u00a0file\u00a03: Figure S1). Overall, the proportion of reads mapping to a given virus was consistent and reproducible regardless of whether a sample was probed singly or probed within a group of four or 12.It should be noted that in this experiment, both purified RNA as well as total nucleic acid samples containing HAdV-4 and HAdV-51 genetic material were processed and sequenced (Fig. 3g and h). The total nucleic acid samples were processed without a DNase step to allow for potential detection of both the DNA viral genome as well as viral transcripts. In the case of both HAdV-4 (species E) and HAdV-51 (species D, not targeted specifically by probes), the vast majority of the resulting sequencing reads were virus-specific and the reads were well-distributed along the length of the genome in coding regions, and in the case of the total nucleic acid samples, noncoding regions as well (Fig. 3h), a phenomenon that was consistent between replicates (replicate coverage data is shown in Additional\u00a0file\u00a04: Figure S2).A major challenge faced in virus detection as well as virus sequencing is the difficulty to detect divergent strains of viruses typically present at low titers amongst a robust host or environmental background. Small viral genomes present at low concentrations are effectively drowned out by signal from host nucleic acid and from commensal microorganisms. A variety of methods have been employed to increase the viral signal in high-throughput sequence data, including amplicon sequencing, but for viruses like DENV, with its genome of less than 11\u2009kb in size, even amplicon sequencing is regarded as an inefficient approach for samples with Ct values of 29 or higher [5]. Such limitations have been of particular concern for U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) laboratories tasked with biosurveillance and biodefense activities in regions with limited material resources and human expertise. Part of the motivation for this effort was to provide DoD laboratories operating in austere environments new tools aimed at enhancing on-site sequencing capacity when engaged in Force Health Protection (FHP) activities.We demonstrate here that hybridization-based viral target enrichment yields robust coverage of small genomes from clinical samples, even yielding full-length, deeply covered genomes at concentrations whereby current amplicon sequencing protocols may be expected to fail. Moreover, we demonstrate that hybridization-based target enrichment can allow for not only detection, but also genetic characterization such as strain-level discrimination, even at very low concentrations of virus. The capability to detect and discriminate between multiple serotypes of a virus within a complex sample at clinically relevant concentrations by using this enrichment method increases the utility of high throughput sequencing for biosurveillance and for infectious disease diagnostics. For both biosurveillance and clinical sequencing, assay cost and time are important considerations. We have demonstrated that more extensive pooling and multiplexing can be performed to reduce cost and time without sacrificing the assay\u2019s ability to detect at least two strains of related virus and a variety of unrelated viruses in one sequencing reaction.To date, the published viral target enrichment studies vary in focus and include characterization of EBOV during a recent outbreak in West Africa [9, 10] and detection of multiple viral families within clinical samples [13, 16]. While the probes employed in the studies published to date vary in length from 50- to 120-mers, enrichment methods also can differ by the number of probes and target viruses included in a set. An additional potential protocol difference is the number of samples pooled, which ranges from a single sample to 12 [9, 10, 15]. The current recommendation by Illumina for viral enrichment is to pool four samples [14].The experiments described here systematically test enrichment of a single library as well as pools of four or 12 libraries and include a variety of titers of as many as three viruses within a single sample and as many as 12 samples within an enriched pool. For all conditions, even with more extensive pooling and multiplexing, we observed a dose-dependent response to varying Ct values even in co-infected clinical samples. A dose dependent response was also observed by O\u2019Flaherty et al. in two co-infected samples containing Respiratory Syncytial virus and human Coronavirus OC43 spiked-in each at Ct 28 or 32 [13]. Interestingly, although there was the expected dose-dependent effect on the proportion of sequencing reads derived from IFV as the concentration of spiked IFV gRNA increased, there was a slight decrease in the proportion of MERS-CoV-derived sequencing reads in samples at the upper end of the IFV gRNA concentration range. This was not expected given that MERS-CoV was present in each replicate at a constant, high level. We hypothesize that this may be due to saturation of the streptavidin beads used to capture probe-cDNA hybridized fragments. Further experimentation will be required to test that hypothesis.Efficacy of probes varies by homology to the viral target, as evidenced by our results and those in the literature [13, 15]. For example, the reference sequence used to design the probe set for DENV-1 exhibits\u00a074% nucleotide identity over 35% of the length of the closest sequenced reference for the DENV-2 strain that was spiked. It is possible that this overlap, which is not shared by the DENV-2 probes and DENV-1 spike-in, contributed to an overrepresentation of DENV-1 reads in the experiments presented in Figs.\u00a03 and 4. Additionally, by comparison to the other richly covered strains of virus tested in multiplexed samples, there was an underwhelming coverage for both strains of ZIKV. It is possible that the quality of RNA from these viruses was less than the other RNA spike-ins, or that the probe panel for ZIKV is less efficacious when used in combination with the entirety of the probe set. The probes for ZIKV were synthesized and added later after all the other probes were combined (in response to the recent outbreak) and therefore it is possible that the comparatively lower performance of the ZIKV probes is due to a difference in quantitation of the ZIKV probe set.We observed that HAdV-51 (species D) genetic material was efficiently enriched even though the only adenoviruses used to design the probe panel were species B, C, and E. This experiment indicates that the protocol works as well for this particular DNA virus as it does for RNA viruses. Limits of detection may vary by viral target, which may explain why previously published experiments showed differences between DNA and RNA viruses [13]. Nucleotide identity between human adenovirus species D (the species to which HAdV-51 belongs) and the other human adenovirus species HAdV-A, B, C, and E was reported by Kaneko et al. to range from 58.73 to 69.35% [26]. In our study, the probe panel containing probes for species HAdV-B, C, and E effectively enriched for the entirety of the HAdV-D genome. This suggests that when using long (80-mer) probes designed against several species of virus, related non-targeted species may also be enriched without being specifically included in the panel, if the nucleotide identity among them is at least 60\u201370%, and if multiple related species are targeted by the probes in the panel (in this case three species). This cross-reactivity for related human pathogens could prove to be a useful feature, by allowing for enrichment of more relevant viruses without added cost spent to increase the number of probes.Our findings demonstrate that breadth of coverage does not suffer from extensive pooling but that deeper depth of coverage is gained by limiting the number of samples pooled. Extensive pooling makes hybridization-based enrichment sequencing more economical. Viral target enrichment could be applied as an economical approach to sequencing viruses known to mutate quickly and therefore evade other assays, fastidious organisms, or complex samples of limited volume. For example, this method could be prescribed to a scenario in which multiple serotypes of a virus such as DENV are expected to be present in a sample but detection is prohibited via conventional methods such as amplicon sequencing due to low titers. Viral target enrichment designed for a broad panel of targets could also be useful to the infectious disease field by enabling detection of low-titer viruses present in clinical samples taken from patients suffering from symptoms of unknown etiology. Another applicable use of a broad probe panel could be to perform environmental sampling. The aforementioned applications often involve complex samples of limited volume, for which this method is ideal. An important caveat to this approach is that while viral target enrichment is an economical method by which to reduce background noise in a metagenomic sample, probe design requires prior knowledge of the closest-sequenced genome for each viral target. Amplicon sequencing may be the best approach for previously known samples and unbiased whole shotgun sequencing may be more appropriate for a virus-rich sample. None of these approaches obviates the use of amplification by polymerase chain reaction or the potential introduction of sequence errors, and so standard quality analyses by computational methods should always be employed. As the development and testing of probe sets for viral target enrichment expands and continues, the application of this technique could make HTS more economical for routine use in Force Health Protection activities including biosurveillance, biodefense and outbreak investigations.IFV (H1N1) particles (A/Swine/Iowa/15/30; ATCC, Manassas, VA), MERS-CoV RNA (Jordan-N3/2012; NAMRU-3), HAdV nucleic acid extract from particles (RI-67 and Bom; ATCC, Manassas, VA), ZIKV RNA extract from particles (MR766 and R116265; ATCC, Manassas, VA), CHIKV RNA (gift from LTC Richard Jarman, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research), DENV-1 RNA extract from particles (TH-SMAN; ATCC, Manassas, VA) and DENV-2 RNA extract from particles (New Guinea C; ATCC, Manassas, VA) were spiked into relevant matrices to construct contrived metagenomic samples for testing.To prepare guano samples five-gram quantities of commercial Jamaican bat guano (Planet Natural; Bozeman, MT) were placed in 50\u2009mL of sterile-filtered Hank\u2019s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS), vortexed to mix, centrifuged at 3,100 x g for 10\u2009min, and filtered sequentially through 0.45\u2009\u03bcm and 0.22\u2009\u03bcm filters prior to spiking with IFV particles. Post-addition of IFV, samples were centrifuged at 39,000 x g for three hours at 10\u2009\u00b0C to concentrate spiked and native virus particles, supernatant was removed, and total RNA was extracted from the pellet using the QIAampViral RNA Isolation Kit (QIAGEN; Valencia, CA). After elution in 30\u2009\u03bcL buffer AVE, a second elution using 20\u2009\u03bcL of the eluate was performed.To prepare cell culture matrix samples, a nucleic acid spiking approach was used. In this case, decreasing amounts of IFV RNA were spiked into a constant mass of total RNA that had been extracted from Vero cells infected with MERS-CoV. Aliquots of the same Vero cell culture were used for each sample. Genome equivalents of IFV spiked into samples were calculated based on RNA mass extracted from virus particles and genome size.For serum samples, RNA was extracted from Human Serum (BioIVT, Westbury, NY) and mixed with viral RNA.Total nucleic acid was extracted from adenovirus particles using the QIAGEN QiAMP MinElute Virus Spin Kit, omitting carrier RNA. The samples were eluted in 24\u2009\u03bcl buffer AVE. Viral RNA was extracted from virus particles and human serum using the QIAampViral RNA Isolation Kit as described above. The Qubit double stranded DNA Broad-Range Assay Kit and the Qubit RNA Broad-Range Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA) were used to assay extracts.For virus enriched sequencing, TruSeq RNA Access libraries were created as per manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Illumina; San Diego, CA), with the following two modifications: i) rather than the standard CEX oligonucleotides that are designed for enrichment of human genes, a custom pool of oligonucleotides was used that includes probes along the entire genome length of 83 viruses (Table 1) as well as probes specific for several human house-keeping genes, and ii) in the second PCR amplification, 17\u2009cycles were used rather than ten. Samples were probed singly or in pools of four or 12 and multiplexed for sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform using v3 chemistry, 2X75 bp read lengths.For conventional HTS (shotgun) sequencing, TruSeq libraries were pooled and sequenced on the MiSeq platform using v3 chemistry, 2X300 bp read lengths. For the guano samples, these consisted of an aliquot of each of the TruSeq RNA Access libraries from the step prior to virus enrichment. For the MERS-CoV-Vero cell matrix samples, these consisted of shotgun libraries made with the TruSeq RiboZero Gold Library Preparation Kit (Illumina; San Diego, CA).A composite panel of 80-mer DNA probes was assembled using a previously described panel for respiratory viruses [13, 14, 20], a previously described panel for Filoviruses [9\u201311], plus an additional panel of newly designed probes for 41 viruses of biosurveillance and biodefense concern, for a total of 19,077 probes. The methods employed for capture oligo design were essentially as described in O\u2019Flaherty at al [13], although the design varied somewhat across the target viral genomes. For instance, in the case of the previously described respiratory virus panel, the design was focused on coding regions [13]. In general, genomes were tiled with capture oligos in a way so as to avoid low-complexity sequences and repetitive sequences. Probe spacing and overlap vary per virus due to attempts to design probes that cover multiple related virus strains resulting in overlapping tiled design around more variable regions, whereas regions more conserved among multiple strains resulted in probes more or less tiled end-to-end. All probes were biotinylated on the 5\u2032 end. Sequences of viral capture probes are provided in Additional\u00a0file\u00a05.Quality control, de novo assembly, taxonomic classification, and reference-based analyses were conducted using EDGE Bioinformatic software v 2.0 [27] with default parameters and host removal of human reference GRCh38 and\u00a0also with CLC Genomics Workbench v11 (QIAGEN Bioinformatics; Redwood City, CA). The reference mapping parameters in CLC were modified from defalt settings to 0.8 length fraction and 0.8 similarity fraction with global alignment and random mapping of non-specific matches. BLAST [28] was also used to further investigate specific datasets. The ggplot2 R package was used to generate depth of coverage plots [29].base-pairCoding exomeColony-forming unitsChikungunya virusCycle thresholdDengue virusDeoxyribonucleic acidDouble-strandedEbola virusFormalin-fixed paraffin-embeddedGenome equivalentsGenomic RNAHemagglutininHuman AdenovirusHigh-Throughput SequencingInfluenza viruskilobaseMiddle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome CoronavirusNext-Generation SequencingPolymerase Chain ReactionPlaque-forming unitsRibonucleic AcidReal-time PCRReverse transcription quantitative PCRRespiratory Virus PanelSingle-strandedZika virusThis work was funded by U.S. Navy, Office of Naval Research, In-House Laboratory Independent Research (ILIR) Program and WUN A1417.

To expand the range of viruses that could be detected, in this study those two probe panels were combined with new probes for 41 additional viruses that are of biosurveillance and biodefense concern, for a full panel targeting 83 diverse viruses (Table\u00a01). In order to test this newly expanded probe panel and to specifically assess the effect of hybridization-based viral enrichment on the sensitivity of HTS for detection of a single virus within a complex environmental sample, commercial bat guano was spiked with increasing concentrations of Influenza virus (IFV). Spiked samples were split into two parts each, with each part being processed in parallel with unbiased, shotgun sequencing versus target enrichment sequencing using an expanded panel of probes.Table 1\nViruses included in target enrichment panel\nAs expected, a dose-dependent effect in the proportion of sequencing reads derived from IFV was observed as the number of spiked genome copies increased (Fig.\u00a01a and Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S1), in both the unbiased shotgun sequence data as well as the virus enriched sequence data. However, in this context, hybridization-based target enrichment resulted in approximately 20- to 100-fold more sensitivity for detection of IFV as compared to detection via unbiased, shotgun sequencing. At the lowest concentration tested (1250 genome equivalents (GE) per mL), only 0.5% of sequencing reads produced by unbiased shotgun sequencing were derived from IFV (\u2018on target\u2019 reads), whereas by stark contrast, the majority of reads produced by target enrichment sequencing (54.4%) were derived from IFV.\n\nFig. 1\nHybridization-based enrichment enhances sensitivity of HTS for viral detection from complex samples. Known concentrations of IFV genomic RNA (gRNA) were spiked into complex matrices. Samples were split into two parts and processed in parallel via unbiased, shotgun sequencing or target enrichment sequencing in pools of four. a IFV was spiked into bat guano at increasing concentrations to simulate environmental-type samples. Shown here is the percentage of IFV-specific reads. b Increasing concentrations of IFV gRNA were spiked into total RNA derived from MERS-CoV cell culture lysate. MERS-CoV genomic material was present at a constant, high level amongst all samples. The average percentage of IFV and MERS-CoV virus-specific reads derived from three biological replicates is shown. Black bars denote standard error of the mean for each sample\nWe next tested the sensitivity for detection of three clinically-relevant viruses that can co-circulate in tropical regions, can present with similar symptoms, and can be difficult to detect at low titers [21]. Mock clinical samples were constructed containing combinations of ZIKV, CHIKV, and DENV at loads that correlate with real clinical loads from human specimens. Briefly, varying titers of ZIKV, Dengue virus 2 (DENV-2), and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) were spiked into RNA extracted from human serum, in duplicate, to create synthetic co-infection samples. Negative control samples consisted solely of RNA extracted from human serum. Viruses were spiked-in at concentrations corresponding to Ct values from standard curves generated via RT-qPCR. The targeted spike-in values were chosen based on reports in the literature for clinical samples containing each virus to mimic a realistic co-infection scenario [22\u201325]. Given that in the literature there is at least one report of clinical samples being probed singly rather than pooled and probed [9] and it is not well known how pooling may affect virus detection levels, in this experiment we also sought to evaluate whether probing singly or within a pool would affect our ability to identify virus. Therefore, total RNA extracted from these samples was probed singly (\u201cpool of 1\u201d) and also pooled in groups of four and 12 with singly-spiked and mock-spiked serum samples consisting of the other components of the pool. The resulting sequence reads were mapped to the reference genomes for each of these three viruses. In all cases, the three co-infecting viruses were able to be detected in each sample at relatively consistent proportions regardless of the number of samples within a pool (Fig.\u00a02a). Even DENV-2 was detectable within each sample it was spiked, despite the low concentration of viral RNA (estimated 100 genome equivalents per mL).\n\nFig. 2\nDiscrimination of ZIKV, CHIKV, and DENV in mock clinical samples at clinically relevant titers. Sequencing libraries made from serum samples spiked with ZIKV, DENV-2 and CHIKV were prepared in duplicate and either probed singly or within pools of four or 12. a The percentage of pathogen-specific reads detected within the synthetic co-infection samples is shown, along with the standard error of the mean for the two replicates. b-d Coverage plots demonstrating the number of reads that mapped to ZIKV, CHIKV, and DENV, respectively, as well as the distribution of those reads along the length of each genome\nIn addition to evaluating whether sensitivity and reproducibility are maintained despite multiplexing in pools of four and 12, we also sought to evaluate the probe panel\u2019s performance in the context of strain-level, and even species-level, genetic variation as well as differing concentrations of viral genetic material. Specifically, synthetic clinical samples were also constructed to contain a different strain of ZIKV than the strain the probes were designed against (strain R116265 rather than strain MR766, which is the strain whose reference genome was used for probe design; Fig.\u00a03a and b) and a different species of Human Adenovirus (HAdV) than the probes were designed to target (HAdV-51, a member of species D; as opposed to species C, B, and E, which the probes target specifically; Fig. 3g and h). These samples were also constructed to include biological replicates and were probed singly or in pools of four or 12. In all cases, the spiked-in virus was detectable, although there was some variation in depth of coverage among multiplexed samples. As might be expected, samples that were multiplexed in sets of 12 yielded the lowest depth of coverage compared to samples that were multiplexed in sets of four or probed singly (Fig. 3b, d, f). The target genomes were completely covered in the majority of on-target samples. The exception to this rich, consistent coverage included both strains of ZIKV, which, although both were detectable, did not achieve 100% linear coverage and exhibited lower depth of coverage than the other viruses that were spiked in at similar levels (Fig. 3b).\n\nFig. 3\nDetection of close relative viruses irrespective of extensive multiplexing.

Therefore, spiked samples were created using two serotypes of DENV with Ct values corresponding to low titer, and the samples were subjected to hybridization-based enrichment and sequencing. The resulting sequence reads were found to cover the entirety of each target genome, even for the samples corresponding to Ct value 32 (estimated 1000 genome equivalents per mL). A dose-dependent response was observed in the percentage of DENV-specific reads as the Ct value decreased (Fig.\u00a04a). For each serotype, the depth of coverage was greater than 50x even when the Ct value crossed 29 (Fig. 4b and c). As expected, the remaining reads that did not map to DENV-1 or DENV-2 were derived from human genes in spiked-in human serum RNA extract that were pulled down by the control probes, as well as the sequencing control library for PhiX.\n\nFig. 4\nRecovery of full DENV genome at titers below limit of detection by conventional shotgun HTS or amplicon-based sequencing.

Understanding the pathogenesis of chlamydial complications including the pathophysiological processes within the female host genital tract is important in preventing adverse pathology. MicroRNAs regulate several pathophysiological processes of infectious and non-infectious etiologies. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the miRNA profile of single and repeat genital chlamydial infections will be different and that these differences will be time dependent. Thus, we analyzed and compared differentially expressed mice genital tract miRNAs after single and repeat chlamydia infections using a C. muridarum mouse model. Mice were sacrificed and their genital tract tissues were collected at 1, 2, 4, and 8\u2009weeks after a single and repeat chlamydia infections. Histopathology, and miRNA sequencing were performed.Histopathology presentation showed that the oviduct and uterus of reinfected mice were more inflamed, distended and dilated compared to mice infected once. The miRNAs expression profile was different in the reproductive tissues after a reinfection, with a greater number of miRNAs expressed after reinfection. Also, the number of miRNAs expressed each week after chlamydia infection and reinfection varied, with weeks eight and one having the highest number of differentially expressed miRNAs for chlamydia infection and reinfection respectively. Ten miRNAs; mmu-miR-378b, mmu-miR-204-5p, mmu-miR-151-5p, mmu-miR-142-3p, mmu-miR-128-3p, mmu-miR-335-3p, mmu-miR-195a-3p, mmu-miR-142-5p, mmu-miR-106a-5p and mmu-miR-92a-3p were common in both primary chlamydia infection and reinfection. Pathway analysis showed that, amongst other functions, the differentially regulated miRNAs control\u00a0pathways involved in cellular and tissue development, disease conditions and toxicity.This study provides insights into the changes in miRNA expression over time after chlamydia infection and reinfection, as well as the pathways they regulate to determine pathological outcomes. The miRNAs networks generated in our study shows that there are differences in the focus molecules involved in significant biological functions in chlamydia infection and reinfection, implying that chlamydial pathogenesis occurs differently for each type of infection and that this could be important when determining treatments regime and disease outcome. The study underscores the crucial role of host factors in chlamydia pathogenesis.Chlamydia infection is one of the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection worldwide. The complications in women include endometritis, salpingitis, ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and tubal factor infertility (TFI) [1, 2]. Approximately one-third of PID attributed to Chlamydia trachomatis infection occurs mainly in reproductive-age women [3]. Several clinical syndromes are associated with PID caused by Chlamydia, which during physical examinations presents as pelvic or lower abdominal pain or uterine or adnexal tenderness [4]. Increased levels of inflammatory markers such as mucin 16, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, incidence of tubo-ovarian abscess, ectopic pregnancy, tubal infertility, Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome and longer hospitalization are also associated with genital chlamydia infection in acute PID [5].The developmental cycle of C. trachomatis alternates between the extracellular infectious elementary body and the intracellular, non-infectious reticulate body [6]. Columnar and transitional epithelial cells are the primary cells infected by Chlamydia [7]. C. trachomatis being an intracellular obligate parasite employs an array of host processes to support its developmental cycle [8]. This manipulation of host processes increases influx of innate cells, release of tissue damaging proteins and pro-inflammatory cytokines [8, 9]. The intense and chronic inflammatory response is maintained by reinfection or persistent infection in host cells with chlamydial infection ultimately leads to PID [2, 7, 8]. We have previously suggested that host inflammatory and antimicrobial immune responses to infection are important in determining Chlamydia-induced tubal pathology [10, 11]; therefore, balancing these two factors is important in controlling genital chlamydial infections and preventing the sequelae. The initiation of the pathologic process of epithelial-mesenchyme transition in host epithelial cells has been shown to be important during chlamydial infection [12, 13]. This process may progress to fibrosis and fertility-related epithelial dysfunction and provides the co-factor function for herpes virus (HPV)-related cervical epithelial carcinoma [13].Proposed mechanisms for the inflammatory response and sequalae in Chlamydia infected host cells includes presence of chlamydia proteins and small non-coding RNAs (miRNAs) belonging to the host expressed during Chlamydia trachomatis infection [10, 13\u201318]. miRNAs are evolutionarily conserved, endogenous non-coding RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides that play important regulatory roles in animals and plants by targeting mRNAs for degradation, cleavage, translational repression or occasional enhancement [19, 20]. miRNAs have been reported to account for approximately one-third of mammalian gene expression by regulating the expression of genes involved in cellular differentiation, maintenance of cellular integrity, development, functions and normal metabolism, reproduction, fibrosis and oncogenesis [21]. miRNAs have been shown to be differentially expressed during ocular chlamydia infection [22, 23]; in addition, we and other authors have shown an association between genital chlamydia infection and differential expression of miRNAs [10]. Furthermore, we showed a direct relationship between the integrity of Dicer, a ribonuclease III enzyme, and key micro-RNAs in the reproductive system [10]. Immune cell type-specific miRNAs appear to regulate the effective immune response to chlamydial infection [24]. The development of PID due to chlamydial infection with virulent and attenuated phenotypes can be predicted using miRNAs [17] with the Chlamydia virulence associated with the miRNA expression profile of the host [25]. miRNAs have also been associated with regulating mitochondrial function which is necessary for C. trachomatis development [26]. These studies buttress the importance of miRNAs as important factors in host cell changes and response during chlamydial infection.Although these findings show the importance of miRNAs expression in determining the outcome of chlamydial infections, they however, do not provide a full picture of the role miRNAs may play during chlamydial infection. For instance, they do not show the effect of Chlamydia trachomatis on miRNA expression over an extended period. The methods used to analyze genital tract miRNAs so far have not provided a detailed enumeration of all the known miRNAs associated with chlamydial infection. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the total miRNA expression profile using deep sequencing, in mice infected and reinfected with C. muridarum. C. muridarum mouse models results in genital tract infections that are similar to acute genital tract C. trachomatis infections in women. The infection in mice can cause hydrosalphinx, fibrosis and infertility, which are common in infected women [27\u201329]. Here, we report the expression profile of miRNAs in the female mouse genital tracts at one, two, four and 8\u00a0weeks after chlamydia infection and reinfection.Core analysis was performed on all miRNAs expressed after single C. muridarum infection and reinfection in the context of molecular network and biological processes in mice using the Diana-mirPath and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) algorithms. Using Diana-mirPath [30], our analysis showed that for the single infection, 57 pathways were predicted to be regulated by the differentially expressed miRNAs (Additional file\u00a01: Figure S3). The pathways included extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, leukocyte trans-endothelial migration, endometrial cancer, bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, PI3-AKT signaling, mTor signaling, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, and focal adhesion. 61 pathways were predicted to be regulated by the differentially expressed miRNAs after chlamydia reinfection (Additional file\u00a01: Figure S4). The pathways included T and B cell signaling, TGF-beta signaling, glioma, different forms of cancer, adherens junction, endocytosis, RNA degradation, bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, endometrial cancer, FC\u03c8 receptor (FC\u03c8R)-mediated phagocytosis, Wnt signaling and extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor interactions. More pathways were predicted to be regulated after reinfection due to the higher number of differentially expressed miRNAs, we further analysed our data using IPA, to determine if there were any subtle differences in these pathways in mice.During a single C. muridarum infection, the most significant pathways within the physiological systems development and functions category included organismal development and connective tissue development and function (Fig.\u00a05a; Additional file\u00a01: Table S1). The most significant pathways within the diseases and disorders category included cancer, organismal injury and abnormalities disease and reproductive system disease, these pathways had the same number [12] of miRNAs (Fig.\u00a05b; Additional file\u00a01: Table S1). The most significant pathways within the molecular and cellular functions included cellular development, cell cycle and cell-to-cell signaling and interaction (Fig.\u00a05 c; Additional file\u00a01: Table S1).During C. muridarum reinfection, the most significant pathways within the physiological system development and functions category included organ and connective tissue development (Fig.\u00a05a; Additional file\u00a01: Table S1). The most significant pathways within the diseases and disorders category included cancer, organismal injury and abnormalities disease (Fig.\u00a05b; Additional file\u00a01: Table S1). The most significant pathways within the molecular and cellular functions included, cellular development and cellular growth and proliferation (Fig.\u00a05c; Additional file\u00a01: Table S1). We did a further analysis of the regulated pathways and showed precisely the key steps where these miRNAs associated with chlamydia reinfection had been described to play a role (Additional file\u00a01: Table S2).We evaluated the top networks of miRNAs expressed during C. muridarum infection and generated two associated networks using IPA knowledge base. Network 1 consists of miRNAs and molecules associated with cancer, organismal Injury and abnormalities and reproductive system disease. We observed 10 focus molecules. The transcription factor CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein Alpha (CEBPA), was the central focus molecule. Network 2 consists of miRNAs and molecules associated organismal injury and abnormalities, reproductive system disease and cancer. There were 6 focus molecules. The transcription factor CAMP Responsive Element Binding Protein 1 (CREB1), was the central focus molecule (Additional file\u00a01: Figure S5A & B).We further evaluated the miRNAs networks expressed during C. muridarum reinfection and generated five associated network using IPA knowledge base (Additional file\u00a01: Figure S5C-G; Additional file\u00a01: Table S2). Network 1 consists of miRNAs and molecules associated with organismal injury and abnormalities, reproductive system disease and cancer. It has 11 focus molecules. The transcription factor Ras Homolog Family Member A (RHOA), was the central focus molecule. Network 2 consists of miRNAs and molecules associated organismal injury and abnormalities, reproductive system disease and cancer. It has 6 focus molecules. Mmu-miR-423-5p, was the central focus molecule (Additional file\u00a01: Figure S5C-G, Additional file\u00a01: Table S2). The results suggested that the miRNAs expression pattern after C. muridarum infection plays a role in the pathophysiologic processes associated with the infection.Understanding the role of host factors in the chlamydial pathogenesis is important in diagnosing infection associated complications and developing new treatments for them. In this study, we determined changes in miRNA expression after chlamydia infection and predicted the role miRNAs might play in disease outcome. Several studies have elucidated the role of miRNAs during chlamydia infection [10, 13, 17, 18, 22\u201326, 31]. These studies show that miRNAs are important factors in host cell changes and response during chlamydial infection. However, none of the studies on mice genital chlamydial infection have defined the full complement of miRNAs found within the genital tract. The current study was designed to sequence all the known miRNAs found within mice genital tract during chlamydial infection and reinfection. The results reported here are based on all known miRNAs found in the mouse genome. We determined the miRNA expression profiles at different time points after infection; from week 1 to 8. This was done to follow miRNAs progression with time and determine if the changes in miRNAs expression will coincide with pathological changes identified in the mice genital tract.Histopathological results showed that there was a significant difference in uterine tissue alterations between chlamydia infected and reinfected infected mice. Mice infected once with chlamydia had eosinophilic changes in the endometrium with lymphocytic inflammation associated with apoptotic necrosis, and these features increased over time. The uterus from chlamydia reinfected mice had increased tissue alterations such as formation of new fibrous tissues associated with inflammation, thickening of the lining of the uterus, apoptotic necrosis, and distension of the endometrium. However, there was no apparent association of the occurrence of these characteristics with time, although the the thickening of the endometrial lining was more prominent in the reinfection at week 8. This indicates that after the first infection, pathological changes increased in severity during the reinfection. This is similar to the reported pathologies in women, with increase in complications associated with chlamydia infection occurring in recurrent infections [32].Here we provide a further insight into the role played by miRNAs during genital chlamydial infection by providing miRNAs associated with disease progression. In addition, we depict the possible pathways associated with the differential expression of these miRNAs during chlamydial infection. In this study, we utilized next generation sequencing (NGS); the best method for determining the miRNAs expression. NGS has several advantages over microarray or quantitative (q) PCR-based miRNA expression profiling techniques. This includes, high sensitivity to determining miRNA levels over a wide dynamic range, ability to identify novel miRNAs and to detect miRNA expression levels in species for which complete genomes are not yet available. In addition, NGS can detect miRNAs that differ by just one nucleotide. Multiplexing of samples by tagging libraries with barcodes during library preparation is possible in NGS. However, NGS is expensive even though the price is decreasing [33, 34]. The sequences identified from the NGS were subsequently analyzed using the comprehensive analysis pipeline for miRNA-sequence data (CAP-miRSeq), which is a powerful and flexible tool used to process and analyze miRNA-seq data [35]. This study offers evidence that miRNAs differentially expressed during chlamydia infection and reinfection differ in number, types and regulatory pathways in a time dependent manner.Initial cluster analysis show a difference in miRNA expression during chlamydia infection and reinfection at weeks one, two, four and eight after chlamydial infection. Other studies have looked at earlier time points (1\u2009week to 12\u2009days) of a single infection [17, 18, 25] or only during a second infection [10]. Here we report that there is a difference in the miRNA signature based on the number of chlamydial infections. During single chlamydia infection, 11 miRNAs were up-regulated while 10 miRNAs were down-regulated. During the chlamydia reinfection, 20 miRNAs were up-regulated while 45 miRNAs were down-regulated. We have shown in previous studies that more miRNAs are downregulated during genital chlamydia infection than are upregulated, and we related these changes in differential expression to increased expression of genes associated with fibrosis, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, cell proliferation, growth and differentiation [10, 36]. Gupta et al., also showed that several miRNAs are down regulated during chlamydia infection [18]. However, in ocular chlamydia infection there appears to be more upregulation of miRNAs than down regulation [23]. Our findings confirm that there is a alteration in the miRNAs profile during chlamydia infection and reinfection. In addition, we provide information on the miRNA profile after chlamydia infection and reinfection over an extended period (8\u2009weeks). Our data shows that more miRNAs were differentially expressed in the 8\u00a0week of the first infection and the second week of reinfection. This correlated with the progression of pathological changes which we had noticed during the first infection. In the repeat infection, after the second week, we did not notice appreciable changes in pathology. This implies an association between pathology and the number of differentially expressed miRNAs at those timepoints. Selection of miRNAs based on FDR has given us an insight into the miRNAs associated with pathogenesis caused by Chlamydia. Thus we can imply that the difference in miRNA expression profile and number during chlamydia infection and reinfection could be as a result of regulation through the quick induction of adaptive and protective immunity against Chlamydia [27, 37].Pathway analysis shows that miRNAs expressed in chlamydia infection and reinfection are involved in regulating several pathways from extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, leukocyte trans-endothelial migration, bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, phosphoinositide 3-kinase - protein kinase B (PI3-AKT) signaling, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor) signaling, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, focal adhesion, T and B cell signaling, Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling, glioma, different forms of cancer, adherens junction, endocytosis, RNA degradation, FC\u03c8R-mediated phagocytosis and Wnt signaling. Chlamydia reinfection had more pathways because more miRNAs were differentially expressed after repeat infection. Using IPA we were able to discern differences in networks between chlamydia infection and reinfection involving the cancer, organismal Injury and abnormalities and reproductive system disease, where the networks had different focal molecules. Indicating that the pathogenesis in chlamydia infection and reinfection follow different paths.Use of miRNAs to understand the pathogenesis of Chlamydia is important, our results have some similarities with work previously done, we observed mmu-miR-142 [23, 25]; mmu-miR-146 [18]; mmu-miR-147 [22]; mmu-miR-199b, mmu-miR-142-3p, mmu-miR-204, mmu-miR-449a-5p, mmu-miR-101, mmu-miR-340 [10]. Our previous study [10] had the closest resemblance to our present data with 5 miRNAs being similar. We had reported miRNAs expressed after a reinfection and our present data shows that more miRNAs are differentially expressed during chlamydia reinfection. However, it should be noted that we had used Lymphogranuloma venereum instead of C. muridarum. During a single chlamydia infection, we observed two miRNAs (mmu-miR-378b and mmu-miR-151-5p) changed direction in their differential expression. miRNA-378b has been shown to be important in regulating epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation, fibrosis and aromatase expression in the genital tract [38\u201345]. miR-151-5p regulates tumor cell migration and spread; it is blocked by Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor alpha (Rho GDI alpha), and associated with the focal adhesion kinase gene [46, 47]. It positively regulates cell apoptosis by targeting the expression of tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 10 (TNFSF10) and fibronectin type III domain containing 1 (FNDC1) in mice with premature ovarian failure [48]. The increased pathology including increased migration of eosinophils/neutrophils and lessions that increased with time after single chlamydia infection might be associated with the expression of mmu-miR-378b and mmu-miR-151-5p. During chlamydia reinfection, the formation of new fibrous tissues associated with inflammation, thickening of the lining of the uterus, apoptotic necrosis, and distension of the endometrium noticed 4\u2009weeks after infection might be associated with the down regulation of mmu-miR-378b, mmu-miR-146a-5p, mmu-miR-20b-5p, mmu-miR-142-5p, mmu -miR-142-3p and mmu-miR-106a-5p. These miRNAs have been associated with EMT and fibrosis [49\u201354], which we have hypothesized and shown as being important in the damage to the genital tract during chlamydia pathogenesis [10, 13, 36]. These miRNAs are also associated with cancer [49\u201352, 54], recently a relationship between chlamydia and ovarian cancer was described [55]. In addition we observed that miR-204-5p, miR-151-5p, miR-378b, miR-142-3p, miR-128-3p, miR-335-3p, miR-142-5p, miR-106a-5p, miR-195a-3p and miR-92a-3p were common in both infections. miR-204 targets Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), and regulates epithelial to mesenchymal transition by targetting Specificity Protein 1 (SP1) in tubular epithelial cells; regulates protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and unfolded protein response [56\u201358], which we have shown to involved in chlamydial pathogenesis [59]; miR-106a-5p suppress the proliferation, migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells, and is a good predictor of prognosis in hepatocellular cancer [60, 61]; miR-195a-3p targets matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) in murine mesenchymal stem cells thus inhibiting angiogenesis [62]. MMP2 expression in wild type mice oviduct increases by day 7 after chalmydia infection [63]. miR-92a-3p is significantly expressed in cervical cancer tissue cell lines thus promoting cervical cancer cell proliferation, cell cycle transition from gap 1 (G1) to synthesis (S) phase and invasion [64]. Intrestingly, it has been reported in dual RNA-Seq analyses of in vitro chlamydia infected epithelial cells, that infected epithelial cells expressed aberrant immune dampening and fibrotic responses, which included increased expression of TGF-beta, MMP2 and other ECM proteins [65]. Our results show that the miRNAs identified in this study control the expression of genes linked to chlamydial pathogenesis. Therefore, we speculate that we can use these miRNAs as indicators of chlamydial pathogeneses and maybe even a biomarker for disease leading to PID and infertility. It should be pointed out that the literature is strewn with cancer associated miRNAs and it is possible that associations with cancer noticed in this study maybe cursory.The findings from our study show that chlamydial infection induces differentially expressed miRNAs that play a significant role in organismal injuries and abnormalities, cellular development, reproductive disorders, cell cycle, inflammatory response, fibrosis, cancer and connective tissue disorders. The targets and pathway analyses indicate that specific miRNAs are involved in the primary infection and reinfection, although there were overlaps. In addition, our results are corroborated by previous human research findings that have established an association between recurrent or persistent endocervical chlamydial infection in women and an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease and scarring sequelae in the upper genital tract, which have also been demonstrated in several animal models [2, 32]. This study highlights the need to further study the association of genital Chlamydia infection with the promotion of cancer in women, because several miRNAs in this study having been associated with cancer in other studies [46, 50, 60, 61, 64, 66]. The highly interconnected networks of miRNAs generated from our data shows that there are differences in the focus molecules involved in significant biological functions during chlamydia infection and reinfection, implying that chlamydial pathogenesis may be distinct for each type of infection and that this could be important when determining treatments regime and disease outcome. Despite the strengths of our study, involving: a) next generation sequencing, b) a single infection and reinfection, and c) sample collection up to 8\u2009weeks after infection, it has some limitations. We did not carry out a third infection or assess the effects of antibiotics treatment on each infection, all of which may play a role in miRNA expression and pathogenesis in human infections. Although only certain aspects of the pathogenesis of chlamydial infection in the mice model mirror the human infection [2], our findings show the importance of miRNAs regulation and expression in chlamydial infection and pathogenesis, which has implications for humans. In summary, our study findings provides substantial evidence that miRNAs regulate the host responses and biological processes that are associated with Chlamydia pathogenesis.The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM-IACUC) approved the animal care and use protocol (# 16\u201324), which we followed in this study. MSM-IACUC adheres to the Natinal Institute of Health (NIH) guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals, with Public Health Service (PHS) policy, and the Animal Welfare Act.Stocks of Chlamydia muridarum Nigg (the agent of mouse pneumonitis) used for infections were prepared by propagating elementary bodies (EBs) in McCoy or HeLa cells (Division of Scientific Research, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta), according to standard procedures. Chlamydia stock titers were expressed as inclusion-forming units (IFU) per milliliter [67].Female C57BL/6 J wild type mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, MA), fed food and provided water ad libitum, and maintained in laminar flow racks under pathogen-free conditions with a 12\u2009h light and 12\u2009h dark cycle. The protocols involving mice were approved by MSM-IACUC. For all invasive procedures mice were anesthesized using isoflurane. Mice were placed in a chamber with 2\u20134% gas concentration of isoflurane in a fume hood for 30\u2009min. Mice were euthanized using carbon dioxide asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation. This method of euthanasia is recommended by the Panel on Euthanasia of the American Veterinary Medical Association.6\u20138\u2009weeks old Female C57BL/6 [40] were infected and reinfected (interval of 4-weeks) intravaginally with 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 IFU /mouse of live C. muridarum approximately 7\u2009days after administration of 2.5\u2009mg/mouse Depo Provera (medroxy-progesterone Acetate; Pfizer Inc., NY). Control mice [40] were sham infected with sterile PBS approximately 7\u2009days after administration of 2.5\u2009mg/mouse Depo Provera. Mice were determined to be infected by periodic cervicovaginal swabbing and isolation of Chlamydia in tissue culture.Histopathology of the genital tract associated with chlamydial infection was investigated. 40 mice were infected and reinfected intravaginally with C. muridarum (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 IFU per mouse) approximately 7\u2009days after administration of 2.5\u2009mg/mouse Depo Provera (medroxy-progesterone Acetate; Pfizer Inc., NY). The entire genital tract from the vagina to the ovary was collected from infected and control mice mice at one, two, four and 8\u00a0weeks after infection (5 mice per time point) and fixed in 10% formaldehyde. The samples were embedded in paraffin, cut longitudinally into 5\u2009\u03bcm sections to include the cervix, uterine horns, oviducts and ovaries as well as the luminal structures, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Blinded to group designations, a board-certified pathologist (UBM) evaluated the uteri, oviducts and ovaries for the presence of lesions including, but not limited to inflammation, edema, fibrosis, and luminal distension. Lesions were recorded as either absent or present. If absent (i.e., histologically normal), a score of 0 was assigned. If present, the severity of the lesions was recorded as minimal, mild, moderate, or severe, with severity scores of 1 through 4, respectively. Lesion distribution was recorded as focal, multifocal, or diffuse, with distribution scores of 1, 2, or 3, respectively. A total severity-and-distribution group score was calculated by adding individual distribution and severity scores. Because the group sizes were uneven, an average severity-and-distribution group score was calculated by dividing the total severity-and-distribution score by the numbers of animals in the group. Note that control and infected mice were from the same batch of mice and that each time point had its own control group.Genital tract samples were harvested after sacrificing infected and control mice mice at one, two, four and 8\u00a0weeks after infection (5 mice per time point) and frozen immediately on dry ice and then transferred to a\u2009\u2212\u200980 freezer. For non-biased recovery of miRNA, total RNA was isolated using the Direct-zol RNA miniprep (Zymo Research, Irvine CA). RNA integrity was assessed using the Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer. Samples were submitted to the University of Georgia Georgia Genomic and Bioinformatic Core (GGBC) for library preparation with the the TruSeq Small RNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Samples were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument using a SE75 run High Output flow cell (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), inserts used were 25\u201375 bases. This assay was validated using qPCR (Additional file\u00a01: Figure S7A & B). Note that control and infected mice were from the same batch of mice and that each time point had its own control group.NGS data analyses were performed by the GGBC. Quality of raw sequence reads was assessed using FastQC [68] (sequencing depth\u2009\u2265\u20094 million reads). The data were mapped to the M. musculus mm10 reference genome and to the MirDeep mouse miRNA database for identifying novel and known miRNA\u2019s, respectively, using the CAP-miRSeq pipeline (version 1.1) [35]. The pipeline leverages several software packages for adapter removal and trimming, read alignment and manipulation of sequence alignment map/binary alignment map (SAM/BAM) and fastq/fasta files (Additional file\u00a01: Figure S8) and implements edgeR for differential expression analysis of counts per million (cpm) normalized count data. Sequences with a perfect match or one mismatch were retained for further analysis. Differential miRNA expression profiling included fold difference estimates between different treatment and time course comparisons as well as P-values and false discovery rate (FDR) determinations for each differentially expressed species. Target identification of genes putatively regulated by miRNAs was performed using TargetScan [69]. Heatmaps were generated for differentially expressed miRNAs in each set of comparisons using R. Visualization of overlapping expression among miRNAs identified at different infection timepoints was done using Venny 2.0, an interactive Venn diagram tool for comparing name lists of up to 4 genomic datasets [70]. Software parameters and tools can be found in the Additional\u00a0file\u00a01.Pathway, Core and Comparison analyses for all the FDR corrected differentially expressed miRNAs irrespective of time points in infected and reinfected mice were analyzed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (Qiagen Inc.) and Daina MirPath [30]. The top networks, molecular and cellular functions, diseases and disorders and physiological system development and functions were determined using Ingenuity System Interactive Pathway Systems (version 18,488,943). Stringency was set at \u2018highly predicted\u2019 and \u2018experimentally validated\u2019. The software uses its own internal algorithm and other databases, including TarBase, TargetScan and miRecords, as well as findings published in the literature. Complete reference set for this analysis was carried out using the Ingenuity Knowledge Base (Genes+ Endogenous Chemicals) for all molecules associated with diseases, functions, pathway, or list annotations.This study focused on the top networks, molecular and cellular functions, diseases and disorders and physiological system development and functions for each infection. Confidence was set at \u2018moderately predicted\u2019, \u2018highly predicted\u2019 and \u2018experimentally validated. A threshold value of \u2013log (p-value) between 1.33 and 21.45 was set to identify molecules whose expression was significantly differentially regulated. The right-tailed Fisher\u2019s exact test was used to calculate a p-value determining the probability that each biological function and/or disease assigned to that data set is due to chance alone [71]. IPA library of canonical pathways that were most significant to the infected and reinfected mice microRNA data set were carried out. Comparison analysis, which analyzed the changes in miRNA expression across observations recorded, was also performed. Graphical representation of the networks generated using molecular relationships between molecules and miRNAs expressed were generated using the IPA software. Molecules are represented as nodes, and the biological relationship between two nodes is represented as an edge (line). All edges are supported by at least one reference from the literature, from a textbook, or from canonical information stored in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base. Nodes are displayed using various shapes that represent the functional class of the gene product.Quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR was performed to validate differentially-expressed miRNAs discovered through the deep sequencing. cDNA synthesis and qRT-PCR was performed using Exiqon qPCR microRNA assays kits (Exiqon, Woburn, MA) per the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The cycle threshold (Ct) values and the relative expression of miRNAs in infected and control samples were normalized to U6 miRNA expression. The qRT-PCR data was analyzed using the delta-delta- Ct (ddCT) method [10].The data derived from non-sequencing experiments were analyzed and compared by performing a 1- or 2-tailed t-test, and the relationship between different experimental groupings was assessed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Statistical significance was judged at P\u2009<\u20090.05.Protein kinase BAnalysis of varianceBinary alignment mapComprehensive analysis pipeline for miRNA-sequence dataComplementary DNACCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein AlphaCounts per millionCAMP Responsive Element Binding Protein 1Cycle thresholddelta-delta- CtElementary bodiesExtra cellular matrixEpithelial to mesenchymal transitionFCy receptorFalse discovery rateFigurefibronectin type III domain containing 1Gap 1 stageGene Expression OmnibusGeorgia Genomic and Bioinformatics CoreHematoxylin and eosinherpes virusInstitutional Animal Care and Use CommitteeInclusion-forming unitsIngenuity pathway analysis softwareJanus kinase 2MicroRNA(s)miRNA-sequencingMatrix metallopeptidase 2Morehouse School of Medicinemammalian target of rapamycinNational Center for Biotechnology InformationNext generation sequencingNational Institute of Child Health and Human DevelopmentNational Institute of General Medical SciencesNational Institute of HealthNational Institute on Minority Health and Health DisparitiesProtein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinasePublic Health ServicePhosphoinositide 3-kinasePelvic inflammatory diseaseQuantitative PCRQuantitative real time PCRRho GDP dissociation inhibitor alphaRas Homolog Family Member ARibonucleic acidSynthesis stageSequence alignment mapSpecificity Protein 1Tubal factor infertilityTransforming growth factor betaTumor necrosis factor superfamily member 10This work was supported by NIH grant 8G12MD007602 from the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD), 1SC1AII03041-01A1 from National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) to Q.H. and 1SC2HD086066-01A1 from Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) to Y.O.

Significant findings were mainly detected in the uterus. When compared to controls, mice infected once had a number of lesions that increased with time, meaning that more lessions were formed in mice genital tracts as the infection progressed. The pathologic findings varied from eosinophilic changes in the endometrium to lymphocytic inflammation, with associated apoptotic necrosis of endometrial epithelia (Fig.\u00a01a-f). Reinfected mice had an increased number of tissue alterations in the uterus and oviduct, compared to control mice. The number of lesions was not associated with time (Fig.\u00a02a-f), but included periglandular inflammation with and without the formation of new fibrous tissue (periglandular fibroplasia) (Fig.\u00a02b and c). The character of the periglandular inflammation was predominantly lymphocytic and plasmacytic, with formation of lymphoid follicles (Fig.\u00a02f). In addition, there was thickening of the lining of the uterus, apoptotic necrosis, and distension of the endometrium (Fig.\u00a03b and c). The results suggested that regulated pathophysiologic processes were induced during a primary and repeat genital chlamydial infection.\n\nFig. 1\nHistopathological assessment of genital tract of mice infected once with Chlamydia. a.

We analyzed the miRNA sequencing data and observed that there were more miRNA differentially expressed in reinfection compared to single infection, however in both cases more miRNAs were down regulated during C. muridarum infection than were upregulated (Fig.\u00a04a-g; Tables\u00a01,\u00a02,\u00a03). The number of miRNAs that were differentially expressed varied based on the time after infection when the samples were collected. After a single infection, the highest number of differentially expressed miRNAs was observed in week 8. However, after reinfection weeks 1 and 2 had the highest number of differentially expressed miRNAs (Fig.\u00a04e and f; S. Figs.\u00a01 and\u00a02; Table\u00a01). To eliminate any chance of having false positives in the miRNA analysis, we performed a false discovery rate (FDR) analysis. This analysis reduced the number of miRNAs that were significantly differentially expressed. In all, 21 miRNAs in total were significantly expressed after a single infection, most of these miRNAs have human homologs The log fold changes ranged from \u2212\u20094.83 to 2.93. Some miRNAs appeared more than once (mmu-miR-378b and mmu-miR-151-5p). miR-3470b was the most upregulated miRNA, while mmu-miR-378b was the most down regulated miRNA. Interestingly, mmu-miR-378b was upregulated in week 1 after infection and then downregulated in week 8 (Fig.\u00a04e; Table\u00a02). After FDR corrected analysis we obsevered that 66 miRNAs were significantly expressed during chlamydia reinfection, most of these miRNAs have human homologs. Six of the miRNAs; mmu-miR-378b, mmu-miR-106a, mmu-miR-142-3p, mmu-miR-142-5p, mmu-miR-20b-5p, mmu-miR-146a-5p; appeared more than once. Log fold changes ranged from \u2212\u20095.14 to 3.19 (Fig.\u00a04f; Table\u00a03). mmu-miR-378b was the most upregulated miRNA, while mmu-miR-205-5p was the most down regulated miRNA (Table\u00a03). Similar to what we observed after a single infection, mmu-miR-378b fold change value decreased as the infection progressed from week 1 to week 8. Ten miRNAs were found to be common in chlamydia infection and reinfection. These microRNAs are mmu-miR-378b, mmu-miR-204-5p, mmu-miR-151-5p, mmu-miR-142-3p, mmu-miR-128-3p, mmu-miR-335-3p, mmu-miR-195a-3p, mmu-miR-142-5p, mmu-miR-106a-5p and mmu-miR-92a-3p (Fig.\u00a04g). The results suggested that these changes in miRNAs might be associated with the pathological changes that we had observed in the primary C. muridarum infection and reinfection, there is a need to understand what pathways they control.\n\nFig. 4\nHeat map and Cluster analysis showing the numbers of differentially expressed miRNAs after chlamydia infection and reinfection. a.

We focused on four categories when assessing the effects of C. muridarum on the differential expression on miRNAs; physiological system development, diseases and disorders, molecular and cellular functions, and toxicity functions. In pathways associated with physiological system development, the results show that there were differences in pathways regulating organ development, organismal development and connective tissue development & function after chlamydia infection and reinfection (Fig.\u00a05a). In diseases and disorders associated pathways, there were differences in pathways regulating tumorigenesis or cancer, organismal injury & abnormalities disease and reproductive system disease after chlamydia infection and reinfection (Fig.\u00a05b). In pathways associated with molecular and cellular functions the results show that there were differences after a single chlamydia infection and reinfection especially in cellular development, cell cycle, and cellular growth and proliferation.

Comprehensive Analysis Pipeline for miRNA-seq data (CAP-miRSeq), adapted from Sun et al., 2014 [35]. (PDF 1710 kb)", "s12864-019-5517-4": "Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a broad-host range necrotrophic pathogen which is the causative agent of Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR), and a major disease of soybean (Glycine max). A time course transcriptomic analysis was performed in both compatible and incompatible soybean lines to identify pathogenicity and developmental factors utilized by S. sclerotiorum to achieve pathogenic success.A comparison of genes expressed during early infection identified the potential importance of toxin efflux and nitrogen metabolism during the early stages of disease establishment. The later stages of infection were characterized by an apparent shift to survival structure formation. Analysis of genes highly upregulated in-planta revealed a temporal regulation of hydrolytic and detoxification enzymes, putative secreted effectors, and secondary metabolite synthesis genes. Redox regulation also appears to play a key role during the course of infection, as suggested by the high expression of genes involved in reactive oxygen species production and scavenging. Finally, distinct differences in early gene expression were noted based on the comparison of S. sclerotiorum infection of resistant and susceptible soybean lines.Although many potential virulence factors have been noted in the S. sclerotiorum pathosystem, this study serves to highlight soybean specific processes most likely to be critical in successful infection. Functional studies of genes identified in this work are needed to confirm their importance to disease development, and may constitute valuable targets of RNAi approaches to improve resistance to SSR.Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, the causative agent of Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR) or white mold, is a broad host range necrotrophic fungus that infects soybean (Glycine max) as well as more than 400 other species of plants worldwide [1]. With conducive environmental conditions SSR can be a devastating disease, and from 2010 to 2014 caused an estimated yield loss in the northern United States and Ontario of over 100 million bushels [2]. Along with yield losses, SSR affects seed quality by reducing protein and oil contents [3].The primary source of inoculum for S. sclerotiorum during seasonal crop infection cycles are sclerotia [4, 5]. Sclerotia are melanized hyphal aggregates that serve as a winter survival structure for the pathogen. These structures can undergo either myceliogenic germination, through the production of vegetative hyphae, or carpogenic germination, through the production of apothecia, the latter of which accounts for most soybean infections [6]. In the case of carpogenic germination, apothecia in the soil release millions of airborne ascospores which initially colonize the petals of soybean blossoms, before travelling through green tissue to the main stem of the plant. This journey through distinct regions of the host is important to note as the metabolic, virulence, and defense requirements of S. sclerotiorum may shift in response to the challenges associated with colonizing specific tissue types, such as differing levels of glucose [7], pH [8], and oxidative stress [9].While several factors implicated in S. sclerotiorum pathogenicity have been characterized (Oxalic acid [10\u201314], secreted effectors [15\u201318], cell wall degrading (CWD) enzymes [19\u201321]), bioinformatic approaches have identified additional putative secreted proteins in S. sclerotiorum that may serve as virulence factors. Guyon et al [22] identified 78 effector candidates through the analysis of protein domains and motifs, signatures of positive selection, recent gene duplication, and sequences unique to S. sclerotiorum. Of these candidates, a subset were analyzed during penetration and colonization of Arabidopsis thaliana, and showed distinct patterns of expression, likely correlating with their diverse roles in infection. A comparative analysis of the genomes of S. sclerotiorum and its close relative Botrytis cinerea provided insight into their putative secretomes, but also highlighted many of the numerous hydrolytic, detoxifying, and secondary metabolite synthesizing enzymes that S. sclerotiorum may use during infection [23].Although these studies have borne fruit through the identification and characterization of a number of potential virulence determinants [15, 18], in planta transcriptomic studies of S. sclerotiorum are pivotal to understanding the fungal pathogenicity determinants most important for a particular host and stage of infection. Previous studies attempting this in Brassica napus [24] and Phaseolus vulgaris [25] provide useful insight into the regulation of these determinants. The expression of a gene (Ssoah1) coding for an oxaloacetate acetylhydrolase, an enzyme essential in oxalic acid production, and likely the most well-studied virulence factor of S. sclerotiorum, was found to be similarly upregulated over the course of infection in both studies. Conversely, the expression and profiles of pectinolytic cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs) which are critical in fungal necrotrophy, such as polygalacturonases (PGs) [19], were differentially regulated between these two hosts. As a broad host range pathogen, S. sclerotiorum is capable of adapting to different hosts [26], and the characterization of host specific factors in any given crop system is essential to improve and exploit mechanisms of resistance.Although integrated management strategies for the control of SSR in soybean are common, a historical limitation to disease control has been a lack of cultivars showing strong physiological resistance [27]. This is complicated by a polygenic resistance composed of both physiological mechanisms of resistance and structural disease avoidance traits (i.e. height, lodging, canopy closure, etc.) which might prove inconsistent with variable environmental and field conditions [28]. Recently, attempts to classify cultivars demonstrating physiological resistance using greenhouse inoculations [27] and a panel of S. sclerotiorum isolates for improved SSR screening [29] have identified selections showing promising resistance. In this study, we capitalize on this selection work to compare transcriptional differences between a successful/compatible S. sclerotiorum infection in a susceptible soybean line and one encountering localized resistance after the onset of infection.To observe the changes in gene expression of S. sclerotiorum over the course of plant colonization, this study has three primary objectives: (1) identify differentially expressed genes over the course of infection in a susceptible soybean line; (2) compare gene expression in S. sclerotiorum in planta and under culture conditions to identify factors important in the S. sclerotiorum-soybean pathosystem; and (3) evaluate the differences in gene regulation during SSR infection on susceptible and resistant soybean lines.Global gene expression changes in S. sclerotiorum were determined following inoculations of the S and R lines. We sequenced the mRNA of twenty-four samples, consisting of three independent biological replicates of culture controls and infected soybean tissue at 24, 48, and 96 hpi. A total of 64.9\u201389.7 million raw reads were generated in each time point of the study, with 3.5 to 27% mapping to the genome of S. sclerotiorum and 68.9 to 92.8% mapping to the genome of Glycine max. On average, 96.3% of the total sequenced reads from the culture controls mapped uniquely to S. sclerotiorum strain 1980 genome. All reads that failed to map to either the host or pathogen genome were excluded from the analysis.Broad gene categorizations are often helpful in interpreting large transcriptomic data sets, but the important roles of individual genes can often be lost within the global view. To address this, up- and downregulated genes were manually analyzed using Protein BLAST (blastp). The two LATE genes most differentially expressed over the course of infection (logFC\u2009=\u20097.3\u20137.9) were surprisingly not classical virulence genes, but development-specific fungal lectins referred to as Ssp1 (Sscle10g079320) and Ssa (Sscle01g001830) (Additional file 2: Table S2). The precise function of these lectins is unknown, but both were found to be abundant in sclerotia, and their upregulation late in infection may indicate a shift towards sclerotial formation [33, 34]. Sixteen genes, including Ssp1 and Ssa, which were up-regulated late during infection, were also identified in a previous proteomic analysis as highly abundant gene products in the liquid exudates of S. sclerotiorum sclerotia [35] (Additional file 5: Table S4). The overlap of these genes upregulated at 96 hpi and the abundance of their products in sclerotial exudates provides evidence that the pathogen is likely shifting focus at the later stages of infection from virulence/colonization to survival structure formation.Three of the EARLY genes which are upregulated during early infection make up the critical components of nitrate metabolism in S. sclerotiorum (Additional file 2: Table S2). These genes, consisting of a nitrate transporter (Sscle02g013580) which transports nitrate into the cytoplasm, a nitrate reductase (Sscle01g005230) that converts nitrate to nitrite, and a nitrite reductase (Sscle02g016460) which converts nitrite to ammonia, are most highly expressed during early infection and show a steep reduction in expression by 96 hpi (logFC\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20092.25-3). The potential importance of nitrogen metabolism in early infection is similarly reflected in the early upregulation of S. sclerotiorum\u2019s urea active transporter (Sscle05g043930) and urease (Sscle05g047190) as well. This early expression pattern may be the result of relatively low nitrogen availability for the pathogen following penetration.Of the CWDEs, those showing pectinolytic activity, such as endo- or exo-polygalacturonases (PGs), have garnered particular attention given their demonstrated importance in virulence across a range of fungal pathogens [19, 36, 37]. S. sclerotiorum\u2019s genome contains nine previously identified PGs: Sspg1 (Sscle16g108170), Sspg2 or Sspg1b (Sscle03g022740), Sspg3 (Sscle09g070580), Sspg5 (Sscle02g018820), Sspg6 (Sscle12g088720), Ssxpg1 (Sscle02g018610), Ssxpg2 (Sscle04g035440), and two uncharacterized putative exo-polygalacturonases (Sscle05g046840 and Sscle05g040500) [19, 20]. The upregulation of all 9 putative S. sclerotiorum PGs can be seen as the infection progresses, with the exception of Sspg1, Sspg3, and Sscle05g046840, which are expressed consistently at all timepoints (Average logFCs\u2009=\u2009~\u20098, ~\u20095.5, and ~\u20094.5, respectively), all other PGs show the greatest upregulation at 96 HPI (Additional file 7: Table S6).During S. sclerotiorum infection on many hosts, the cuticle constitutes the first physical barrier to pathogen invasion. Given the nature of the cut-petiole inoculation technique used in this study, cutinase activity may not be required. However, most of the putative cutinases were either consistently induced at relatively high levels throughout infection (Sscle11g084380 and Sscle15g102320) or most induced at 96 HPI after the infection reached the main stem (Sscle02g011950) (Additional file 7: Table S6). Whether this is due to a consistent need to form lesions on the surface of the plant or a secondary purpose, such as interactions with other hydrophobic lipid substrates during colonization is unknown.Proteases are hydrolytic enzymes which have been shown to act as important virulence factors in a variety of fungal plant pathogens through the degradation of proteins involved in the immune response of the host [38]. A total of 34 proteases were upregulated during this study (Additional file 7: Table S6). During early infection, a previously characterized non-aspartyl acid protease (acp1; Sscle11g082980) was found to be the most upregulated (logFC\u2009=\u20096.22 at 24 hpi) [39]. The largest group of proteases induced during infection were serine proteases, which were categorized as either carboxypeptidases, subtilisin-like proteins, or tripeptidyl peptidases, the latter two of which both belong to the subtilisin superfamily. Serine proteases have been characterized as virulence determinants in a large number of phytopathogenic fungi [40\u201342] and of the 17 serine proteases identified in this analysis, all 17 showed the highest expression at the initial stages of infection (24 hpi). Two other proteases were also upregulated during infection and are homologous to proteases involved in pathogenesis. An aspartyl (acid) protease, Sscle04g035550, was upregulated at all timepoints and was found to contain a SAPs domain (cd05474) commonly associated with plant pathogenic protease activity [43]. Another aspartate protease, Sscle07g058540, was the second most upregulated protease at 24 hpi and shows homology to several aspergillopepsin-like proteins (cd06097) whose activity is important in invasive aspergillosis of humans [44] (Additional file 7: Table S6).Many genes related to secondary metabolite (SM) synthesis and detoxification were up-regulated during at least one time-point of the infection. Although the function of a vast majority of these SMs is unknown, extensive study of S. sclerotiorum\u2019s close relative Botrytis cinerea as well as other fungal pathogens have characterized many as phytotoxic and/or important in pathogenesis [45, 46]. Polyketide synthase (PKS) and Non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) appear to be the major enzymes associated with SM synthesis in S. sclerotiorum, and make-up 66.6 and 22.2%, respectively, of the SM synthesis genes found to be positively regulated in this study. Two PKSs (SsPKS4: Sscle05g048020 and SsPKS11: Sscle15g105000) were expressed to higher levels at all timepoints after inoculation, as compared to the in vitro control. Two other PKSs (SsPKS10: Sscle04g032810 and SsPKS15: Sscle14g097860), which saw no induction during the infection of B. napus [24], were highly up-regulated (logFC\u2009=\u2009~\u20094) at 24 HPI, indicating a possible role in early infection of soybean. A single phytoene synthase (SsPHS1: Sscle02g017510) was also upregulated at all timepoints (Additional file 8: Table S7).Although PKSs and NRPSs are the primary genes involved in SM synthesis, cytochrome P450s (CYP450s) play a pivotal role in both the biosynthesis of fungal mycotoxins and the detoxification of host metabolites through the conversion of potentially toxic compounds to more hydrophilic derivatives [47, 48]. A large number of CYP450s were positively regulated at some timepoint of the soybean infection, with 16.2% (6/37) and 37.8% (14/37) of the genes showing up-regulation at only 24 and 96 hpi, respectively. The most up-regulated CYP450 at 24 and 48 hpi was Sscle04g033880, a gene showing homology to pisatin demethylase in Aspergillus lentulus (Additional file 9: Table S8). Another CYP450, Sscle08g067130, was highly induced throughout infection of both B. napus [24] and in this study in soybean, indicating a potentially conserved requirement during infection of both crops, whereas Sscle05g045810, which was highly upregulated at all timepoints during this study, upregulation of this gene was not observed during B. napus infection. [24] (Additional file 9: Table S8).Along with the multifaceted role of CYP450\u2019s in SM metabolism, fungal pathogens require a suite of other enzymes to detoxify the fungicidal metabolites released by their hosts. This can be achieved through enzymatic modification of the metabolites or through the activity of transporters which can prevent the accumulation of harmful toxins [32]. By far the most upregulated detoxification enzyme at all timepoints was the brassinin glucosyltransferase Ssbgt1 (Sscle01g003110; logFC\u2009=\u20097.2\u20138.8). Ssbgt1is expressed in response to the production of a variety of plant phytoalexins in the host, and was shown to specifically degrade the antimicrobial compound brassinin via glucosylation [50]. Ssbgt1 was observed to be the most upregulated detoxification enzyme during the S. sclerotiorum infection of B. napus as well, indicating a strong phytoalexin response in both hosts [24] (Additional file 6: Table S5).Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are known for their ability to detoxify a wide range of toxic compounds through glutathione conjugation [52]. Six GSTs were upregulated in this analysis compared to culture conditions (Sscle01g005000, Sscle08g067590, Sscle06g051110, Sscle10g075830, Sscle15g104750, Sscle06g053300), forming the largest group of detoxification enzymes induced during infection. Compared to other detoxification enzymes, these six GSTs were expressed at relatively consistent levels throughout infection, potentially indicating a constant pressure from plant phytotoxins throughout infection (Table 3).This pattern is largely conserved within the three 2-nitropropane dioxygenase genes (Sscle03g027760, Sscle12g087340, and Sscle11g085500) which constitute the second largest group of detoxification enzymes upregulated in-planta (Table 3).As previously discussed, transporter proteins, especially within the ABC transporter class, can play an important role in the efflux of fungicidal phytotoxins during infection [53, 54]. Of the eight putative ABC transporters up-regulated during infection, three (Sscle01g004040, Sscle02g016430, Sscle14g097690) were among the most up-regulated transporters at any timepoint and all were most induced during early infection (Additional\u00a0file\u00a010: Table S9). The most up-regulated of those three, Sscle01g004040, shares high homology (88%) to Bmr3, a transporter characterized in B. cinerea and found to be strongly induced following exposure to a variety of fungicidal toxins, including mepanipyrim, the grapevine phytoalexin resveratrol, and two dicarboximides [55]. The second, Sscle02g016430, encodes a homolog to Bmr1, another ABC transporter closely related to Bmr3, and was most highly expressed at 48 hpi. The third, Sscle14g097690, is a homolog of the B. cinerea gene BcatrB, known to be important in fungal tolerance to the phytoalexins camalexin and resveratrol [54, 56]. Sscle14g097690 shared the same expression pattern as the other two, demonstrating the greatest upregulation at 48 hpi (Additional\u00a0file\u00a010: Table S9). The upregulation of these various mechanisms of detoxification indicates a strong phytoalexin pressure during S. sclerotiorum infection of soybean, which agrees with previous work highlighting the production of antifungal compounds in soybean during SSR infection [30].Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins containing at-least one DNA-binding domain (DBD) that act as pivotal regulators of gene expression throughout the lifecycle of all Eukaryotes. Because of the potentially positive or inhibitory role that TFs can have on the pathways that they regulate, all DEG\u2019s (logFC >\u20091 or\u2009<\u2009\u2212\u20091) were considered for this analysis, as opposed to only those showing positive regulation. Although many TFs have been annotated, only Ssfkh1 (Sscle06g049780), Ssfoxe2 (Sscle05g046830), and Pac1 (Sscle06g049830) have been functionally characterized in S. sclerotiorum [8, 57, 58]. Of the 197 putative TFs identified in the S. sclerotiorum genome, 68 appear to be differentially regulated during infection (~\u200934.5%) (Additional\u00a0file\u00a011: Table S10). Interestingly, neither Ssfkh1 or Pac1 is differentially expressed, despite their demonstrated role in virulence. Two zinc finger containing TFs very close to one another on chromosome 16 (Sscle16g110450 and Sscle16g110180) and another on chromosome 9 (Sscle09g071930) are the most differentially regulated TFs at 24 HPI, with logFCs of \u2212\u20095.12, \u2212\u20093.43, and\u2009\u2212\u20093.02, respectively (Additional\u00a0file\u00a011: Table S10).Unlike their filamentous cousins, the oomycetes, true fungi lack any conserved domains, such as the RXLR motif, to help in the identification of their effectors [59]. However, other factors were utilized in previous studies to single out putative effector proteins in S. sclerotiorum [22, 60].The previously characterized Ssv263 (Sscle03g028510) [15] has the largest logFC of any putative effector compared to culture conditions (24 hpi\u2009=\u200912.19, 48 hpi\u2009=\u200910.01, and 96 hpi\u2009=\u20096.15) and early v. late infection (log FC\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20095.32), suggesting its likely importance earlier in the infection process. This was also true for a Rhs repeat-containing protein (Ss-rhs1; Sscle06g049430) (71), found to be important for sclerotial development and hyphal infection (Table 4). Ssnep2 (Sscle12g090490), which was characterized as necrosis and ethylene-inducing peptide on Nicotiana benthamiana [16], was up-regulated at all timepoints of the infection (Table 4). Ssssvp1 (Sscle01g003850) and Sscp1 (Sscle16g107670), two fungal proteins shown to induce programmed cell death in plants [18, 64], were highly upregulated at all timepoints in comparison to culture, but showed peak expression at 96 hpi (Table 4). The S. sclerotiorum integrin-like gene (Ssitl; Sscle08g068500), a secreted effector known to suppress jasmonic/ethylene (JA/ET) signaling [17], was only upregulated as compared to culture at 96 hpi (Table 4).Two uncharacterized genes encoding CFEM domain-containing proteins were also identified in this study, the first of which (Sscle07g055350) was among the most upregulated during infection, with logFCs >\u20098 at all timepoints, while the second (Sscle06g050280) showed strong induction at the later stages of infection compared to early (logFC\u2009=\u20095.04).Two genes with no conserved domains and with no known nor characterized homology to other effectors, Sscle05g045060 and Sscle06g048920, were the third and fourth most upregulated at 24 hpi, respectively, and demonstrated consistently high expression throughout infection. Two other highly upregulated genes, Sscle06g055310 and Sscle11g080900, share 99% homology with one another and are closely related to an Immunoglobin E (IgE) binding proteins in Aspergillus fumigatus (~\u200940% identity) (Table 4).To avoid detection and protect their cell walls from enzymatic degradation, many fungal pathogens have evolved strategies to bind their stray chitin to avoid the induction of plant pattern triggered immunity (PTI) and/or plant chitinase activity [65]. Three genes putatively in this category (Sscle08g068200, Sscle07g062010, and Sscle08g066850) contain chitin binding domains and were up-regulated in at-least one timepoint, although whether these genes are acting purely as chitin binding proteins or as chitinases involved in fungal cell wall modification is unknown. Sscle08g068200 and Sscle07g062010 were up-regulated at all timepoints of infection, while Sscle08g066850 was upregulated only at 96 hpi (Table 4).OA is a key virulence factor for S. sclerotiorum that is responsible for the upregulation of ROS within the host, and eventually the induction of programmed cell death (PCD) to the benefit of the pathogen [13, 66]. Thus, redox regulation during pathogenic development is likely to be critical to both the pathogen and the host.The most well studied gene in OA biosynthesis is and oxaloacetate acetylhydrolase (Ssoah1; Sscle10g075560) which catalyzes the conversion of oxaloacetate to OA and carbon dioxide [67]. Previous studies in Phaseolus vulgaris and Brassica napus showed an up-regulation of Ssoah1 during infection [24, 25]. Surprisingly, this pattern was not conserved in the infection of soybean, and Ssoah1 showed no upregulation over the course of infection or when compared to culture (Tables S2 and S5). To confirm that Ssoah1 was being expressed during infection, an analysis of the average expression of each gene was conducted on all timepoints and reported as the average log2 of the read counts per million (Ave. Exp.) (Additional\u00a0file\u00a012: Table S12). This examination revealed that of the 9161 genes with an Ave. Exp. >\u20091, Ssoah1 was the sixth highest (Ave. Exp. = 12.5), and was excluded from the differential expression analysis because it was expressed at similar levels both in vitro and in planta (Additional\u00a0file\u00a013: Table S11). Given that media acidification is commonly used as a measure of OA biosynthesis within S. sclerotiorum, the expression of Ssoah1 in culture is not unexpected [67, 68]. This analysis also highlighted two other genes with high average expression, the peroxiredoxin (Sscle06g048910) and the alcohol oxidase (Sscle03g024060), which were found to be both upregulated in planta and have likely roles in redox regulation (Additional\u00a0file\u00a012: Tables S12 and Additional file 6: Table S5).Previous work in B. napus indicated that expression levels of oxalate decarboxylase (Sscle09g069850), an enzyme known to degrade OA, were up-regulated in concert with Ssoah1, likely due to a careful balance in the regulatory pathways of OA needed for successful infection [24]. A similar pattern was also seen during infection of soybean, given that both genes fell between logFCs of \u2212\u20091 and 1 over the course of infection and failed to qualify as a DEG, indicating constitutive expression.NADPH oxidase (NOX) genes have been reported in a variety of species to be important ROS generators [66, 69, 70]. The two NOX genes identified in S. sclerotiorum, Ssnox1 (Sscle05g048220) and Ssnox2 (Sscle12g087830), were both found to be consistently expressed over the course of infection and Ssnox2 showed very similar expression patterns between infection and culture. Ssnox1, in contrast, showed significantly reduced expression in-planta as compared to culture (logFC\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20092.47) (Additional file 6: Table S5).While the induction of ROS in the plant is often the focus in this pathosystem, the ability of S. sclerotiorum to cope with ROS within the host is likely to be crucial. Along with the previously discussed peroxiredoxin, a Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) gene (Sssod1; Sscle03g025030) was shown to be important for virulence [71]. Sscle03g025030 was upregulated throughout our time course compared to culture (Additional\u00a0file\u00a014: Table S13), confirming its importance during infection. Catalases and peroxidases can also serve as important ROS scavengers [72]. Four catalase enzymes (Sscle03g026200, Sscle04g037170, Sscle05g047950, and Sscle15g104430) were upregulated during infection, all showing highest expression at 96 hpi and no induction at 24 hpi (Additional\u00a0file\u00a014: Table S13), likely to coincide with peak ROS levels at the later stages of infection. The most upregulated catalase was the previously characterized Scat1 (Sscle04g037170), though its role in ROS detoxification is unclear [73]. Of the four peroxidase genes upregulated when compared to culture, two (Sscle03g024750 and Sscle01g000730) show the greatest expression at 24 hpi and two (Sscle07g058850 and Sscle06g053530) show greatest expression at 96 hpi (Additional\u00a0file\u00a014: Table S13). Two additional peroxidases were not upregulated in comparison to culture, but did show either upregulation (Sscle09g070530; logFC\u2009=\u20092.02) or downregulation (Sscle01g007350; logFC\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20091.88) when comparing early and late infection (Additional file 2: Table S2). Overall, detoxification of ROS is clearly a priority throughout the course of infection, but becomes particularly critical during the later stages of when OA induced ROS production induces broad scale programmed cell death in the host.Transcriptomic analyses comparing R and S cultivars during infection with a pathogen have become an increasingly popular method of elucidating the mechanisms of plant resistance [30, 74\ufeff]. The characterization of differentially regulated plant genes, proteins, and pathways can be pivotal in understanding novel mechanisms of resistance, but the effect of plant resistance on pathogen gene expression can be provide insight into fungal mechanisms deployed to counter this resistance as well.DEGs were analyzed between the R and S infections for each timepoint of infection (24, 48, and 96 hpi; p-value <\u20090.01; logFC >\u20091 or\u2009<\u2009\u2212\u20091). 99, 62, and 351 DEGs were generated through the comparison of R and S at 24, 48, and 96 hpi, respectively (Additional\u00a0file\u00a015: Table S14). These genes were classified into broader categories using the functional distribution tool within the FunCat database (FunCatDb) and S. sclerotiorum\u2019s annotated proteins (p3_r20263_Scl_scler) [31] (Additional file 16: Table S15). An interesting observation is that of the DEG\u2019s at 24 hpi, 76.7% (76/99) were up-regulated in R line infection, as opposed to only 23.4% (82/350) which were upregulated at 96 hpi. The fact that the R line largely suppressed SSR infection of its main stem (Fig. 1) suggests that this difference at 96 hpi is likely due to a developmental delay of S. sclerotiorum.Despite the two infections being out-of-sync at 96 hpi, the functional distribution analysis of the DEGs at 24 hpi revealed potentially important strategic differences in gene expression between the two infections. Work to characterize the nature of the 91\u2013145 line resistance noted an increased production of fungicidal organic acids [30], and we concurrently expected that the fungus in the R line would positively regulate genes related to detoxification in order to compensate. Although some regulatory shifts of these genes are observed, a similar number of genes related to detoxification/toxin transport were up- and downregulated in the resistant infection as compared to the susceptible (Fig. 7a). The most marked result of this analysis was the up-regulation of genes related secondary metabolism, particularly melanin. So far, only Scd1 (Sscle03g031470), Thr1 (Sscle03g031480), and Sspks13 (Sscle03g031520) have been characterized as genes pivotal in melanin biosynthesis within S. sclerotiorum [75], although a tetrahydroxynaphthalene reductase (Sscle09g070740) also contains homology to known components of this pathway in other fungi. All four of these genes were upregulated in the R infection at 24 hpi with logFC\u2009=\u2009~\u20092.0\u20132.4. Given that one of the most important protective characteristics of melanin is its role as a hydrophobe within the fungal cell wall, the remaining DEGs at 24 HPI were analyzed to identify any other positively regulated structural or surface proteins serving a similar purpose.Three putatively hydrophobic cell surface proteins were found to have been up-regulated from this list. The first gene, Sscle15g106410, contains a fungal hydrophobin domain (pfam06766) which is a small, moderately hydrophobic extracellular molecule that typically binds to the outside of fungal hyphae to mediate contact and communication between fungi and the environment. The second gene, Sscle12g091650, contains a Hydrophobic surface binding protein A (HsbA) domain (pfam12296) which was identified originally in Aspergillus oryzae as a surface protein important in both the adhesion to and degradation of hydrophobic surfaces [76]. The third gene, Sscle09g070510, contains repeated fasciclin domains (pfam02469) which have been shown in Magnaporthe oryzae to be important in cell adhesion and binding to hydrophobic surfaces [77].Prior work attempting to characterize the mechanism of SSR resistance within the R line indicated that it\u2019s antimicrobial activity likely targeted the biosynthesis/stability of ergosterol, a crucial component of fungal cell walls, through an unknown mechanism [66]. To determine if this activity affected the transcription of genes important in the biosynthesis of ergosterol, or if the fungus within the R line might be overproducing ergosterol in an attempt to offset these effects, several genes known to be important in this pathway were analyzed. Neither Erg28 (Sscle11g086600), sterol 24-C-methyltransferase (Sscle07g056400), nor CYP51 (Sscle02g013950), all of which have been characterized as important components of ergosterol synthesis, were found to be differentially regulated between the two lines at any timepoint [78\u201380].Other genes of interest which were up-regulated in this timepoint comparison include a salicylate hydroxylase (Sscle05g045180) and a well characterized oxalate decarboxylase (Sscle09g069850). Previous studies have demonstrated S. sclerotiorum\u2019s capacity to degrade salicylate in-vitro and Sscle05g045180 was identified as an enzyme potentially responsible for this degradation [81]. Oxalate decarboxylase (Sscle09g069850) is known to degrade OA, a pivotal virulence component during S. sclerotiorum infection. Although this activity appears counterintuitive given OA\u2019s importance in infection, the work characterizing this gene showed its induction was important in the formation of compound appressoria for host penetration [82]. This, along with the upregulation of the previously discussed hydrophobic surface proteins suggests that some expression differences at 24 hpi may be related to differences in S. sclerotiorum\u2019s penetration of the R and S lines.As a broad-host range, predominantly necrotrophic pathogen, S. sclerotiorum has a range of virulence factors, including CWDEs, detoxification enzymes, secreted effectors, and metabolites, that it employs to successfully infect a plethora of hosts [26]. Studies have singled out specific factors in the pathogenic development of S. sclerotiorum, largely in model plants [83]. However, only a few studies have focused on individual S. sclerotiorum-host interactions in crop plants. In this study, we provide a global overview of transcript regulation in S. sclerotiorum in association with soybean, and identify stage-dependent biological processes utilized by this fungus to successfully infect this important crop.The temporal regulation of gene expression in culture, and in the early stages of infection compared to late infection highlighted the potential importance of transporters in the toxin efflux process during fungal infection. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters specifically have been characterized in a variety of fungi, including Magnaporthe oryzae [53] and Botrytis cinerea [54], as important factors in evading early plant defenses and establishing infection. In the case of B. cinerea, the ABC transporter BcAtrB was found to be important in fungal tolerance to the phytoalexin camalexin [54] . S. sclerotiorum\u2019s homolog of this gene (Sscle14g097690) was most induced during early infection. Further studies of this transporter proposed a likely synergistic relationship between BcAtrB and the detoxification enzyme BcLCC2, which required early activity of BcAtrB to reduce the accumulation of antifungal compounds and effectively degrade the target compounds in a BcLCC2 dependent manner [84]. This suggests that in S. sclerotiorum-soybean interactions, ABC transporters potentially involved in toxin efflux are induced primarily early during infection (Additional\u00a0file\u00a010: Table S9), but a broader range of detoxification enzymes show either constitutive or late induction during infection (Table 3). A prime example of this is the GST Ssbgt1 (Sscle01g003110), which has been highlighted for its capacity to detoxify a range of phenolic phytoallexins from multiple plant species and was one of the most upregulated genes throughout infection (Table 3) [50]. We observed the strong induction of two other highly induced ABC transporters homologous to Bmr1 (Sscle02g016430) and Bmr3 (Sscle01g004040) from B. cinerea, which, along with BcAtrB, have all been shown to be induced in the presence of phytoalexins (resveratrol and/or camalexin) [55]. This regulation indicates a potentially strong phytoalexin pressure on S. sclerotiorum during the early stages of infection of soybean.Another group of genes whose induction appears primarily important during early infection are those related to nitrate/nitrite (Sscle02g013580, Sscle01g005230, and Sscle02g016460) metabolism. The relationship of this nitrate assimilation pathway in pathogenicity is still largely unexplored, but the strong induction of these genes may be due to the low nitrogen availability at the early stages of infection.Necrotrophic fungi often rely on their large repertoire of hydrolytic CWDEs and S. sclerotiorum is no exception [23, 85]. Over our time course analysis in soybean, S. sclerotiorum upregulated the expression of 178 putative CWDEs targeting a range of plant substrates (Table 2) and demonstrated distinct expression patterns for many of these enzymes. Comparative analysis across hosts revealed that among the 209 hydrolytic enzymes found to be upregulated during B. napus [24] infection, 55 transcripts, spanning putative arabinogalactan, callose, cellulose, lignin, lipid, mannan, protein, and starch degrading enzymes, were solely upregulated during infection of this host [24] (Additional\u00a0file\u00a017: Table S16). Conversely, 37 putative hydrolytic enzymes covering a similar range of substrates were only up-regulated during infection of soybean (Additional\u00a0file\u00a017: Table S16). This suggests that S. sclerotiorum deploys a specific repertoire of CWDEs depending on the host, highlighting the importance of studying this pathosystem in individual hosts.Notable enzymes specifically deployed against soybean include a cutinase (Sscle02g013440) and polygalacturonase 2 (Sspg2; Sscle03g022740), both of which were highly induced in this study during early and late infection, respectively. Sspg2 expression was only noted during early infection of sunflower [20]. In soybean, however, Sspg2 is highly induced at all time points of infection in soybean and shows the largest differential expression in relation to culture of all PG\u2019s at 96 HPI. The late induction of many cutinase and cutin degrading enzymes seen in this study also contradicts previous assertions that these enzymes are primarily required during the initial penetration of the host [21, 24]. Unlike many of the other CWDEs, all of the 28 identified genes coding for hemicellulose degrading enzymes were upregulated during this interaction (Table 2). Knowledge of this host-specific regulation of CWDEs is critical, both given their role as one of the most important virulence factors in necrotrophic fungal infection and in identifying the value of individual enzymes as targets in the control of SSR.Serine proteases have been characterized as virulence determinants in a large number of phytopathogenic fungi, including Colletotrichum coccodes [86], Fusarium oxysporum [40], Colletotrichum acutatum [41], and Acremonium Strictum [87], and it has been noted that an elevated repertoire of subtilisins appears correlated with a necrotrophic lifestyle [42]. Seventeen serine proteases were identified and found to be upregulated in planta, and interestingly all showed the greatest induction at 24 hpi (Additional file 7: Table S6). Given that proteins involved in plant defense are a likely target of fungal proteolytic enzymes, this early induction may be due to an initial need to subvert the plants immune system which becomes less essential after the infection is established.During infection, B. cinerea produces two major phytotoxic SMs, the sesquiterpene botrydial and the polyketide botcinic acid [88]. Although S. sclerotiorum lacks homologs of the genes to synthesize botrydial, it does possess homologs of the two B. cinerea genes, Bcboa6 (Sscle15g106510) and Bcboa9 (Sscle15g106480), that work in concert to synthesize botcinic acid [88]. Previous studies of S. sclerotiorum phytotoxin production, however, failed to identify botcinic acid [49], and transcriptomic analysis of S. sclerotiorum infection of B. napus only detected upregulation of Sscle15g106510 in planta [24]. Surprisingly, both Sscle15g106510 and Sscle15g106480 were up-regulated during infection of soybeans, with peak expression of both genes at 96 hpi. Bcboa6 and\u00a0\u2212\u20099 belong to a larger SM gene cluster, which is largely conserved within the S. sclerotiorum genome, and appears to be upregulated during infection (Fig. 6). Our results provide the first indication that a phytotoxic analog of botcinic acid may play a role in S. sclerotiorum pathogenesis in soybean. Early characterization of botcinic acid identified the metabolite as a broad spectrum phytotoxin which induced chlorosis and necrosis in plant tissue [89], but the late induction of this SM cluster during soybean infection indicates that this is unlikely to be the primary role of this metabolite. More recent studies have proposed that botcinic acid may have antifungal properties as well [90]. This suggests that the induction of the botcinic acid SM cluster at 96 hpi may serve a dual role in plant colonization, both to induce PCD to kill the host and also to inhibit competitive colonization of the host by other saprophytic fungi.Fifty-seven putative secreted effectors were observed to be upregulated and/or differentially regulated during infection, consisting of a mixture of previously characterized effectors, such as Ssv263 [15], Ssssvp1 [18], Ssnep2 [16], Ss-rhs1 [91], and Ssitl [17], and others which are highly induced, but whose functions are yet to be determined (Sscle07g055350, Sscle06g050280, Sscle05g045060, Sscle06g048920, Sscle06g055310, Sscle11g080900). Although effectors are known to be secreted in \u201cwaves\u201d corresponding to the various stages of infection, many of the most highly upregulated putative effectors were upregulated at all stages of infection in comparison to culture, indicating a more constitutive requirement during S. sclerotiorum infection (Table 4) [61, 62]. Despite this, some trends can still be deduced. All three of the effectors characterized as inducers of PCD (Ssssvp1, Ssnep2, and Sscp1) showed the greatest expression at 96 hpi (Table 4). This regulation is similar to that of the SM gene cluster putatively controlling botcinic acid biosynthesis, indicating that genes responsible for phytotoxicity and PCD induction in the host become increasingly active over the course of colonization. Alternatively, other putative effectors whose roles are more likely related to avoiding detection by the plant, such as the putative chitin binding Sscle08g068200 and Sscle07g062010, or undermining plant innate immunity, such as the chorismate mutase Sscle16g111080 [92], are more highly expressed during early infection (24\u201348 hpi) (Table 4). The recent discovery that the pathogen goes through a short biotrophic phase during early infiltration [93] supports a model whereby it prioritizes the subversion/avoidance of plant resistance mechanisms early in infection and increases phytotoxic activity as the infection progresses, similar to prototypical hemibiotrophs [61]. This data also suggests that other, poorly characterized effectors with similar patterns of high expression in either early (Ssv263 [15], acp1 [39], Sscle15g106630, etc.) or late (Sscle07g055350, Sscle05g041050, Sscle04g040080, etc.) infection may be involved in these same processes.Oxalic acid (OA) is a key virulence factor in the pathogenic development of S. sclerotiorum [8, 10, 12]. It is known to upregulate ROS within the host, leading to the cell suicide and the establishment of disease [13, 14, 66]. Thus, redox regulation and OA biogenesis are important factors to consider when studying a particular S. sclerotiorum-host interaction. Surprisingly the oxaloacetate acetylhydrolase gene (Ssoah1) primarily responsible for OA biogenesis was neither upregulated in comparison to culture nor between early and late infection. A previous study which noted a similar phenomenon posited that an alternate route of OA biosynthesis may be utilized during early infection [19], but high expression of Ssoah1 throughout infection and in culture indicates that the gene likely has an important role across all environments, thus precluding it from a differential expression analysis.The upregulation of ROS by OA serves an important role in killing the host, but as ROS is broadly toxic to all life, S. sclerotiorum contains a number of ROS scavenging enzymes to maintain its own redox homeostasis during infection. In this study, four catalases (Scat1; Sscle04g037170, Sscle03g026200, Sscle05g047950, and Sscle15g104430), four peroxidases (Sscle03g024750, Sscle01g000730, Sscle07g058850, and Sscle06g053530), a superoxide dismutase (Sssod1; Sscle03g025030), and a peroxiredoxin (Sscle06g048910) were found to be upregulated in comparison to culture (Additional\u00a0file\u00a014: Table S13). These ROS scavenging enzymes showed unique temporal regulation over the course of infection, with the peroxiredoxin and two of the peroxidases (Sscle03g024750 and Sscle01g000730) being most upregulated at 24 hpi but all four of the catalases and the remaining two peroxidases demonstrating greatest expression at 96 hpi (Additional\u00a0file\u00a014: Table S13). Increased ROS scavenging activity during later infection corresponds with the likely accumulation of ROS required for the widespread cell death seen at 96 hpi. Early ROS scavenging activity may play a role in dampening the oxidative stress to the fungus as well, but the possible roles in fungal development cannot be overlooked as it\u2019s well established that ROS plays a pivotal role in intracellular signaling and cell\u2013cell interactions [94].Finally, an examination of S. sclerotiorum\u2019s transcriptome during infection of a resistant soybean line elucidated the reaction of the pathogen to a successful defense response by its host. During the resistant line infection, we detected increased expression of several secondary metabolism genes related to melanin biosynthesis as well as three putatively hydrophobic cell surface proteins (i.e. hydrophobins). While melanin biosynthesis is known to be induced by fungus in the presence of oxidative and/or osmotic stress [100], hydrophobins are often associated with fungal adhesion, infiltration, and suppression of host immune responses [102\u2013105]. Previous studies on the hydrophobin-like gene, TasHyd1, from Trichoderma asperellum showed it to be vital in maintaining proper fungal wettability and in the adhesion of the fungus to the hosts roots [95]. Another function of hydrophobin-like genes was demonstrated in the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus, where it was shown that the protein served to mask the pathogen from recognition and the subsequent induction of innate immunity [96]. This function is of particular interest given that the same study demonstrated that melanin was an inducer of this immune response, providing a framework by which S. sclerotiorum may upregulate hydrophobins in concert with melanin to avoid triggering plant defenses. Although we cannot currently state whether the upregulation of these hydrophobic cell surface proteins is in response to chemical stress from the plant, increased difficulty in initial penetration, or an attempt to shield the pathogen from detection, it is clear that the fungus shows a distinct transcriptomic response to the resistant line at 24 hpi despite a lack of phenotypic differentiation until post-48 hpi. The regulation of these hydrophobins and the increase in melanin biosynthesis may play a pivotal role in either fungal penetration or the early suppression of innate immunity, which would be an important requirement of S. sclerotiorum during its early biotrophic phase of infection [93].Given the broad host range of S. sclerotiorum and the repertoire of virulence factors contained within its genome, transcriptomic analysis of individual S. sclerotiorum-host interactions is critical to future disease control efforts. In this study, gene expression of S. sclerotiorum was measured over the course of a compatible soybean infection. During early infection the pathogen prioritizes penetration and establishment by upregulating transporters involved in toxin efflux, nitrogen metabolism, and a variety of putative secreted effectors with likely roles in the suppression of plant immunity. As infection progresses the pathogen expresses a host-specific range of CWDEs and detoxification enzymes to release sugars from the plant cell walls and degrade antimicrobial compounds being produced as a response to colonization. By the later stages of infection, disease is well established and S. sclerotiorum appears to prioritize the transport of newly available carbohydrates, the induction of PCD in the host, and the formation of sclerotia as overwintering structures.To study the response of S. sclerotiorum to a resistant (non-compatible) host, gene expression was compared to a susceptible interaction during early infection. Clear regulatory differences were identified in the production of melanin and hydrophobic surface proteins in the resistant interaction potentially indicating an attempt by the pathogen to either evade detection and/or defend against antifungal compounds. Knowledge of the mechanisms utilized by S. sclerotiorum to overcome either typical or novel mechanisms of plant resistance is invaluable in the pursuit of stable durable resistance to SSR and will be the focus of further research.For both the plant inoculations and culture controls, a wild type isolate of S. sclerotiorum strain 1980 was grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) [10]. Strain 1980 was utilized as it is both a common laboratory strain of S. sclerotiorum and the genome sequenced strain used for downstream bioinformatic analysis in this study. Plant inoculations utilized agar plugs directly from this PDA culture, but culture controls were further cleaned and grown in glucose minimal (GMM) media prior to extraction. Fresh mycelia from PDA plates were scraped and then filtered through Miracloth (Darmstadt, Germany). Collected mycelia were washed (40\u2009\u00b0C, 4000\u2009rpm, 10\u2009min) twice with sterile autoclaved water and used to inoculate 100\u2009ml of GMM [97]. The GMM cultures were grown on a shaker for 48\u2009h (150\u2009rpm, 25\u2009\u00b0C). Mycelia was collected by filtering through Miracloth (Darmstadt, Germany) and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to RNA extraction.Two recombinants inbred lines of soybean (Glycine max), 91\u2013145 and 91\u201344, were used in this study. Both lines were previously developed and evaluated as germplasm stock to increase quantitative resistance to SSR in soybean breeding programs, but are not commercially available [27]. Lines can be made available upon request to the corresponding author. Both the resistant 91\u2013145 (R) and the susceptible 91\u201344 (S) lines were developed utilizing W04\u20131002 (P1), a SSR resistant parental line, and LN89\u20135717 (PI 5745542), a SSR-susceptible parental line demonstrating other desirable pathogen resistance traits [27]. Plants were supplemented with fertilizer (Miracle-Gro) every two weeks and maintained in the greenhouse or growth chamber at 24\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u2009\u00b0C with 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod cycle.Four week old soybean plants were infected with S. sclerotiorum by petiole inoculation as previously described [66], using a 1\u2009ml pipette tip agar plug of actively growing fungal hyphae. Plant tissue was sampled by cutting horizontally above and below (1.5\u2009cm) the node of the inoculated petiole with a clean straight-edge razor. Tissue samples were then immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to RNA extraction. The experimental design was completely randomized and consisted of three biological replicates for each of the treatments. For each of the experimental conditions, stem segments (\u223c3\u2009cm, first internode) from 2 different plants were pooled together to form one of three biological replicates.Total RNA was extracted from soybean stem tissues and infecting S. sclerotiorum using a modified TRIzol\u2122 Reagent protocol (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA). Further, samples were cleaned using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA concentration and purity was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE) and sample quality was assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 and an RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Three biological replicates were generated per treatment.Library preparation was performed at the University of Wisconsin \u2013 Madison Biotechnology Centre (Madison, WI, USA). Individually indexed libraries were prepared using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation v2 kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Illumina, San Diego CA, USA). Library concentrations were quantified with the Qubit HS DNA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE). The size and quality of the libraries were evaluated with an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 and an Agilent DNA 1000 kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and the libraries were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq2500 (1X100bp) (Illumina, San Diego CA, USA).Illumina raw read data quality was verified with FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). The soybean and S. sclerotiorum genomes were collected from Phytozome v12.1 (https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html#!bulk?org=Org_Gmax) and the Broad institute (https://www.broadinstitute.org/fungal-genome-initiative/sclerotinia-sclerotiorum-genome-project), respectively [23, 98]. Raw sequence reads were mapped to both genomes using the Subjunc aligner from Subread [99]. Alignments were compared to the gene annotation GFF files for both organisms (Soybean: Gmax_275_Wm82.a2.v1.gene.gff3 [98], S. sclerotiorum: sclerotinia_sclerotiorum_2_transcripts.gtf [23]) and raw counts for each gene were generated using the feature Counts tool from Subread. The raw counts data were normalized with the trimmed mean of means (TMM) normalization method using edgeR package [100]. The normalized gene counts were transformed to log2 scale using the voom method from the R Limma package, then used to generate differential expression (log2FC) values [101, 102]. DEGs (log2FC\u2009>\u20091 or\u2009<\u2009\u2212\u20091) were generated for S. sclerotiorum genes from the comparison of inoculated soybeans at different timepoints to the culture control (FDR\u2009<\u20090.05), between early (24 and 48 hpi) and late (96 hpi) infection (FDR\u2009<\u20090.05), and between the timepoints of resistant (R) and susceptible (S) line infections (p-value <\u20090.01). The different statistical threshold applied in the R vs S comparison (p-value <\u20090.01) was utilized to account for a higher standard deviation in the R line replicates which precluded the usage of the more conservative FDR\u2009<\u20090.05. To reduce the likelihood of false positives from low transcript genes, samples were filtered to remove DEGs in which all timepoints had average RPKM values <\u20091. To utilize the most recent nomenclature in describing S. sclerotiorum genes, all gene loci were updated to the annotations assigned in the most recent full genome sequence of S. sclerotiorum [60] (Additional\u00a0file\u00a018: Table S17). Genes which were removed or combined in the most recent resequencing were removed from the analysis.Putative annotations were assigned to all genes using the Blast2Go software [103]. Select genes were also analyzed for conserved domains, characterized homologues, and closely related pathogenic fungi using BlastP [104]. Functional categorization of DEGs was done using the FunCat database (FunCatDb) and S. sclerotiorum\u2019s annotated proteins (p3_r20263_Scl_scler). Functional distribution characterization was generated using the FunCat functional distribution tool, which applied a site-specific hypergeometric distribution to identify overrepresented functional categories (Bonferroni correction <\u20090.05) [31].Stems were harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was isolated using the above-mentioned protocol and then treated with RNase-free DNaseI (NEB Inc., Ipswich, MA, USA). The RNA was reverse transcribed using the AMV First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (NEB Inc., Ipswitch, MA) and oligo-dT primer according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RT-qPCR was performed using a SensiFAST SYBR No ROX Kit (Bioline USA Inc., Taunton, MA, USA). Each reaction consisted of 5\u2009\u03bcL of SensiFAST SYBR No-ROX Mix, 1\u2009\u03bcL of 1:10-fold diluted template cDNAs, and 0.4\u2009\u03bcL of 10\u2009\u03bcM gene-specific forward and reverse primers in a final volume of 10\u2009\u03bcL. Primers were either culled from the literature or designed using Primer3 software [105, 106] for the amplification of gene fragments that were approximately 100\u2013250\u2009bp in length and with an annealing temperature of 60\u2009\u00b0C (Additional file 1: Table S1). The primer specificity was checked in silico against the NCBI database through the Primer-BLAST tool (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). RT-qPCR was performed on a CFX96 real-time PCR system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The run conditions were: 2\u2009min of initial denaturation at 95\u2009\u00b0C; 95\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009s, 58\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009s, and 72\u2009\u00b0C for 20\u2009s (40\u2009cycles). The relative expression of genes was calculated using the 2-\u0394\u0394Ct method [107] with the fungal \u03b2-tubulin gene (Sscle02g015170) used as an endogenous control.

The resistant 91\u2013145 (R) and the susceptible 91\u201344 (S) were the result of crossing between W04\u20131002 (P1), a SSR resistant parental line, and LN89\u20135717 (PI 5745542), a parental line susceptible to SSR but demonstrating other desirable traits [27]. Plants were inoculated using the cut petiole method and infection progression was monitored for seven days. SSR symptoms, observed as typical brown lesions surrounding the point of infection, began to appear 48\u2009h post-inoculation (hpi). At 96 hpi lesions were visible on the main stem of the S line, while disease progress had slowed substantially and restricted lesions with a red coloration were observed on the node of the R line (Fig.\u00a01). By day 7 the susceptible soybeans showed extensive lesions along the main stem and began to wilt, whereas the resistant line had largely resisted fungal colonization into the main stem, accompanied by a more prominent red coloration at the infected node of the main stem. The red stem phenotype developed in 90% of the R plants tested (9 out of 10), while none of the S plants showed this phenotype. The red stem appears to be indicative of a specific resistance response by the R line to inhibit S. sclerotiorum pathogenesis and is correlated with the production of antimicrobial compounds affecting fungal growth [30].\n\nFig. 1\nDisease symptoms observed following petiole inoculation with an agar plug containing actively growing mycelia of S. sclerotiorum at 24, 48, 96\u2009h post-inoculation (hpi) and 7\u2009days post inoculation (dpi). a Susceptible (S) line. b Resistant (R) line. At 7 dpi in the R line, red coloration at point of inoculation (red node) is prominently visible. The red stem phenotype developed in 90% of the R plants tested (9 out of 10), while none of the S plants showed this phenotype\nOf the reads sequenced from the S line, approximately 4.4, 4.0, and 27% mapped to the S. sclerotiorum genome at 24, 48 and 96 hpi, respectively. In the R line, approximately 3.5, 3.8, and 7.8% of the reads mapped to the S. sclerotiorum genome at 24, 48 and 96 hpi, respectively (Table\u00a01). At 96 hpi the percentage of reads mapping to the fungal genome in the S line (27%) was significantly higher than those in the R line (8%), in accordance with the extent of tissue colonization on the stems of both lines following S. sclerotiorum challenge.Table 1\nSummary of the sequencing metrics of the RNA-seq\nTo validate the accuracy of the RNA-Seq data, five previously characterized and three uncharacterized genes showing distinct expression patterns during infection of the S line were quantified using a SYBR Green based RT-qPCR. Primers were either designed or culled from the literature (Additional file 1: Table S1). The five previously characterized genes were Sspg5 (Sscle02g018820), Ssv263 (Sscle03g028510), Ssp1 (Sscle10g079320), Sscvnh (Sscle04g038020), and Ssitl (Sscle08g068500). The three uncharacterized genes were a putative cytochrome p450 monooxygenase (Sscle15g106500), a putative laccase (Sscle03g023030), and a putative serine protease (Sscle05g041810). The expression patterns for each gene, as compared to culture, were similar between RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR, with Ssitl and Sscle05g041810 showing the greatest variance, but with similar trends between the two methods (Fig.\u00a02). The expression level of Ssoah1 (Sscle10g075560), which was not differentially regulated at any timepoint of infection, was also consistent between the two methods (data not shown). Thus, these results indicate a close correlation between our RT-qPCR and RNAseq data.\n\nFig. 2\nReal-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) validation of RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) data in the S line infection. Log2 Fold Change (LogFC) values were generated for RT-qPCR samples by comparing the expression of genes at each timepoint of infection vs. the culture control using the 2\u2009\u2212\u2009\u0394\u0394Ct method. LogFC values were generated for RNA-Seq samples by comparing the average RPKM values of genes at each timepoint of infection vs. the culture control. Data are presented as means \u00b1 standard error (SE) from three independent replicates\nTo examine changes in S. sclerotiorum\u2019s transcriptome during pathogenic development in soybean, a differential expression analysis was performed between early and late infection in the S line. For the purpose of this analysis, \u201cearly infection\u201d was defined as the average expression between 24 and 48 hpi, and \u201clate infection\u201d was defined as 96 hpi. These assignments were made because of the phenotypic differences between these timepoints (i.e. 24 and 48 hpi\u2009=\u2009restricted to inoculated petiole, 96 hpi\u2009=\u2009colonization of the main stem), but also due to a clear regulatory shift in gene expression between these stages of infection (Fig.\u00a03). Differentially expressed genes (DEG\u2019s) (False discovery rate (FDR)\u2009<\u20090.05; Average Reads Per Kilobase of transcript, per Million mapped reads (RPKM)\u2009>\u20091; and log2 fold change (logFC)\u2009\u2265\u20091 or\u2009\u2264\u2009\u2212\u20091) were generated and categorized using BlastGo annotation and their predicted role in the infection cycle.\n\nFig. 3\nSummary heat map showing all differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the comparison of the 96 hpi timepoint to the average of the 24 and 48 hpi timepoints. Columns represent replicates of each timepoint and rows represent individual genes. The tree above the heatmap demonstrates the hierarchical clustering of the samples. Red is used to represent genes which were up-regulated, and blue is used to represent genes which were down-regulated\nSix hundred fifty-five DEGs were identified over the course of the S line infection, with 76.1% (431/566) showing up-regulation late in infection (LATE) and 23.9% (135/566) showing the reverse trend with higher expression early in infection (EARLY) (Additional file 2: Table S2). A functional distribution characterization of both LATE and EARLY genes was performed using the functional distribution tool within the FunCat database (FunCatDb) and S. sclerotiorum\u2019s annotated proteins (p3_r20263_Scl_scler) [31]. When functional categories were filtered to reflect only groups that were significantly enriched (Bonferroni correction <\u20090.05), a wide deviation was apparent. Of the significantly enriched LATE gene categories, most were related to metabolism (27.8%), degradation (16.7%), or catabolism (11.1%), all processes important in necrotrophic pathogens for colonization, degradation, and detoxification during infection. Similarly, several gene categories related to virulence and disease (16.7%) were upregulated late in infection (Fig.\u00a04a; Additional file 3: Table S3A). Unlike the LATE genes, a majority of the categories applied to EARLY genes (66.7%) and majority of the total EARLY genes categorized (51.6%) were related to transport. (Fig. 4b; Additional file 3: Table S3B). While it\u2019s difficult to infer the exact function of these transporters during soybean infection, it\u2019s well established that fungi utilize an array of membrane bound transporters to facilitate the efflux of fungicidal toxins [32]. We also observed differences in the specific categories of transporters that were differentially expressed (Additional file 4: Figure S1; Additional file 2: Table S2). Although major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters involved in sugar transport (87.5%) were upregulated largely late in infection, MFS transporters involved in drug resistance and efflux (61.5%) and ABC Transporters (66.6%) were more highly expressed during early stages of infection. This suggests that S. sclerotiorum may prioritize the expulsion of antifungal toxins early in infection, but shifts focus to the transport of carbohydrates at a later stage when sugars have been released from the hosts cell walls.\n\nFig. 4\nA functional distribution characterization of genes differentially expressed over the course of infection in the S line. a the characterized functional distribution of genes up-regulated during infection (Bonferroni correction <\u20090.05), b the characterized functional distribution of genes down-regulated during infection (Bonferroni correction <\u20090.05)\nTo identify important pathogenicity components in S. sclerotiorum, a comparative expression analysis was performed between each timepoint of the S line infection (24, 48, and 96 hpi) and the culture control (C). DEG\u2019s (False discovery rate (FDR)\u2009<\u20090.05; Average RPKM >\u20091; and log2 fold change (logFC)\u2009\u2265\u20091 or\u2009\u2264\u2009\u2212\u20091) were generated and categorized using BlastGo annotation and their predicted role in the infection cycle. To focus on genes specifically induced during soybean infection, only genes with at least one time-point containing a logFC greater than one were considered. Over all three timepoints of infection, a total of 2093 putative genes showed positive regulation in-planta (Additional file 6: Table S5). Of these genes, 262, 120, and 505 were up-regulated exclusively at 24, 48, and 96 HPI, respectively, and 728 were up-regulated at all timepoints (Fig.\u00a05).\n\nFig. 5\nVenn diagram of genes up-regulated at each timepoint of infection (24, 48, and 96 hpi) when compared to the culture control (C)\nThe successful degradation of plant cell walls is a pivotal step in both the colonization of host plants and in the release of sugars to be metabolized by fungal pathogens. S. sclerotiorum\u2019s genome contains numerous genes that code for CWDEs [23], though, only a portion of this repertoire appears to be positively regulated during infection of soybean (Table\u00a02).Table 2\nHydrolytic enzymes up-regulated in-planta\n\nThe hydrolytic enzymes up-regulated at some time point of infection. Enzymes were putatively assigned to specific substrates based on Blast2GO annotation or characterized homologues\nBotcinic acid is an important virulence factor of B. cinerea, and despite finding the orthologous SM cluster in S. sclerotiorum, previous studies have failed to identify the toxin in S. sclerotiorum [49] or the upregulation of the pivotal PKS genes in-planta [24]. However, we found all 13 orthologs of the botcinic acid gene cluster (Bcboa1\u201313) to be upregulate in this study, with all showing the highest upregulation at 96 hpi (Fig.\u00a06). Nearly all of the most upregulated SM synthesis genes and CYP450s belong to this cluster, including the two PKS genes directly implicated in botcinic acid biosynthesis (Sscle15g106510 and Sscle15g106480), an additional PKS (Sscle15g106520), a putative FAD-dependent monooxygenase (Sscle15g106490), and three CYP450\u2019s (Sscle15g106540, Sscle15g106530, and Sscle15g106500).\n\nFig. 6\nSecondary metabolite cluster identified on chromosome 15 of S. sclerotiorum. The cluster contains three putative Cytochrome P450s (Sscle15g106540, \u2212\u200930, \u2212\u200900), three putative PKSs (Sscle15g106520, \u2212\u200910, \u2212\u2009480), two putative acetyltransferases (Sscle15g106460 and\u2009\u2212\u200950), a putative FAD-dependent monooxygenase (Sscle15g106490), a putative alpha/beta hydrolase (Sscle15g106470), and a predicted protein of unknown function (Sscle15g106440). The gene loci, logFCs (compared to culture), predicted function, and homologue in B. cinerea of each gene are shown. Sscle05g042560 and Sscle05g042570 appear within this gene cluster in B. cinerea, but are found on chromosome 5 of S. sclerotiorum\n\n\nFig. 7\nFunctional distribution of differentially expressed in the R and S lines at 24 (a)\u00a0and 96 hpi\u00a0(b).

A recent analysis of the S. sclerotiorum-soybean pathosystem identified phenolic compounds generated in the phenylpropanoid pathway as a pivotal component of soybean resistance, thus highlighting a potentially critical role for laccases in suppressing this immune response [30]. Only two laccases, a putative laccase 2 (Sscle03g023030) and a probable laccase precursor (Sscle13g092370), were upregulated in comparison to culture, the latter of which was only upregulated at 48 hpi. The former laccase gene, Sscle03g023030, is notable both because of its impressive upregulation in-planta and because it was not documented in the transcriptomic analysis of B. napus [24] or P. vulgaris [25]. As well as being up-regulated at all timepoints, Sscle03g023030 is among the most differentially expressed between early and late infection, with its greatest upregulation at 24 hpi (logFC\u2009=\u20097.8) and lowest at 96 hpi (logFC\u2009=\u20092.8) (Table 3).Table 3\nDetoxification enzymes up-regulated in-planta\n\nalog2 Fold Change\nThe logFC and Blast2GO description of genes putatively assigned as detoxification enzymes within S. sclerotiorum.

Of these 57 genes, only 18 were differentially regulated during the course of infection (early v. late) (Table 4). The large number of putative effectors that are not differentially expressed over the course of infection could point to a more constitutive expression of effectors in S. sclerotiorum than is commonly seen in biotrophic and hemibiotrophic fungi, which often alter effector expression as they transition between stages of infection (i.e. appressoria formation, penetration of invasive hyphae, differentiation into necrotrophic hyphae) [61\u201363].Table 4\nPutative secreted effectors up-regulated during infection\n\nAll putative secreted effectors identified as either up-regulated in-planta or differentially regulated over the course of infection.

(XLSX 212 kb)", "s12864-019-5532-5": "Understanding how transcription occurs requires the integration of genome-wide and locus-specific information gleaned from robust technologies. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a staple in gene expression studies, and while genome-wide methods are available, high-throughput approaches to analyze defined regions are lacking.Here, we present carbon copy-ChIP (2C-ChIP), a versatile, inexpensive, and high-throughput technique to quantitatively measure the abundance of DNA sequences in ChIP samples. This method combines ChIP with ligation-mediated amplification (LMA) and deep sequencing to probe large genomic regions of interest. 2C-ChIP recapitulates results from benchmark ChIP approaches. We applied 2C-ChIP to the HOXA cluster to find that a region where H3K27me3 and SUZ12 linger encodes HOXA-AS2, a long non-coding RNA that enhances gene expression during cellular differentiation.2C-ChIP fills the need for a robust molecular biology tool designed to probe dedicated genomic regions in a high-throughput setting. The flexible nature of the 2C-ChIP approach allows rapid changes in experimental design at relatively low cost, making it a highly efficient method for chromatin analysis.Since it was pioneered, the ChIP protocol [1\u20133] has been adapted to improve speed, work on a smaller cell number, and/or increase its specificity [4]. Detection of ChIP signal has similarly been subject to many changes from its original DNA hybridization readout. Whereas quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-qPCR) with specific primers remains the method of choice when analyzing few pre-determined candidate target sequences, ChIP followed by deep sequencing with next-generation technologies (ChIP-seq) is most commonly used for genome-wide profiling [5].ChIP-seq is a powerful approach that identifies binding sites across an entire genome to provide complete views of protein and/or modification landscapes. However, understanding transcription will not only require genome-wide information but also its integration with data collected from the comprehensive analysis of defined genomic domains. In fact, ChIP-seq is not always the appropriate method of analysis, particularly when studying defined genomic regions. Indeed, interest is often directed towards given genomic region(s), and as the scope of analysis is increasingly broadening to include either numerous time points or different forms of perturbation (e.g., RNA interference knockdown, CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, drug treatment), the high cost of ChIP-seq can limit the number of cell samples to be profiled, how many proteins or modifications can be analyzed, and/or the depth at which profiles are generated in multiplexed samples. In such comprehensive studies, measuring individual DNA regions by ChIP-qPCR is also inappropriate even for relatively short regions as it would be far too labor-intensive. ChIP-qPCR also uses a considerable amount of ChIP material to measure individual DNA sequences, which severely limits what can be quantified in an experiment. Thus, there is a need for a new form of high-throughput ChIP analysis method.Here we present a ChIP-based methodology for profiling large pre-defined genomic regions. We refer to this method as carbon copy-ChIP or \u20182C-ChIP\u2019. This approach, outlined in Fig. 1, is inspired by the chromosome conformation capture carbon copy technique (5C; [6]). 2C-ChIP combines conventional ChIP with highly multiplexed ligation-mediated amplification (LMA) to selectively copy and amplify ChIP signal from desired genomic regions (Fig. 1b). The resulting 2C-ChIP libraries are then analyzed by quantitative, high-throughput DNA sequencing. Given the rather low complexity of 2C-ChIP libraries, products can be barcoded and further multiplexed before sequencing on next-generation instruments to provide very high depth and coverage of many different ChIP profiles in single 2C-ChIP samples.We developed and validated the 2C-ChIP protocol by analyzing the HOXA gene cluster during retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation of human pluripotent NT2-D1 cells into neuroectodermal lineages as we have done previously [7]. Through this analysis, we recapitulated our previous data and identified a domain that is slow to lose its H3K27me3 signal, forms a subTAD when viewed by 5C-seq [8], and contains the HOXA-AS2 long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) gene. HOXA-AS2 is the second lncRNA gene activated during RA-induced differentiation. Interestingly, within this domain is a small region overlapping the HOXA-AS2 gene that was previously shown to repress transcription ectopically and act as a polycomb repressive element (PRE) in drosophila [9]. We found that preventing the accumulation of HOXA-AS2 during RA induction drastically reduces the expression of all the proximal HOXA genes. Lower H3K4me3 levels at all promoters accompanied these changes without affecting H3K27me3 level changes in the gene bodies. Importantly, 5C-seq revealed that curbing HOXA-AS2 accumulation via RNA interference led to greater contact frequencies within its own subTAD, and to lesser long-range interactions in the proximal region. Thus, these structural changes might contribute to lower HOXA expression levels by distancing enhancers and genes. Based on this 2C-ChIP analysis and its integration with chromatin conformation data, we suggest that HOXA-AS2 contributes to the collinear HOXA activation by maintaining gene expression during the later stages of induction in part by controlling the cluster\u2019s spatial organization.The ChIP protocol, which is previously described in ([10]; http://younglab.wi.mit.edu/hESRegulation/Young_Protocol.doc), is outlined in Fig. 1a (top). A ChIP experiment typically yields a complex array of DNA sequences that are selectively immunoprecipitated from entire genomes in a population of cells (\u2018purified ChIPed gDNA\u2019). The abundance of each sequence reflects the frequency at which the protein or modification is found at that position in the cell population. During analysis, sequence abundance is most commonly measured using a candidate approach with specific primers, or genome-wide by quantitative sequencing. In either case, a sample of the chromatin used for ChIP is included as control (\u2018purified input gDNA\u2019).The 2C-ChIP method fills the need for a versatile, low-cost, and high-throughput approach to quantify ChIP signals at defined genomic regions. 2C-ChIP detects immunoprecipitated DNA sequences by multiplex ligation-mediated amplification (LMA; Fig. 1b). During LMA, primer pairs are annealed next to each other on the same DNA strand, and only contiguously annealed primers can be ligated to quantitatively detect target sequences. The 2C-ChIP primers feature universal tails such that products from individual libraries can be PCR-amplified in a single step. The amplification primers also contain barcode sequences, which allows multiplexing of the 2C-ChIP libraries themselves prior to sequencing. As with any other LMA-based approach ([6] and references therein), 2C-ChIP can be conducted with thousands of primers in single reactions to detect target sequences at genome-scale without compromising linearity.To analyze target regions by 2C-ChIP, a mixture of adjacent forward and reverse primer pairs is first annealed to ChIPed material. As usual in LMA, only reverse primers are 5\u2032 end-phosphorylated to enable ligation. The primer pairs are designed to tile the region(s) of interest at a density selected to achieve the coverage and resolution desired. The annealed primer pairs are next ligated with Taq DNA ligase, which selectively ligates hybridized oligos only when positioned next to each other without overlap or gap between them. This step effectively produces a quantitative imprint or \u201ccarbon copy\u201d of the probed sequences in immunoprecipitated samples. The resulting 2C-ChIP libraries are then PCR-amplified with sequencing primers of the platform of choice, featuring barcodes that are designed against the universal tails of the 2C-ChIP primers (Fig. 1b).During development, HOX genes are master regulators of anterior-posterior (A-P) body patterning, and are involved in organogenesis and the formation of limbs [13\u201316]. During body plan formation, HOX spatial and temporal expression is observed to follow the order of their positions along their respective chromosomes, with those at the cluster 3\u2032 end expressed more anteriorly and earlier than those at the 5\u2032 end. Similarly, during limb formation, 3\u2032 end genes are expressed earlier and in the proximal limb region compared to those within the cluster\u2019s 5\u2032 end, which are turned on later and more distally in the limb. This spatio-temporal collinearity appears to emerge from many different types of control mechanisms, including the modulations of chromatin landscape and of three-dimensional chromatin organization. These underlying mechanisms have been scrutinized for over three decades and still remain under intense investigation.An interesting feature of the human HOXA gene cluster is that it resides in a bivalent domain when transcriptionally silent [17]. The HOXA cluster contains 9 developmentally regulated protein-coding genes encoded on the same DNA strand and 4 intergenic lncRNAs transcribed from the opposite strand (Fig. 2a). Bivalent chromatin regions are DNA segments featuring both activating (H3K4me3) and repressing (H3K27me3) epigenetic marks. HOX, like many other genes that regulate cellular differentiation, are thought to exist in this state to keep them inactive but poised for rapid activation [18]. Whether transcription of a gene will be turned on appears to depend on the removal of polycomb group proteins (PcG) and their modifications [19]. Bivalent domains are also often regulated by lncRNAs that recruit enzyme complexes responsible for activating or repressing histone marks [7, 20, 21].Interestingly, at least one of these lncRNAs can regulate three-dimensional chromatin organization as a mechanism to control the expression of genes. We recently demonstrated that HOTAIRM1 is required for proper collinear activation of the proximal HOXA genes by RA [7]. HOTAIRM1 is a lncRNA encoded between HOXA1 and 2 that is rapidly induced upon cell differentiation by RA in NT2-D1 cells. It binds chromatin-modifying complexes, and prevents premature expression of HOXA genes during the early stages of induction. Indeed, preventing HOTAIRM1 accumulation by RNAi results in failure to physically uncouple the HOXA1/2 and HOXA5/6/7 subTADs, leading to the premature expression of the latter genes. Thus, analyzing HOXA induction by RA in NT2-D1 cells, which recapitulate the cluster\u2019s temporal collinearity observed in development [22, 23], allows for the integration of 2C-ChIP results with that of three-dimensional chromatin organization, lncRNA activity, and gene expression.The NT2-D1 cell model (Fig. 2b) is used extensively to study HOX gene regulation as it recapitulates their induction pattern in developing axial systems upon RA treatment [24\u201327]. Others and we have previously characterized the various changes in chromatin landscape accompanying this process [7, 26, 28, 29]. To develop 2C-ChIP with this differentiation system, we first measured gene expression in sample sets using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) (Fig. 2c, d; Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S1) with previously validated primers ([7, 27, 30]; Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Table S2). As expected [7], HOXA gene levels are nominal prior to induction and the expression of proximal genes is greatly increased upon RA treatment (Fig. 2c). LncRNA levels behave similarly, with HOTAIRM1 as the most induced transcript after the 3-day treatment (Fig. 2d). Using fixed chromatin, we then measured the levels of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 by ChIP-qPCR at the promoter and within the body of strategically selected genes to assess the extent of epigenetic changes in matched sample sets (Additional\u00a0file\u00a03: Table S3). As expected [7], we find that H3K4me3 is present preferentially at the promoter of proximal genes before and after induction, and that it increases slightly following RA treatment (Fig. 2e, top). In contrast, H3K27me3 is found both at promoters and within gene bodies, and sharply decreases specifically at the proximal genes after RA induction (Fig.\u00a02e, bottom).Having verified that sample sets display the expected epigenetic changes upon treatment with the morphogen, we then used these fixed chromatin preparations to measure changes in H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 levels by 2C-ChIP (Fig. 2f). We designed 160 primer pairs covering the HOXA cluster at high density, as well as surrounding upstream and downstream regions at lower density to serve as negative controls (Additional\u00a0file\u00a04: Table S4; Additional\u00a0file\u00a05: Table S5). As would be expected from the ChIP-qPCR results, we observed higher levels of activating H3K4me3 at the promoter of proximal genes, accompanied with lower levels of H3K27me3 after 3\u2009days of RA induction (Fig. 2f; Additional\u00a0file\u00a06: BED file\u00a01\u20134). To compare the ChIP-qPCR and 2C-ChIP data, we calculated the average score of all 2C-ChIP probes located within a 1-kb window centered at the corresponding ChIP-qPCR amplicon, and calculated a Spearman-ranked correlation between the two data types. We find that the changes measured by 2C-ChIP correlate well with those evaluated by ChIP-qPCR (Fig. 2g). We also obtained similar ChIP-qPCR and 2C-ChIP results for SUZ12, a component of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) responsible for the silencing H3K27me3 mark (Additional\u00a0file\u00a07: Figure S1; Additional file 6: BED file 5, 6).The 2C-ChIP data presented above was generated with optimal DNA amounts (see below and Methods section). While optimizing the 2C-ChIP protocol, we noticed that the amount of DNA used to perform the LMA step of 2C-ChIP could impact results. Indeed, using too much gDNA sometimes led to inconsistent yields (Additional file 8: Figure S2b). This is particularly important when quantitative results are desired, especially since input samples tend to be concentrated and are used for 2C-ChIP normalization (see Methods section). To determine the optimal detection range, we titrated the amount of gDNA in 2C-ChIP assays using our HOXA region primer set to find that linearity is observed ranging from 0.16\u2009ng to 1.6\u2009ng and recommend using 1\u20132\u2009ng as it provides very reproducible yields as quantified by TaqMan (Additional file 8: Figure S2a, c, d). We sequenced these 2C-ChIP samples to assess how gDNA concentrations might affect the quality of libraries, and mapped the reads to our expected forward-reverse pairings. We observe that both the total read number and percentage of mapped 2C-ChIP products are maintained in this nanogram range (Additional file 8: Figure S2e), while\u00a0a very low quantity of gDNA generates fewer reads and a greater percentage of non-specific ligation products between forward and reverse primers (\u201coff-diagonal pairs\u201d; Additional file 8: Figure S2e, f, g). Based on these results, we chose to use approximately 1.6\u2009ng of input gDNA for each of our 2C-ChIP experiments.We tested whether expected epigenetic changes accompanied gene induction in these sample sets using RT-qPCR and found higher H3K4me3 at proximal gene promoters accompanied with decreased H3K27me3 levels specifically at induced genes over the time course (Additional\u00a0file\u00a010: Figure S4a). These changes correlated well with those measured by RT-qPCR in the first RA-induced datasets (Additional\u00a0file\u00a010: Figure S4b). We then used the fixed chromatin preparations to measure changes in the levels of H3K4me3, Ash2L, H3K27me3, SUZ12, CTCF, and UTX over the HOXA cluster region by 2C-ChIP (Fig. 4c-h; Additional file 6: BED file\u00a07\u201330). As with our first datasets, the 2C-ChIP results obtained for H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in the time course correlated highly with data measured by ChIP-qPCR, and with available ChIP-seq datasets from untreated NT2-D1 samples (Additional\u00a0file\u00a010: Figure S4c, d). Importantly, there was a very strong correlation between 2C-ChIP biological replicates (R2 ranging from 0.82 to 0.96), except for Ash2L and UTX, which upon closer inspection exhibited a high background within regions residing outside of the HOXA cluster serving as a negative control (Additional\u00a0file\u00a011: Figure S5; Additional\u00a0file\u00a012: Figure S6; Additional file 6: BED file\u00a031\u201336).From the 2C-ChIP analysis of our differentiation time course, we found that rapidly activated genes (HOXA1 and HOTAIRM1) acquire higher levels of H3K4me3 at their promoters and along gene bodies compared to those at the proximal region induced later by RA (Fig. 4c). We also observed that while the PRC2 component SUZ12 is rapidly ejected from the cluster (6\u2009h), the removal of associated silencing H3K27me3 mark occurs at a slower pace (Fig. 4e, f). The chromatin architectural protein CTCF conversely did not display notable changes when probed with our 2C-ChIP primer design, suggesting it remains stably anchored across cellular differentiation (Fig. 4g).Analyzing 2C-ChIP data in greater details, we noticed that a region within HOXA seemed less prone to loss of H3K27me3, (Fig. 4e, dashed black box), and even SUZ12 albeit to a lesser extent. Interestingly, sequences from this region have previously been shown to repress transcription when inserted in the drosophila genome [9]. This H3K27me3 \u201cisland\u201d overlaps perfectly with the HOXA-AS2 lncRNA gene induced later in the time course, and after HOTAIRM1. These observations suggest a functional relationship between the repressive nature of this H3K27-methylated genomic sequence and the expression of HOXA-AS2, perhaps through combinations of chromatin structure and conformation changes (see below).While the expression of some genes began tapering off seven days after RA induction (7d), we noticed that H3K4me3 continues to increase slightly over the time course, and more noticeably at HOXA5/6/7. This coincides with the continued induction of these genes at that time, including HOXA-AS2, which resides within a subdomain that progressively gains contacts during induction despite the fact that H3K27me3 continues to decrease (Fig. 5; Additional\u00a0file\u00a015: Figure S7c). Interestingly, this subdomain seemingly avoids any major interactions with neighboring genes throughout the time course (Fig. 5a-c). Considering how this area also persists in maintaining both H3K27me3 and SUZ12 after 3\u2009days (3d), we propose that \u201clooping out\u201d of this region might somehow protect it from the rapid removal of PRC2. Meanwhile, at the other end of the cluster, the distal genes are kept away from the rearrangements occurring at the 3\u2032 end \u2013 perhaps helped by the activity of CTCF bound between HOXA6 and HOXA7 [29] \u2013 as seen by the continuous loss of long-range contacts.As shown above, 2C-ChIP is a very reproducible approach to quantitatively measure ChIP signals over large, genome-scale DNA regions. It faithfully recapitulates data that would otherwise need to be generated by ChIP-qPCR or ChIP-seq. Like ChIP-qPCR, this method is quantitative but significantly less tedious. While we found that the amount of genomic DNA used to perform the LMA step of 2C-ChIP can affect the linearity of detection, this consideration is most relevant to input samples given that the amount of ChIP material generally falls within the linear detection range of the assay (Additional file 8: Figure S2b).2C-ChIP can be used to generate multiple profiles simultaneously over defined genomic regions, and because it uses much less ChIP material per reaction it can provide much more information per sample. 2C-ChIP also permits a better assessment of the quality of immunoprecipitations compared to ChIP-qPCR because it generates more detailed ChIP profiles. Unlike other dedicated ChIP readouts such as bead-capture [31, 32], or ChIP-on-chip [33, 34], the experimental design for 2C-ChIP can be easily and rapidly changed at very little cost simply by ordering new sets of 2C-ChIP primers. The use of oligonucleotides for LMA allows for a variety of probe designs to fit most experimental needs. Probes can be designed at gene promoters, suspected DNA enhancer regions, or can be tiled at variable densities across one or more genomic loci. Also, 2C-ChIP libraries can be multiplexed to explore numerous chromatin features such as histone marks and chromatin-bound proteins simultaneously. High coverage can be achieved by limiting the size of primers pools and/or the number of sequencing targets.High-cost modifications like biotinylation are not required and reverse 2C-ChIP primers can easily be 5\u2032 phosphorylated in-house with T4 polynucleotide kinase to save on cost. New regions can be added and problematic primers excluded from one experiment to the next such that optimization can be quickly accomplished. Different high-throughput sequencing platforms can be selected simply by altering the two PCR amplification primers.We developed 2C-ChIP to fill the need for a versatile, low cost, high-throughput method to quantitatively measure the abundance of DNA sequences in ChIP samples. The technique combines ChIP with LMA and deep sequencing to yield a robust molecular biology tool designed to probe large genomic regions of interest. While the flexible nature of 2C-ChIP makes it an interesting tool to investigate chromatin landscape, the ever-decreasing cost of deep sequencing will continue to establish it as the most cost-effective approach for the functional analysis of chromatin.The NTERA-2 clone D1 (NT2-D1) cells are from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; CRL-1973), and are cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 0.01% Penicillin/Streptomycin (\u2018complete\u2019 DMEM) as described previously [27]. Gene induction is with 10\u2009\u03bcM all-trans retinoic acid (RA; Sigma-Aldrich) as outlined in [7] . For the 3-day induced samples, the induction media is changed after 48\u2009h with cells collected on the following day. When cells are induced for seven days, the media is changed after 48\u2009h, the cells are passaged the next day in fresh induction media, and the induction media is changed again on the following day (96\u2009h).HOXA-AS2 knockdown is performed by reverse transfection with the Lipofectamine\u00ae RNAiMAX reagent and 45\u2009nM of small interfering RNA (siRNA) as instructed by the manufacturer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The control siRNA (siGFP; 5\u2032-GCAAGCTGACCCTGAAGTTC-3\u2032) is from GE Healthcare Dharmacon Inc. (cat. no. P-002048-01-20). HOXA-AS2 siRNAs (siAS2; 5\u2032-CAAGCUAUCUACAAGGUUUTT-3\u2032) are from Ambion\u00ae (Silencer\u00ae Select siRNAs). To induce cells, complete DMEM containing 10\u2009\u03bcM RA is added 6\u2009h after transfection. The cells are passaged and re-transfected in RA-containing media after 48\u2009h as described above and collected at the 5-day induction time point.Total RNA is extracted with the TRIzol\u00ae reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The RNA is then treated with DNAseI (RNase-free; New England BioLabs Inc.) for 15\u2009min at 37\u2009\u00b0C, and re-extracted with TRIzol\u00ae. For gene expression analysis, 1\u2009\u03bcg of DNAsed total RNA is used to generate cDNA with the SuperScript\u2122 III reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT)20 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is performed as described previously [10]. The primer sequences used for this analysis are presented in Additional file 1: Table S1.ChIP experiments are conducted as detailed previously [10] with cells fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10\u2009min and quenched with 0.125\u2009M glycine. Each ChIP is performed with 5 million cells, and 5\u2009\u03bcg of one of the following antibodies: H3K4me3 (Abcam; ab8580), H3K27me3 (Abcam; ab6002), SUZ12 (Abcam; ab12073), UTX (Bethyl Laboratories; A302-374A), Ash2L (Bethyl Laboratories; A300-489A), CTCF (Millipore; 07\u2013729), or control IgG (Abcam; ab37415). Magnetic Dynabeads\u00ae Protein G are used for pull down according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 10% of input chromatin is set aside and the purified genomic DNA (gDNA) is used as normalization control (see below). Final input and ChIP DNA are re-suspended in 50\u2009\u03bcl of 1X Tris-EDTA pH\u20098.The goal of this study was to develop a high-throughout methodology that can be used to profile specific genomic regions by ChIP. We designed this new approach to be quantitative, simple to implement, versatile in its design, and inexpensive. Below, we outline experimental details that complement our \u2018Results and discussion\u2019 section and that are essential to optimally implement the technique.Forward and reverse primers were designed complementary to the antisense strand in the human genome reference (hg19). The primer sequences were selected to have a GC content ranging between ~\u200940\u201360%, unique BLAT results, and limited possibilities in self-annealing and/or hairpin formation as estimated by the \u2018Oligo Calc\u2019 bioinformatics tool available at: http://biotools.nubic.northwestern.edu/OligoCalc.html. Primer homology lengths vary between 22 and 34 nucleotides. Forward 2C-ChIP primers include a 5\u2032-end tail corresponding to the complementary sequence of a modified T3 Universal primer (5\u2032-TAATTGGGAGTGATTTCCCT-3\u2032) (Fig. 1b, top). Reverse 2C-ChIP primers are designed to include a 3\u2032-end tail corresponding to the complementary P1-key sequence (5\u2032-ATCACCGACTGCCCATAGAGAGG-3\u2032) used with the PGM\u2122 sequencing system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The 2C-ChIP primer sequences used in this study are presented in Additional file 4 Table S4.To generate 2C-ChIP libraries, purified gDNA from ChIP samples (1% of H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 ChIPs; 10% of Ash2L, SUZ12, UTX, or CTCF; from 5 million cells and 5\u2009\u03bcg antibody as described above), or 1 to 2\u2009ng of the corresponding input gDNA is mixed with 1.5\u2009\u03bcg of salmon testis DNA (Sigma-Aldrich; cat. no. D7656), and 0.34 fmol of each 2C-ChIP primer (160 forward-reverse primer pairs in this study; final primer concentration of 34 pM), in annealing buffer (1X NEBuffer\u2122 4; New England Biolabs; cat. no. B7004S) and a final reaction volume of 10\u2009\u03bcl. The amount of input gDNA is estimated using the Quant-iT\u2122 PicoGreen\u2122 dsDNA Assay Kit as instructed by the manufacturer (Thermo Fisher Scientific; cat. no. P11496).Samples are denatured at 95\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009min and annealed overnight at 55\u2009\u00b0C. Annealed primer pairs are ligated the next day for 1\u2009h at 55\u2009\u00b0C with 10\u2009units of Taq DNA ligase (New England Biolabs; cat. no. M0208S) by adding 20\u2009\u03bcl of ligation buffer (25\u2009mM Tris-HCl at pH\u20097.6, 31.25\u2009mM potassium acetate, 12.5\u2009mM magnesium acetate, 1.25\u2009mM NAD, 12.5\u2009mM DTT, 0.125% Triton X-100) containing the enzyme. The reactions are terminated by heat-inactivating the enzyme at 65\u2009\u00b0C for 15\u2009min.2C-ChIP libraries (14\u2009\u03bcl) are then PCR-amplified 16\u2009cycles in a total reaction volume of 100\u2009\u03bcl using the \u20182C-ChIP library amplification primers\u2019 designed for sequencing on the PGM\u2122 system (Fig. 1b, bottom). These amplification primers can be modified as desired to be compatible with any other chosen sequencing platform. Here, the forward primer consists of (5\u2032-3\u2032): a forward A-key sequence followed by a barcode, then a modified T3 sequence. The reverse primer simply corresponds to the Ion Torrent\u2122 P1-key sequence that will hybridize onto the sequencing chips.PCR amplicons of ~\u2009160\u2009bp are next size-selected from the reactions using Sera-Mag SpeedBeads\u2122 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; cat. no. 09\u2013981-123). Purified libraries are then quantified using the Ion Library TaqMan\u2122 Quantitation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific; cat. no. 4468802) to estimate the proper dilution for sequencing. 2C-ChIP libraries are multiplexed (up to 10 libraries per sequencing run) at a combined 9 pM concentration, and processed for sequencing with a PGM\u2122 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as previously described [8] using the Ion 316\u2122 chip kit v2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; cat. no. 4483324).The FASTQ sequencing files of the multiplexed 2C-ChIP runs are first converted to a FASTA format and mapped to a custom reference sequence assembly featuring all possible barcode-Forward and Reverse 2C-ChIP primer combinations. Mapping is performed using BLAST (v2.5.0; [35]) with a minimum word size of 50, corresponding to the smallest expected product size. Reads not uniquely mapped after this iteration are re-mapped to a second custom reference sequence assembly consisting of the unpaired barcode-Forward, Forward, or Reverse 2C-ChIP primer sequences, using a minimum word size of 22 that corresponds to the length of one Forward primer \u2013 again, the smallest expected product size.This two-step mapping approach reduces the search space and runtime of the BLAST algorithm on this type of data because a majority of paired-end reads will align to the first database while short ones (i.e. those shorter than the minimum word length) will not uniquely map. The 2C-ChIP data from individual samples is next divided by barcodes. Each dataset is then normalized to quantitatively express the 2C-ChIP data relative to input. First, all datasets are normalized for read count. Next, all datasets are adjusted for the dilution made for sequencing based on TaqMan\u2122 quantitation. Data from the ChIP samples and their corresponding inputs is also adjusted to account for dilutions made to ensure linear 2C-ChIP detection. The ChIP sample data is further adjusted to account for the fact that only 10% of the input is processed. Finally, the ratio of normalized ChIP to normalized input is calculated.3C libraries are generated from aliquots of 2 million cells fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10\u2009min and quenched with 0.125\u2009M glycine. The 3C libraries are made using the BglII restriction enzyme as we described previously [36]. The 5C libraries are generated using the alternating Forward/Reverse (FR) 5C primers listed in Additional\u00a0file\u00a014: Table S6, and are sequenced as published previously [30].5C paired-end reads are sequenced on a PGM\u2122 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as previously described [8] using the Ion 314\u2122 chip kit v2 BC (Thermo Fisher Scientific; cat. no. 4488144). Sequenced products are mapped to a custom reference sequence assembly featuring all expected ligation products between Forward and Reverse 5C primers using the tools described in [8]. Mapped products were normalized for read count (reads per million) for comparison between libraries.The 2C-ChIP sequencing data generated for this study can be downloaded from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) website with the following link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRP155022; SRA accession number SRP155022.

Acquiring this knowledge, in turn, will demand the integration of many different types of information, including genomic sequence, epigenomic traits, and three-dimensional chromatin organization. Epigenomic information can be gained from robust complementary methodologies, one of which is chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), which is now considered a staple in gene expression studies. ChIP is a powerful technique used to map the association of proteins and their post-translational modifications on genomic DNA. This method typically uses formaldehyde cross-linking to reversibly secure proteins onto DNA (Fig.\u00a01a, top). DNA-protein complexes are next sheared via sonication, and proteins of interest are selectively immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies. The resulting associated DNA fragments are ultimately purified before sequence and abundance are determined.\n\nFig. 1\nCarbon copy-chromatin immunoprecipitation (2C-ChIP) combines ligation-mediated amplification and next-generation sequencing to measure co-immunoprecipitated DNA from given genomic regions. a Overview of the 2C-ChIP method. Chromatin is first immunoprecipitated with desired antibodies, and the resulting purified genomic DNA or corresponding input is used to produce a 2C-ChIP library by annealing and ligating 2C-ChIP primers in a multiplex setting. Resulting libraries are then PCR-amplified with primers featuring barcodes and processed for sequencing. b Bottom right insert highlights primer design in 2C-ChIP analysis. Genomic regions are detected by ligating Forward and Reverse 2C-ChIP primers annealed to the same DNA strand. Note that Reverse primers must be 5\u2019end-phosphorylated for ligation to occur. Primer design shown here is for sequencing on Ion Personal Genome Machine\u2122 (PGM\u2122) system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) but can be adapted for sequencing on any platform. Forward 2C-ChIP primers include a universal sequence of choice (here a T3 complementary sequence; T3c) at their 5\u2032 ends. Reverse 2C-ChIP primers are 5\u2032-phosphorylated and feature the complementary PGM\u2122 P1-key sequence (P1-key-c) destined to bind the Ion Sphere Particles (ISPs) used in sequencing. The libraries are then PCR-amplified with \u201c2C-ChIP library amplification primers\u201d to incorporate barcodes. The Forward amplification primer includes \u2013 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 \u2013 an A-key sequence used in the PGM\u2122 system, the barcode (BC), and a T3 sequence. The Reverse amplification primer is the P1-key sequence. Sequencing will occur from the A-key sequence such that barcodes will be read first\nWe developed and validated the 2C-ChIP approach by characterizing the HOXA gene cluster region in NT2-D1 cells (Fig.\u00a02a, b). The HOX genes are homeobox family members that encode helix-turn-helix transcription factors [11, 12]. In vertebrates, there are 39 HOX genes organized into 4 genomic clusters (A, B, C, and D) located on different chromosomes, with the human HOXA cluster residing on chromosome 7. HOX genes are highly conserved throughout evolution and play important roles both during development and adulthood.\n\nFig. 2\nResults of 2C-ChIP analysis at the HOXA gene cluster correlate well with corresponding ChIP-qPCR data. a Schematic representation of the HOXA gene cluster included in the genomic region characterized in this study. The protein-coding HOXA genes are represented by rectangles with left-facing arrows to indicate gene orientation. Grey arrows pointing to the right show the transcriptional start site positions of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) transcribed from the opposite strand. b Cell differentiation system used to develop and optimize the 2C-ChIP technique. Proximal HOXA (c) and lncRNA (d) genes are induced with RA. Steady state transcript levels measured by RT-qPCR are shown in (c) before (0\u2009h; left), and after (3\u2009days; right) cell treatment with 10\u2009\u03bcM RA. LncRNA levels (d) are presented on the same graph. The y-axis shows RNA levels relative to actin where dashed lines indicate values below which measurements are unreliable. All RNA measurements are from at least three PCRs in each of two biological replicates (Additional file 2: Table S2). Error bars represent standard deviations. e ChIP-qPCR analysis of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 changes occurring at select HOXA genes upon a 3-day RA treatment. Primer sequences are shown in Additional file 3: Table S3, and regions probed are highlighted in yellow in panel f. Error bars are standard deviations from at least 3 PCRs. f 2C-ChIP analysis of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 at the HOXA gene cluster before and upon RA treatment for 3\u2009days. Data shown here is limited to the region encoding genes and excludes most of the surrounding negative controls. Complete BED files are in Additional file 6: BED file\u00a01\u20134. g Correlation between ChIP-qPCR results and corresponding 2C-ChIP signals for H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 ChIPs in uninduced and 3-day RA-induced NT2-D1 cells (Spearman\u2019s rho\u2009=\u20090.93 for both assays)\nWe next compared our 2C-ChIP profiles with available ChIP-seq datasets from untreated NT2-D1 cells where the HOXA cluster is transcriptionally silent, covered with H3K27me3, and gene promoters are marked with H3K4me3 (Fig.\u00a03a, b, left). ChIP-seq data for SUZ12, which like the modification it catalyzes on histones covered the entire cluster region, was also available (Fig. 3c, left). With our primer design (Additional\u00a0file\u00a08: Figure S2a), 2C-ChIP recapitulated the distribution of histone marks and SUZ12 throughout the region. Similar patterns of peaks and valleys were observed with both approaches. In this case, to directly compare the two data types, we added all the ChIP-seq reads in the raw datasets spanning the corresponding probed 2C-ChIP sequences, and calculated the Spearman-ranked correlation. When quantified in this fashion, 2C-ChIP and ChIP-seq displayed strong positive correlations (H3K4me3: \u03c1s\u00a0=\u20090.74; H3K27me3: \u03c1s\u00a0=\u20090.68; SUZ12: \u03c1s\u00a0=\u20090.80), despite the fact that different antibodies were used and ChIP samples were prepared by different laboratories (Fig. 3a, b, c, right panels). Together, these results show that 2C-ChIP quantitatively recapitulates data obtained either by ChIP-qPCR or ChIP-seq, two current benchmark ChIP signal analysis approaches.\n\nFig. 3\n2C-ChIP and ChIP-seq results correlate well at the HOXA gene cluster. 2C-ChIP and ChIP-seq analysis of H3K4me3 (a), H3K27me3 (b), and SUZ12 (c) over the cluster region. Tracks seen on the left are limited to the gene-encoding region to highlight comparable detection of peaks and valleys by each assay. Complete 2C-ChIP BED files that include surrounding negative controls are in Additional file 6: BED file\u00a01, 3, and 5. Correlation between 2C-ChIP and ChIP-seq results is found on the right of each panel and is between regions featured in both assays, excluding measurements equal to zero. Spearman\u2019s rho is indicated on the bottom right of each graph\nHaving optimized 2C-ChIP, we then applied it to an NT2-D1 differentiation time course (Fig.\u00a04a). Our goal was to exploit 2C-ChIP\u2019s flexibility to analyze numerous ChIP libraries simultaneously, and explored this by probing six different chromatin components (below) across four time points. As done when developing and optimizing 2C-ChIP, we first measured gene expression at the HOXA cluster in our sample sets by RT-qPCR (Fig. 4b). We observed that treatment with RA dramatically induced the proximal HOXA and lncRNA genes, and that induction patterns in these datasets correlate well with the first datasets used to devise 2C-ChIP (Additional\u00a0file\u00a09: Figure S3). Notably, we found that gene induction proceeded in a manner that is consistent with the known collinear activation of HOXA genes during development. Indeed, while the most 3\u2032 proximal genes (HOXA1, and HOTAIRM1) were highly and rapidly expressed after the addition of RA (6\u2009h), other proximal genes were induced more progressively \u2013 not yet reaching a plateau even 7\u2009days post-induction while HOXA1 and HOTAIRM1 expression had started to decline by that time. This is in contrast to distal HOXA transcripts, which accumulated over time in this dataset.\n\nFig. 4\n2C-ChIP analysis of a differentiation time course identifies a HOXA cluster region resistant to H3K27me3 demethylation. a Time points of RA-induced NT2-D1 differentiation examined in this study. b Steady state transcript levels of HOXA and lncRNA genes as measured by RT-qPCR during RA treatment. RNA levels relative to actin are shown on the y-axis. Dashed lines indicate values below which measurements are unreliable. Oligonucleotide sequences used for quantification are shown in Additional file 1: Table S1. All RNA measurements are from at least three PCRs. c-h 2C-ChIP analysis of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 levels, and of the chromatin-binding proteins Ash2L, SUZ12, CTCF, and UTX during the RA induction time course. 2C-ChIP tracks are presented as described in Fig. 2f and Additional file\u00a07: Figure S1. The dashed black box identifies a HOXA cluster region slow to lose H3K27me3 signal. 2C-ChIP BED files including surrounding negative controls are in Additional file 6: BED file 7\u201330\nWe then set to study how changes in H3K27me3 and other chromatin marks translate into three-dimensional chromatin organization. To accomplish this, we performed 5C-seq analysis of the HOXA cluster in our time course samples (Fig.\u00a05; Additional file 13: 5C dataset 1\u20134; Additional\u00a0file\u00a014: Table S6). As we reported previously, RA induction changes spatial chromatin organization at the HOXA cluster [7]. As before, the proximal and distal parts of the cluster appeared physically separated and confined to their own topologically associating domains (TADs). Both regions were also organized into several partially overlapping subdomains (subTADs). We observed long-range contacts between early RA-induced proximal genes (HOXA1/2) and those destined for induction at a later time (HOXA5/6/7). However, in this dataset, the contact in untreated cells (0\u2009h) was weaker than previously seen [7], and seemingly depends on the state of the actively growing population. Such variability in the strength of this long-range contact in untreated cells can lead to differences in whether or not it is captured more frequently before or after induction with RA (Additional\u00a0file\u00a015: Figure S7a). Nevertheless, we saw progressively less long-range contacts within the proximal HOXA region as differentiation ensued, which was accompanied by greater short-range interaction frequencies, locally where genes were most expressed (Additional\u00a0file\u00a015: Figure S7). In fact, the greatest gain of contact was within the subTAD containing HOXA1 and HOTAIRM1, which are the two most induced genes of the time course. Given that the greatest increase in H3K4me3 is at this subdomain, this result suggests that here, 5C captures more contacts when genes have high H3K4me3 levels.\n\nFig. 5\nRA triggers extensive conformational changes at the HOXA cluster, including within a proximal subdomain where the H3K27me3 signal lingers. (a-d) The frequency of physical contacts along the HOXA cluster region is measured by 5C-seq in uninduced (a, 0\u2009h RA; Additional file 13: 5C dataset 1), and in cells induced with RA for 6\u2009h (b, 6\u2009h RA; Additional file 13: 5C dataset 2), 3\u2009days (c, 3d RA; Additional file 13: 5C dataset 3), or 7\u2009days (d, 7d RA; Additional file 13: 5C dataset 4). 5C libraries were prepared with samples matched to set B. Pairwise interaction frequencies (IFs) are presented in heatmap format (10\u2009kb bins, 10\u2009kb smoothing, 2x steps) according to the color scale on the left of each panel. The HOXA cluster region is aligned to scale between each heatmap, and its corresponding 2C-ChIP tracks. The area boxed in dashed black lines within each panel highlights the region where H3K27me3 is cleared more slowly. Within heatmaps, the black dashed lines separating the proximal and distal genes indicate the TAD boundary identified previously [37]. The two main proximal subdomains found in uninduced (a, 0\u2009h RA) cells are outlined in dashed black lines, and featured in the other panels as visual aids to follow conformational changes. The white boxes show long-range interactions between proximal genes. The subdomain outlined with yellow dashed lines highlights the region where H3K27 demethylation is slow. The areas shaded in yellow along the tracks identify regions characterized by ChIP-qPCR in Additional\u00a0file\u00a010: Figure S4\nWe wondered what role \u2013 if any \u2013 might the HOXA-AS2 lncRNA play during HOXA gene induction by RA. We probed this question by examining gene expression, chromatin landscape, and three-dimensional chromatin organization of the HOXA cluster region in RA-induced samples depleted of the lncRNA (Fig.\u00a06). RNAi knockdown using an siRNA against the transcript\u2019s 3\u2032 end considerably reduced the accumulation of HOXA-AS2 during a 5-day RA treatment. We found that this drastically reduces the expression of all the proximal HOXA genes (Fig. 6a, b, c). 5C-seq analysis of matching knockdown samples revealed that curbing HOXA-AS2 accumulation led to greater contact frequencies within its own subTAD, and much fewer long-range interactions within the proximal region, perhaps contributing to the lower HOXA levels by distancing enhancers from genes (Fig. 6d, e, top; Additional file 13: 5C dataset 5, 6). Moreover, 2C-ChIP analysis shows that lower H3K4me3 levels at all promoters accompanied these changes without H3K27me3 changes at gene bodies (Fig. 6d, e, bottom; Additional file 6: BED file\u00a037\u201340). Together, these results show that HOXA-AS2 is required to enhance expression of all the cluster\u2019s RA-responsive genes by promoting high H3K4me3 levels at promoters, perhaps by controlling the cluster\u2019s three-dimensional chromatin organization.\n\nFig. 6\nHOXA-AS2 is required to achieve high expression levels of the proximal HOXA genes during RA induction in NT2-D1 cells. a Diagram of the HOXA gene cluster as described in Fig. 2b. The HOXA-AS2 gene is shown below the cluster and enlarged to better visualize the position of siAS2 used to deplete the lncRNA during RA induction (red line). b, c Analysis of proximal HOXA gene expression during RNAi knockdown of HOXA-AS2 with siAS2. Steady state levels of HOXA and lncRNA genes are measured by RT-qPCR in control (siGFP) and HOXA-AS2 (siAS2) knockdown cells induced 5\u2009days with 10\u2009\u03bcM RA. Fold change (c) is relative to the siGFP control set at 1. All measurements are from at least 3 PCRs, with error bars representing standard deviations.d RNAi depletion of HOXA-AS2 during RA induction leads to lower long-range contacts at the proximal HOXA region, and higher contact frequencies within the subdomain where it resides. Data is shown in heatmap form according to the color scale on the left and as described in Fig. 5. 2C-ChIP analysis of H3K4me3 (Additional file 6: BED file\u00a037, 38), and H3K27me3 (Additional file 6: BED file\u00a039, 40) in control and HOXA-AS2-knockdown cells is shown below the heatmaps. e Changes in the frequency of chromatin contacts occurring upon RNAi depletion of HOXA-AS2 during a 5-day RA induction. Heatmap values are IF differences between the HOXA-AS2 and control knockdown samples that are color-coded according to the scale on the left, with blue indicating a loss of contact and red showing a gain. Tracks under the differential heatmap are changes in chromatin mark levels or bound proteins detected with 2C-ChIP. Regions highlighted in heatmaps are as described in Fig. 5.

The 2C-ChIP libraries quantified in d were sequenced on a PGMTM system to show that both total reads and percentage of expected mappable pairs decrease when very low gDNA amounts are used to generate 2C-ChIP samples. Expected mappable pairs are those between adjacent forward and reverse primers. f, g Low gDNA amount in 2C-ChIP assays increases the incidence of non-specific ligation between 2C-ChIP primers. Most unexpected sequence reads (~92%) consist of products between non-adjacent (off-diagonal) primer pairs. The optimal 2C-ChIP linear detection range highlighted in orange (panels c, d, and g) is based both on reproducible yield and high percentage of expected mappable reads.

Recent research elucidating the cellular mechanism of heat stress leading to heat illness may provide information to develop better therapeutic interventions, risk assessment strategies, and early biomarkers of organ damage. microRNA (miRNA) are promising candidates for therapeutic targets and biomarkers for a variety of clinical conditions since there is the potential for high specificity for individual tissues and unique cellular functions. The objective of this study was to identify differentially expressed microRNAs and their putative mRNA targets in the heart, liver, kidney, and lung in rats at three time points: during heat stress (i.e., when core temperature reached 41.8\u2009\u00b0C), or following a 24 or 48\u2009h recovery period.Rats did not show histological evidence of tissue pathology until 48\u2009h after heat stress, with 3 out of 6 rats showing cardiac inflammation and renal proteinosis at 48\u2009h. The three rats with cardiac and renal pathology had 86, 7, 159, and 37 differentially expressed miRNA in the heart, liver, kidney, or lung, respectively compared to non-heat stressed control animals. During heat stress one differentially expressed miRNA was found in the liver and five in the lung, with no other modulated miRNA after 24\u2009h or 48\u2009h in animals with no evidence of organ injury. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed enrichment in functional pathways associated with heat stress, with the greatest effects observed in animals with histological evidence of cardiac and renal damage at 48\u2009h. Inhibiting miR-21 in cultured cardiomyocytes increased the percent apoptotic cells five hours after heat stress from 70.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8 to 84.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2%.Global microRNA and transcriptomics analysis suggested that perturbed miRNA due to heat stress are involved in biological pathways related to organ injury, energy metabolism, the unfolded protein response, and cellular signaling. These miRNA may serve as biomarkers of organ injury and potential pharmacological targets for preventing heat illness or organ injury.Heat illness is a continuum of disorders caused by hyperthermia, and includes clinical outcomes such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heat injury, and heat stroke [1\u20133]. Excessive physiological strain or heat load in combination with other strains (e.g., work, fatigue, excessive clothing and dehydration) contribute to the onset of heat illness [4, 5]. Heat illness is preventable by proper hydration and cooling, but heat illness remains a significant public health concern. Between 1997 and 2006, an estimated 54,983 exertional heat-related injuries were treated in emergency departments in the United States nationally [6]. Between 1999 and 2009, an average of 658 total heat-related deaths occurred in the United States annually [7]. Improved risk assessments and heat-related injury biomarkers are needed to evaluate heat-related injuries and prevent deaths.At the cellular level, the in vitro heat shock and stress response is well known [8, 9]. Central to the heat shock response is the activation of the heat shock factor (HSF) transcription factor, leading to the production of heat shock proteins (HSPs), which chaperone misfolded proteins [10\u201312]. Heat stress inhibits DNA synthesis, transcription, RNA processing, and translation, potentially leading to cell cycle arrest. Excessive heat causes protein denaturation and aggregation with subsequent protein degradation by proteasomes and lysosomes. Additionally, heat stress interferes with energy metabolism, resulting in a decrease in ATP. Our previous modeling studies demonstrate that the heat shock response is initially acute and self-limiting at lower temperatures, due to the negative feedback loop between HSF and HSP [13]. As temperature and exposure times increase, transcriptional and translational efficiency decrease; the negative feedback loop loses efficacy; and HSF activation predominates, leading to a much more persistent activation of the transcription factor.The in vivo heat stress response at the cellular and systemic levels is not well characterized as the physiological response to hyperthermia [9, 14]. In our recent panomics studies [15, 16], we reported that rats with heat-related cardiac pathology had enriched pathways associated with proteotoxic stress and/or large functional complexes. Cardiac injury coincided with significantly enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways [17] associated with oxidative phosphorylation, antigen processing and presentation, and cardiac muscle contractility. The enrichment is consistent with protein folding disorders, mitochondrial dysfunction, and perturbation in cellular energetics. These results are concordant with studies published by Ciryam et .al [18], citing proteotoxic stress and protein aggregation as a mechanism for degenerative diseases caused by the unfolded protein response in humans.In the present study, we investigate microRNA (miRNA) regulators of the transcriptomic and proteomic response to heat stress reported in our previous study. miRNA are approximately 22 nucleotide sequences which epigenetically bind to and predominately negatively regulate mRNA transcription. miRNA may be tissue-specific, making them attractive therapeutic targets for a variety of diseases [19]. We hypothesized that distinct patterns of miRNA expression correspond to heat stress, recovery, and the cardiac and renal pathology observed in our conscious rat model of heat stress. Further, we predicted that mapping these differentially expressed miRNA and their putative mRNA targets to cellular pathways would elucidate potentially novel cellular mechanisms and pharmacological targets for heat illness.In vivo rat experiments were performed at the United States Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine. Husbandry, exposure to heat, tissue collection, physiological and hematological parameter collection, and histopathologic analysis were conducted as previously described in Rakesh et al. (2013) and Stallings et al. (2014). Briefly, Fischer 344 rats (Charles River Laboratories, Stone Ridge, NY) were heated until their core temperature reached 41.8\u2009\u00b0C as measured by implanted telemetry probe (Tc,max). The animals were euthanized and heart, liver, kidney, and lung tissue were collected at Tc,max and 24 and 48\u2009h after recovery (n\u00a0=\u20096 per cohort). Control animals were placed in an incubator maintained at room temperature, and rats were sacrificed at concurrent time points (n\u2009=\u20096 total). Portions of each tissue were both flash frozen for cryopreservation at \u2212\u200980\u2009\u00b0C in cryovials and also prepared for histology by fixation in 10% formalin and hematoxylin and eosin staining. Tissue pathology was assessed by a board-certified veterinary pathologist.Frozen lung, liver, and kidney tissue were placed on dry ice, cut into aliquots with a sterile scalpel on a pre-chilled titanium block, and placed in new pre-chilled tubes. The block was washed with RNase Zap (Ambion, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) between samples. While working on dry ice, whole tissues (~\u200925\u2009mg) from the lung, liver, heart, and kidney were cut from each sample and placed in 700\u2009mL of QIAzol Lysis Reagent. Samples were homogenized with a TissueLyzer LT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) for 5\u2009min at 25\u2009Hz twice, allowed to sit at room temperature for 5\u2009min, and then placed at \u2212\u200980\u2009\u00b0C.We homogenized heart tissue with a Spex 6750 Freezer Mill with three sample microvials (Spex SamplePrep, Metuchen, NJ). Approximately 1\u2009cm3 of heart tissue was excised, dipped into liquid nitrogen, and then placed into pre-assembled and pre-chilled microvials containing 200\u2009\u03bcL of QIAzol. An impactor was added to each microvial, securely capped, and placed in the mill. The Freezer Mill settings were as follows: T1 run time\u2009=\u00a03\u2009min, T2 intermission\u2009=\u00a01\u2009min, T3 pre-cool\u2009=\u00a05\u2009min, rate\u2009=\u200915, and cycles\u2009=\u20092. After completion, we added 500\u2009\u03bcL of QIAzol to each vial, allowed the vial to sit at room temperature for 5\u2009min, transferred the sample to a microfuge tube, and then placed it at \u2212\u200980\u2009\u00b0C.The following day, we allowed all samples to thaw and isolated RNA using the miRNeasy 96 kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The quality and quantity of RNA samples were evaluated with a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Reagents and a multi-well Nanodrop 8000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).We prepared cDNA from total RNA using the Ambion Whole Transcript (WT) Expression Kit (Ambion) as previously described [15]. The cDNA was fragmented, labeled, hybridized, stained, and washed per the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Samples were then applied to the Rat Gene 1.1 ST 16 Array Plate or 24 Array Plate and placed in the GeneTitan System (Affymetrix) according the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Of the 144 arrays, 2 liver arrays, 1 lung array, and 1 heart array did not pass quality control checks and were excluded from further analysis.Small RNA libraries were constructed using the TruSeq small RNA library preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Total RNA was ligated to 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 adaptors containing bases targeting small RNAs and sequencing primer sequences, respectively. Adaptor-ligated small RNA molecule enrichment was achieved by reverse transcription followed by limited-cycle polymerase chain reaction with sample-specific barcode tags incorporated at this step. The quality and concentration of newly constructed libraries were assessed with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Small RNA libraries constructed from the same type of tissue were pooled together in equimolar amounts and separated on 6% Novex Tris-Borate-EDTA gels (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) for size selection. Gel-purified sequencing libraries were quantified using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (Kapa Biosystems, Woburn, MA) and diluted to a final concentration of 2\u2009nM.Cluster generation of the small RNA sequencing libraries and a PhiX control library was performed using an automated cBot system (Illumina). All sequencing libraries were loaded onto a TruSeq single-read flow cell v3 at a concentration of 12 pM. The small RNA sequencing libraries were spiked with 1% (vol/vol) PhiX control library and loaded onto four individual flow cell lanes based on the tissue of origin as each lane contained multiplexed sequencing libraries. The small RNA libraries were sequenced using the Illumina HiScan SQ system for a total of 58\u2009cycles. The performance of the sequencing run and quality of raw sequence data were assessed based on the reports created by the Illumina Sequence Analysis Viewer. All reported parameters met the quality assessment criteria recommended by the manufacturer.To obtain the spectrum of miRNA in samples, the sequence files (Fastq files) were preprocessed before being mapped to the miRNA database. In the preprocess step, adapter sequences were trimmed with Cutadapt software (version 2.6) [20]. In addition, low complexity sequences, such as homopolymer sequences, were removed with the Prinseq tool (version 0.20.4) [21]. To reduce the time required for sequence mapping, the redundant sequences in the file were collapsed with the FASTX collapse script obtained from the FASTX toolkit (version 0.0.13) [22]. The number of reads for each unique sequence were calculated and used in summarizing the mapping read count. The unique read sequences were then mapped against the reference rat miRNA sequence database from miRBase (Release 19) under the perfect match condition [23\u201327]. The sequencing data can be found in the Gene Expression Omnibus with the accession number GSE81331.A total of 1040 miRNA was identified. Differentially expressed miRNA were determined using the R package edgeR [28, 29] with each tissue analyzed individually. To remove miRNA that were not expressed above background, we removed any miRNA that did not have at least 5 reads in all samples of at least 1 condition. Differentially expressed miRNA were chosen as those with an FDR\u2009<\u20090.05 when tested against a 1.25 fold change cutoff using the glmTREAT function of edgeR.KEGG pathway analysis was conducted in DAVID [30, 31] using human homologs of miRNA and mRNAs. We used differentially expressed miRNA for each condition and any mRNA in the same condition from our previous work [15] that changed by at least 1.5-fold for this analysis. Using the miRNA target analysis in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) [32], we identified mRNA from the microarray experiment that were predicted or validated targets of the differentially expressed miRNA. We limited the targets to those that were changing in the opposite direction of the miRNA. KEGG pathway analysis was then conducted on the union of all targeted mRNA by all differentially expressed miRNA in a condition using DAVID. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.We also conducted in vitro experiments to further investigate the role that miR-21 plays in the response to heat stress as it was one of the most dysregulated miRNA. The rat myoblast-derived cell line H9c2 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was grown in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 10\u2009mL Glutamax (Invitrogen) in T75 flasks incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C with 5% carbon dioxide. Cells were plated in six-well plates at a density of 30,000 cells/well and after 4\u2009days were transfected with either a miRNA mimic to increase the expression of miR-21, an inhibitor to decrease the expression, or the transfection vehicle only as a control. Transfection was performed using a mirVANA miRNA mimic and inhibitor (mmu-miR-21a-3p, Life Technologies) and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Successful transfection was verified by quantitative PCR (data not shown). One day after transfection, cells were either heated to 47\u2009\u00b0C or remained at 37\u2009\u00b0C, and apoptosis was measured after 2, 3, 4 and 5\u2009h using the Guava Nexin Assay on the easyCyte HT system (Guava, Hayward, CA) per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. A two sample t-test determined statistical significance (p\u00a0<\u20090.05).Physiological profiles of the rats used in this study were consistent with dehydration and/or kidney function impairment (including increased blood urea nitrogen and change in electrolytes at Tc,Max) as detailed in our previous reports [15, 16, 33]. Rats in the heat-stressed cohorts reached 41.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u2009\u00b0C (Tc,Max) in 2\u20133\u2009h [33]. As previously reported, no heat-related pathologies were observable by histology at Tc,max or 24\u2009h after heating (Additional\u00a0File\u00a01 and [15, 16]). At 48\u2009h after heating, three of the six heat-stressed rats had histological evidence of moderate cardiac inflammation and cardiomyocyte degeneration with increased kidney proteinosis (Additional File 1). The three animals with evidence of organ injury demonstrated transcriptomic profiles different from the other heat stressed rats at 48\u2009h and controls in our previous work. Therefore, in order to identify biomarkers and mechanisms leading to organ injury, these three animals were analyzed as a separate treatment group.Heat stress is known to affect cellular function through protein misfolding and aggregation, the degradation of these damaged proteins, and the disruption of metabolism leading to a decrease in ATP, and the activation of cell signaling pathways [9, 34]. Many of the enriched KEGG pathways and differentially expressed miRNA are involved in these well-studied responses to heat stress. These processes are especially evident in the animals with heat induced organ injury. This study uses a global miRNA/mRNA analysis approach to place miRNA and their presumptive targets within the context of biological pathways. Our study offers a systems-based multi-organ approach to understanding miRNA involvement in the biomolecular basis of the heat stress response.Little to no evidence exists for organ injury in any early time point in any tissue. No major histopathological findings indicated injury in any tissue before 48\u2009h. Additionally, no KEGG pathways or miRNA related to organ injury were enriched before 48\u2009h in any tissue. However, in animals with histopathological evidence of injury at 48\u2009h, miRNA that may be linked to organ injury were modulated in the kidney.In the hearts of animals with injury, pathways associated with cardiomyopathy and organ injury were enriched. The KEGG pathways arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and dilated cardiomyopathy are enriched in the heart tissue of the injured animals. These terms are not enriched at any time point in those animals without evidence of injury. Additionally, miR-208 and miR-499 have been reported to be indicators of cardiac injury or modulated in heart disease [35, 36]. The pathways related to cardiomyopathy enriched solely in the heart tissue of animals with histopathological evidence of injury further suggest that these three animals sustained a more severe injury and/or failed to recover compared with the other, uninjured animals at 48\u2009h. The up-regulation of particular miRNA with a failure to recover would be particularly useful for identifying individuals who are at greater future risk of heat illness or organ injury following an earlier episode of heat stress.Furthermore, some of the differentially expressed miRNA have been implicated in heart disease or have been identified as potential biomarkers. In mice, the miR-29 family regulates profibrotic genes and is also modulated after myocardial infarction [37]. In our work rno-miR-29c, rno-miR29c-3p, and rno-miR-29b-3p are all down-regulated and would therefore enhance the fibrotic response, indicating a progression toward heart failure [36]. miR-208 and miR-499 play important roles in the heart and are at most minimally detectable in the plasma of healthy humans. However, both of these miRNA are elevated in the plasma of both an animal model and human patients with acute myocardial infarction, with miR-208 being the more reliable biomarker for injury [36]. In our data, rno-miR-499, rno-miR-499-5p, rno-miR-208a, and rno-miR-208a-5p are down-regulated in the heart of the injured animals. Interestingly, rno-miR-208a, rno-miR-499, and rno-miR-499-5p are all up-regulated in the lung of the injured animals. Additionally, miR-92a, which is thought to play a role in angiogenesis, is up regulated after the induction of acute myocardial infarction in a mouse model, which is reflected by the up-regulation of rno-miR-92a-3p in the heart of the injured animals [38]. These preclinical studies suggest that there is a set of miRNA that may be useful for assessing cardiac damage from thermal injury as well as from other causes.The differentially expressed miRNA in the liver also reflect the histopathologic evidence of liver damage. The over expression of miR-199 has been associated with the progression of liver fibrosis in a previous study examining liver fibrosis in human liver biopsies and is up-regulated in our work in the liver of the injured animals [41]. Additionally, miR-146b was differentially expressed among the different grades of liver fibrosis and is up-regulated in this work in the liver of the injured animals [41]. Therefore, we confirm the differential expression of these two markers of organ injury confirmed by our histopathological findings.Heat stress is also known to alter energy metabolism, resulting in a net decrease in ATP production [8]. Accordingly, many of the differentially expressed miRNA and enriched KEGG pathways in our work suggest a disruption in energy production in the injured animals. While no pathways are enriched in the liver, metabolism related pathways are enriched in the kidney and heart of the injured animals.Perhaps the greatest effect of the disruption of energy metabolism was seen in the heart of the injured animals. Many pathways related to energy metabolism are enriched in the heart of the injured animals including metabolic pathways, fatty-acid metabolism, and the citrate cycle. As seen in the liver, Acsl1 and as well as many other transcripts involved in fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation such as acyl-CoA dehydrogenase medium chain (Acadm), enoyl-CoA hydratase, short chain 1 (Echs1) and hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Hadh) are down-regulated. Acadm is predicted to be targeted by rno-miR-132-3p and rno-miR-222, Echs2 by rno-miR-18a-5p and rno-miR-214, and Hadh by rno-31a-dp and rno-miR-19b-3p. With many transcripts involved in fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation being down-regulated with the levels of their predicted miRNA regulators increased, we see evidence of a sustained energy crisis in the heart of the injured animals and a potential decrease in ATP production.In our microarray data, glucose transporter type 4 (Slc2a4) is down-regulated 9.5-fold in the heart of injured animals compared with control animals suggesting it may play a role in decreased metabolic activity due to heat stress [15]. SLC2A4 is primarily responsible for the intake of glucose into fat and muscle from peripheral tissues [42]. SLC2A4 is normally sequestered in internal compartments but is translocated to the plasma membrane upon stimulation by insulin through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway, which is enriched in the heart of the injured animals [43]. Additionally, rno-miR-20a-5p and rno-miR-31a-5p, which are predicted to target Slc2a4, are up-regulated in the heart of injured animals. This suggests that heat stress caused a prolonged decrease in energy metabolism involving a decrease in Slc2a4 expression that may be influenced by an up-regulation of its predicted regulators, rno-miR-20a-5p and rno-miR-31a-5p.The disruption of energy metabolism is also evident in the kidney of the injured animals as the carbohydrate digestion and absorption and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids pathways are enriched. The four genes responsible for the enrichment of the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids pathway are bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (Baat), acyl-CoA thioesterase 7 (Acot7), 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase 3 (Hacd3), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (Scd). Baat is predicted to be targeted by rno-miR-143 and is down-regulated in the transcriptomic data. Rno-miR-143 and rno-miR-322-5p are predicted to target Acot7 which is up-regulated. Hacd3 is down-regulated and is predicted to be targeted by rno-miR-3588 and rno-miR-3585-5p. Scd, which is down-regulated, is predicted to be a target of many of the differentially expressed miRNA in the kidney of the injured animals including rno-let-7e, rno-miR-3588, rno-miR-351-5p, rno-miR-138-5p, rno-miR-200b-3p, rno-miR-22-3p, rno-miR-221-3p, rno-miR-27b-5p, rno-miR-324-5p, and rno-miR-410-5p. Overall, the dysregulation of the fatty acid biosynthesis and other energy metabolism related miRNA and transcripts suggests that the energy crisis and net decrease in ATP production continued in the kidney of the injured animals.While it appears energy metabolism plays an immediate role in the response to heat stress, the greatest effect seemed to be in injured animals. This may suggest that the uninjured animals were able to recover fully from the stress, whereas the energy dysregulation continued in the animals with histopathological evidence of injury.Various cell signaling pathways may also be perturbed as the animals either adapted to or were injured by heat stress. Many pathways related to cell signaling were enriched in multiple tissues and time points, although these pathways were especially evident in the injured animals.Signaling pathways influenced by miRNA expression were effected at early time points in the lung. Both the TNF signaling and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways are enriched in the lung at Tc,max. NOD-like receptors have been shown to be sensors of intracellular stress and infection [44]. The three transcripts that are differentially expressed in this pathway, heat shock protein 90 beta family member 1 (Hsp90b1), PYD and CARD domain containing (Pycard), and C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (Ccl5), are predicted to be targeted by rno-miR-15b (HSP90B1) and rno-miR-122-5p (Pycard and Ccl5) suggesting these miRNA are involved in the regulation of the NOD-like proteins response to heat stress. A study by Imao and colleagues suggested that depending on the length of the heat stress event, TNF-\u03b1 could promote or prevent liver cell death [45]. The modulated genes in the TNF signaling pathway are predicted to be targets of rno-miR-15b (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2, Jun proto-oncogene, and HNHc-like endonuclease) and rno-miR-92a-1-5p (Ccl5), suggesting these two miRNA are involved the regulation of the TNF signaling pathway perhaps in a return to homeostasis.Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are involved in regulating multiple biological functions including energy metabolism. PPARs are transcription factors involved in the regulation of lipid and glucose homeostasis [46] and may also influence the transcriptional response to heat stress [47]. The PPAR signaling pathway is enriched in the heart, kidney, and lung of the injured animals. Differentially expressed miRNA in the heart of injured animals are predicted to target peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (Ppargc1a) while a miRNA modulated in the lung is predicted to target Ppar-\u03b1. Ppargc1a contains a predicted binding site for rno-miR-193-3p, whereas Ppar-\u03b1 contains binding sites for rno-miR-22-3p. Both miRNA are up-regulated in their respective tissues and their targets are down-regulated in the transcriptomic data, suggesting an expected down regulation of PPARs. While PPARs are involved in lipid and glucose homeostasis, they also affect other pathways. PPAR-\u03b1 also responds to chemical-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, and tissue growth [48]. Therefore, these miRNA may be involved in regulating energy metabolism or secondary effects in the heart of injured animals through the control of PPARs.Heat stress can also cause an increase of denatured and aggregated proteins, which are then degraded through proteasomal and lysosomal pathways [34]. In the animals with histopathological evidence of injury, we observed evidence of a response to unfolded proteins, especially in the heart. In the heart and lung of the injured animals the protein digestion and absorption pathway is enriched, while the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway is enriched in the heart. Additionally, many modulated genes and the miRNA which target them are involved in the unfolded protein response. Many of the members of DNAJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) are targeted by rno-miR-29c, rno-miR-34c-5p, rno-miR-214, rno-miR-351-5p, rno-miR-429, rno-let-7i-5p, rno-miR-193-3p, rno-miR-20a-5p, rno-miR-92a-3p, rno-miR-146b-5p, rno-miR-133a-5p, rno-miR-182, rno-miR-19b-3p, rno-miR-141-3p, rno-miR-9a-5p, or rno-miR-490. The majority of the miRNA regulation is resulting in a down-regulation of Hsp40, with the exception of Dnajc2, Dnac3, and Dnajc9. The DNAJ protein family is co- chaperone with heat shock protein 70, which are both then involved in protein folding and degradation [49]. Heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 9 (Hspa9) is also down-regulated in the transcriptomic data and is predicted to be a target of rno-miR-429. Additionally, members of the heat shock protein 90 family are modulated in our transcriptomic data [15] and are predicted to be targets of the differentially expressed miRNA. These transcripts are up-regulated and targets of rno-miR-9a-5p, rno-miR-1, and rno-miR-181d. While HSP40 and HSP70 seem to be involved in the early stages of protein folding, the HSP90 family of proteins are more specialized and involved in the late stages of folding, preventing the aggregation of proteins [50]. With most of the transcripts of Hsp40 and Hsp70 down-regulated and those of Hsp90 being up-regulated, the injured animals may be undergoing an extended response to unfolded proteins and may have continued stress from protein aggregation.The Cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein may another key regulator of the heat stress response. In the heart of the injured animals, rno-miR-133a-5p and rno-miR-185-5p are up-regulated and are predicted to target Cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein 3-like protein 2 (Creb3l2), which is down-regulated, while rno-miR-125b-1-3p and rno-miR-152-5p are down-regulated and predicted to target Cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein 3-like protein 3 (Creb3l3), which is up-regulated. Both Creb3l2 and Creb3l3 are thought to be active in times of endoplasmic reticulum stress and activate genes involved in the unfolded protein response [51]. However, Creb3l3 has also been reported to have a role in maintaining energy homeostasis, which may explain the disparate direction of regulation between the two proteins [52].miR-21 has one of the greatest fold change differences in the heart of the injured animals, suggesting it plays an important role in cardiac injury and the heat stress response. miR-21 is one of the most extensively studied miRNA and has previously been implicated in both protective and pathological roles in the heart [53]. We suggest that miR-21 is differentially expressed in response to heat-induced protein damage and disrupted energy metabolism. miR-21 may be furthering an adaptive response in lieu of cell death through interaction with the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which has been shown to have cardioprotective effects against ischemia-reperfusion injury [54]. The protective effects occur through the attenuation of apoptosis, which requires Akt phosphorylation. Sayed and colleagues (2010) demonstrated that miR-21 is a regulator of Akt, thereby mediating the anti-apoptotic effects [55]. Indeed, animals with overexpressed miR-21 had smaller infarct size and ameliorated heart failure. Additionally, miR-21 is upregulated or identified as a potential biomarker in many types of cancer and human disease, influencing many cellular pathways processes such as the p53 pathway, cell proliferation, and apoptosis [56]. It has even been suggested to play a role in psychological stress, likely through its role in the regulation of apoptosis [57]. Therefore, miR-21 may be up-regulated in our study diminishing apoptosis through involvement with the Akt signaling pathway, which was enriched in the heart of injured animals.Furthermore, miR-21 has been shown to have a protective effect against ischaemia/reperfusion injury in rats by reducing cardiac cell apoptosis [58]. Therefore, we tested an in vitro cell model to determine if changing the levels of the mir-21 in H9c2 would enhance or diminish apoptosis in the cells. After 5\u2009h of heat, the cells with decreased levels of miR-21 did show a greater percentage of apoptotic cells than control. This further suggests that miR-21 may play a role in protecting the heart against stress and may serve as an attractive therapeutic.As with most \u2018omics studies, a limitation to this study is the low statistical power due to sample size. This is most evident with our samples at the 48\u2009h time point where the data for the injured and uninjured animals were separated into two groups. While these groupings are consistent with the transcriptomic and metabolic profiles seen in our companion studies [15, 16]. Nevertheless, it was in these injured animals where we found the greatest number of differentially expressed miRNA. However, the reduced statistical power may result in us not identifying these same miRNA as differentially expressed at other time points with larger sample number. The majority of the differentially expressed miRNA we discuss showed limited or no fold change in uninjured animals with larger changes in the injured animals. With limited sample numbers and the use of an FDR designed to limit false positives, we increase the risk of a Type II error and may not have identified all differentially expressed miRNA.In our study, we were able to identify differentially expressed miRNA involved in the major functional responses to heat stress in multiple tissues and time points. These miRNA may target mRNAs that are implicated in organ injury, the unfolded protein response, cell signaling, and energy metabolism.Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of our study was the ability to distinguish between injured and uninjured animals at 48\u2009h. We were able to identify miRNA and KEGG pathways related to the known effects of heat stress as well as those that indicate organ injury. The differentially expressed miRNA unique to injured animals may indicate the severity of the injury as they gradually increased along the study timeline and had the largest fold change in injured animals. Some of the miRNA that suggest organ injury are known to be released into the plasma and may therefore be candidate biomarkers of organ injury due to heat stress or other causes.Overall, our study identified miRNA that changed in response to heat stress. We identified pathways that may be regulated by the differentially expressed miRNA using the targeted mRNA data from a companion study. Upon further study, these miRNA may serve as biomarkers for organ injury due to heat stress or as potential therapeutic intervention points or preventatives against heat stress injury.This research was supported in part by an appointment to the Research Participation Program at the USACEHR administered by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education through an interagency agreement between the U.S. Department of Energy and U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command and USACEHR.

Among all samples, we identified 1040 Rattus norvegicus miRNA, of which 292, 397, 256, or 426 miRNA in the heart, kidney, liver, or lung, respectively, had more than 5 reads in all samples of at least one condition. We removed the three animals with evidence of cardiac and kidney proteinosis at 48\u2009h from the analysis and identified differentially expressed miRNA at Tc,Max, 24, and 48\u2009h with an FDR\u2009<\u20090.05 tested against a fold-change threshold of 1.25 (Additional\u00a0File\u00a02). To identify potential biomarkers specific to organ injury, we identified differentially expressed miRNA with an FDR\u2009<\u20090.05 tested against a fold-change threshold of 1.25 in the three animals with cardiac and renal lesions after 48\u2009h (Table\u00a01 and Additional File 2). Overall, few miRNA were perturbed in tissues of animals without histological evidence of injury at all time points. However, low sample number, especially in the stratified 48\u2009h groups, results in a lower powered study, limiting the ability to detect differentially expressed miRNAs. One miRNA in the liver and five miRNA in the lung were differentially expressed at Tc,max, while no miRNA were changing in any other time point or tissue of the uninjured animals. However, in the animals with evidence of injury 86, 7, 159, and 37 miRNA were differentially expressed in the heart, liver, kidney, or lung, respectively. The majority of the differentially expressed miRNA were tissue specific (Fig.\u00a01). The greatest overlap, with 21 shared modulated miRNA, was between the lung and heart of the injured animals. Only five total miRNA were shared by more than two conditions with four shared between the lung, heart, and kidney of the injured animals and one shared by the liver, heart, and kidney of the injured animals. Interestingly, three of the miRNA shared between the lung, heart, and kidney of the injured animals (rno-miR-22, rno-miR-22-3p, and rno-miR-378a-3p) were down-regulated in the heart, but upregulated in the kidney and lung. The pattern continues with the miRNA differentially expressed in both the heart and lung of the injured animals. Of the 25 shared miRNA, 18 were regulated in the opposite direction, with all of them down-regulated in the heart, and up-regulated in the lung in the injured animals (Fig.\u00a02).Table 1\nNumber of differentially expressed miRNA per condition\n\nDifferentially expressed miRNA were identified in the liver, kidney, lung, and heart of heat stressed animals at 3 time points. A cohort of animals with histopathological evidence of injury at 48\u2009h were analyzed separately from those with no evidence of injury\n\n\nFig. 1\nDifferentially expressed miRNA are mostly time and tissue specific. The bar chart represents the number of differentially expressed miRNA in each of the data sets indicated by a filled dot below. If the miRNA is modulated in more than one time point or tissue, multiple dots are darkened and connected by a line. The set size indicates the total number of differentially expressed miRNA at each tissue/time point\n\n\nFig. 2\nmiRNA differentially expressed in multiple tissues. Three of the miRNA differentially expressed in the lung, heart, and kidney of the injured animals (rno-miR-22, rno-miR-22-3p, and rno-miR-378a-3p) were down-regulated in the heart, but upregulated in the kidney and lung. This is also seen with the miRNA differentially expressed in both the heart and lung. Of the 25 shared miRNA, 15 were regulated in the opposite direction, with all of them down-regulated in the heart, and up-regulated in the lung. The color of the hierarchical clustering shows the log2 fold change\nTo further understand the biological implications of the differentially expressed miRNA, we conducted an unsupervised pathway enrichment. We first identified the mRNA targets that were changing by at least 1.5 fold in the opposite direction of the perturbed miRNA (Additional\u00a0File\u00a03) from our previous work [15]. The pathway analysis was then conducted using the union of all mRNA targets of one condition. We identified 93, 1, 19, 3 and 8 significantly enriched KEGG pathways in the heart of the injured animals, liver at Tc,Max, kidney of the injured animals, lung at Tc,Max, and the lung of the injured animals, respectively (Table\u00a02 and Additional\u00a0File\u00a04). No enriched pathways were common to all conditions. One enriched pathway, the p53 signaling pathway, was enriched in the all tissues of the injured animals suggesting a shared response to heat injury.Table 2\nSelected enriched KEGG pathways\n\nThe top ten and selected enriched KEGG pathways for each condition are shown with p-values and adjusted p-values. The number of genes listed are unique genes that are targets of the differentially expressed miRNA in that condition and contribute to the enrichment of the pathway. The complete list of enriched pathways are listed in Additional File 4\nmiR-21 was identified as one of the most differentially expressed miRNA in the cardiac-injured animals and was also modulated in the lung and kidney of the injured animals. To further explore the role that miR-21 plays in the heat stress response, we manipulated the levels of miR-21 in an in vitro cell model. We hypothesized that increasing the expression level of miR-21 plays a protective role against heat stress, whereas decreasing the expression is detrimental. Therefore, we transfected H9c2 cells with either a miR-21 mimic or a miR-21 inhibitor and measured apoptosis induced by heat stress. Modulated expression of miR-21 significantly affected apoptosis in response to heat stress at 5\u2009h after heating, in which apoptosis increased from 70.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8% to 84.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2% (p\u00a0<\u20090.05) (Fig.\u00a03).\n\nFig. 3\nEffect of miR-21 expression on apoptosis. The y-axis shows the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis. No protective effect of miR-21 against heat induced apoptosis was observed at any time point in H9c2 cells which over expressed miR-21. However, a significant increase in apoptosis in cells with decreased miR-21 expression compared to the transfection control was observed at 5\u2009h, further suggesting that miR-21 plays a critical role in the heat stress response\nThe differentially expressed miRNA support the histopathologic analysis indicating that kidney injury occurred in heat injured animals. miR-21, miR-20a, miR-199a-3p, and miR-194 have all been shown to be modulated in a mouse model of acute kidney injury [39]. In the study conducted by Godwin and colleagues, miR-21 and miR-20a were rapidly up-regulated, miR-199a-3p was up-regulated 3\u2009days post-stress and continued to increase for the duration of the time course of 30\u2009days, whereas miR-194 was rapidly down-regulated [39]. In our data, both rno-miR-21 and rno-miR-20a are also upregulated in the kidney of the injured animals. Rno-miR-21 is also up-regulated in the heart and lung of the injured animals, while rno-miR-20a is also up-regulated in the heart of the injured animals. As in the Godwin study, rno-miR-194-3p and rno-miR-194-5p are down-regulated in the kidney of the injured animals. Interestingly, rno-miR-199a-3p and rno-miR-199a-5p are down-regulated in the kidney of the injured animals, matching Godwin\u2019s results, yet they are up-regulated in the liver of the injured animals. A review conducted in 2016 identified miRNA which were modulated in acute kidney injury among published studies [40]. Twenty-five of the differentially expressed miRNA in the kidney of the animals with injury were also identified in this review as potential biomarkers of acute kidney injury (Table\u00a03). Even though there is a conflict in the direction of change in some of the miRNA compared with other studies, they may align more closely at later or different time points. Nevertheless, these differentially expressed miRNA may serve as indicators of organ injury.Table 3\nMarkers of kidney injury\n\nTwenty-five of the differentially expressed miRNA in the kidney of the animals with injury have been previously identified in other studies as markers of kidney injury\n\n\nAdditional file 1:\nTable of histopathology findings.

Milk fatty acid (FA) traits are scarcely recorded due to expensive and time-consuming analytical techniques. Combining multi-population datasets can enhance the power of GWAS enabling detection of genomic region explaining medium to low proportions of the genetic variation. GWAS often detect broader genomic regions containing several positional candidate genes making it difficult to untangle the causative candidates. Post-GWAS analyses with data on pathways, ontology and tissue-specific gene expression status might allow prioritization among positional candidate genes.Multi-population GWAS for 16 FA traits quantified using gas chromatography (GC) in sample populations of the Chinese, Danish and Dutch Holstein with high-density (HD) genotypes detects 56 genomic regions significantly associated to at least one of the studied FAs; some of which have not been previously reported. Pathways and gene ontology (GO) analyses suggest promising candidate genes on the novel regions including OSBPL6 and AGPS on Bos taurus autosome (BTA) 2, PRLH on BTA 3, SLC51B on BTA 10, ABCG5/8 on BTA 11 and ALG5 on BTA 12. Novel genes in previously known regions, such as FABP4 on BTA 14, APOA1/5/7 on BTA 15 and MGST2 on BTA 17, are also linked to important FA metabolic processes.Integration of multi-population GWAS and enrichment analyses enabled detection of several novel genomic regions, explaining relatively smaller fractions of the genetic variation, and revealed highly likely candidate genes underlying the effects. Detection of such regions and candidate genes will be crucial in understanding the complex genetic control of FA metabolism. The findings can also be used to augment genomic prediction models with regions collectively capturing most of the genetic variation in the milk FA traits.Several fatty acids (FAs) of varying carbon chain length (C4-C22) and degree of saturation are present in milk. FAs in milk can originate either through direct transport from the rumen to the mammary gland via the blood, or from de novo synthesis in the mammary gland from acetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate [1] and propionate [2, 3]. Additionally, FAs in the mammary gland can originate from mobilization of body fat reserves. The short and intermediate chain FAs are mostly synthesized de novo in the mammary gland with the exception of C16:0, of which approximately 50% is assumed to be synthesized de novo. The long chain FAs, and approximately 50% of C16:0, are suggested to be derived from blood lipids originating from the diet [4] and mobilization of body fat reserves [1]. Considerable genetic variation has been reported for the fat composition of milk [5, 6]. Part of this genetic variation is attributed to polymorphisms in genes with major effects such as DGAT1 and SCD1 [7]. In addition, several regions on the bovine genome with suggestive effects on milk fat composition have been reported from GWAS [8\u201310]. Identified genes and genomic regions explain a fraction of 3.6 to 53% of the total genetic variation in different milk FA traits [8, 11]. Detection of additional genomic regions requires availability of larger sample size and high-density markers. GC analysis, the current method of choice to quantify milk FA, requires expensive equipment and is time-consuming, thus limiting measurement of the traits to experimental scale.GWAS for the milk FA traits so far relied on such smaller datasets within different dairy cattle breeds/populations. An option to deal with the limitation in sample size could be to combine the available smaller datasets across populations for joint GWAS. Such analyses can increase detection power depending on the genetic distance between the populations and the marker density [12]. In this study, we undertake multi-population GWAS for milk FA traits by combining samples from Chinese, Danish and Dutch Holstein Friesians with HD genotypes available. Previous studies show high consistency in the linkage disequilibrium (LD) and minor allele frequencies between the populations [13, 14]. Thus, combining samples from these populations for joint GWAS might allow identification of genomic regions explaining even small proportions of the genetic variation in milk FA traits.A hurdle is that due to the long range of LD in livestock breeds, GWAS often result in detection of large genomic regions [15] containing several positional candidate genes. Identifying the actual causative variants, therefore, requires additional evidence on top of the GWAS. Enrichment analysis is commonly undertaken in GWAS to prioritize positional candidate genes linked to significantly enriched pathways and gene ontology (GO) terms that are believed to be relevant to traits of interest. However, FA synthesis can take place in various mammalian tissues and thus further evidence is needed to determine whether such prioritized genes are relevant particularly to milk FA related mechanisms. Studies have been profiling differential expression of genes in the mammary tissues in various species [16, 17]. Information on expression status of genes in the mammary tissues can been used to further prioritize candidate genes linked to FA related pathways. Furthermore, the mammalian phenotype ontology [18], which provides annotation of mammalian phenotypes in the context of mutations, is increasingly becoming useful in fine-tuning the link between detected genes and phenotypes associated [19].In this study, we implement GWAS for milk FA composition using multi-population dataset. Furthermore, we undertake post-GWAS analyses to identify, prioritize and functionally annotate genes within detected genomic regions using multiple information sources including Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, mammary gland gene expression status and information in the mammalian phenotype ontology database [18].Strongest association for C10:0 (\u2212log10 p-value\u2009=\u200924.3), C12:0 (\u2212log10 p-value\u2009=\u200922) and C14:0 (24.2) was detected with two variants on BTA 19 (BovineHD1900014372 and BovineHD1900014348). Significant associations were also detected for C8:0, C16:0, C18:1c9, C14 index and C18 index with SNPs located between 37.3 to 61.3 Mbp on chromosome 19. Particularly for C14:0, 22.3% of the genetic variation was explained by the lead SNP in this region.The strongest association for C14:1 (\u2212log10 p-value\u2009=\u200998.8), C14 index (\u2212log10 p-value\u2009=\u2009126) and C16 index (\u2212log10 p-value\u2009=\u200939.8) was found with SNPs on chromosome 26 (BovineHD2600005461). Significant associations were also detected for C8:0, C10:0, C12:0, C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:0 and C18 index. The lead SNP in this region explained 39.0% of the genetic variation in C14:1.Effects of lead SNPs in all the detected genomic regions are presented in Additional\u00a0file\u00a01. In general for most of the regions, directions of effects were opposite for the de novo synthesized FAs versus the long chain FAs.Among the enriched GO terms and pathways were biosynthesis related, such as \u2018GO:0006633~FA biosynthetic process\u2019, binding and transport related, such as \u2018GO:0008289~lipid binding\u2019 and \u2018GO:0010876~lipid localization\u2019, and metabolism, such as \u2018GO:0006631~FA metabolic process\u2019 and \u2018bta00564:Glycerophospholipid metabolism\u2019.Some among the set of genes in all significantly enriched pathways and GO terms (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02) were also found to be expressed in mammary tissues and epithelial cells across different species. Furthermore, some of the prioritized candidate genes were linked to abnormalities related to FA metabolism in the mammalian phenotype database including \u2018increased circulating triglyceride levels\u2019 (MP:0001552), \u2018abnormal lipid homeostasis\u2019 (MP:0002118) and \u2018abnormal phospholipid level\u2019 (MP:0004777).Apart from genes, also non-coding genomic features such as micro RNAs were located within the detected genomic regions as presented on Additional\u00a0file\u00a03.Our multi-population GWAS resulted in detection of large numbers of genomic regions significantly associated with at least one of the 16 milk FA traits studied, indicating the complexity of the milk FA synthesis pathways. Most of the detected genomic regions have been previously reported in connection to milk FA traits, e.g. genomic regions on BTA 14, BTA 19 and BTA 26 [8, 10, 20].On BTA 14, our analysis indicates three distinct regions significantly associated with several FA traits. The first region is known to contain the DGAT1 gene, of which the effects are well established for multiple FA traits [21, 22]. The second region was previously reported to show significant associations with milk fat percentage [23]. The boundaries of these two regions (14a and 14b) are in close proximity of each other (1.5\u20135 Mbp and 5.2\u201320 Mbp) and the regions appear to be highly correlated in terms of associated FA traits and proportions of genetic variance explained for these traits. While our analysis indicates two distinctive regions, Bouwman et al. [8], based on part of the dataset used in our study, reported a single, broader region (0.0\u201326.3 Mbp) with significant associations to several FA traits. Our hypothesis is that different quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlie these two regions (14a and 14b) but that estimated effects of the QTLs could be confounded, because the high LD at the start of BTA 14 [24] makes it difficult to disentangle the effects of multiple QTL.The third region on BTA 14 (44.7\u201349.9 Mbp) was exclusively associated with C14:1 and C16:1 as well as C14 index and C18 index. This region was previously reported for significant associations with C16:1 [8] and milk fat percentage [25]. The region contains the fatty acid binding proteins FABP4, FABP9 and FABP12 as well as the peripheral myelin protein (PMP2), enriching the GO terms of FA metabolic process (GO:0006631) and lipid binding activities (GO:0008289). A study by Nafikov et al. [26] reported a FABP4 haplotype negatively associated with saturated milk FAs and the ratio between saturated and unsaturated FAs while having positive effects on the unsaturated FAs. Marchitelli et al. [27] also reported that the FABP4 affected the ratio of monounsaturated/saturated FA in milk. Additionally, variation in FABP4 is reported to affect other milk production traits such as milk yield [28]. Therefore, results of our analysis and previous studies suggest a role of this region in desaturation of C14:0, C16:0 and C18:0 with the FABP4 as the most likely candidate gene.Broader regions were detected on BTA 19 (37.3\u201361.3 Mbp) and BTA 26 (2.9\u201343.0 Mbp). The genes FASN on BTA 19 [29] and SCD1 on BTA 26 [30] have previously been suggested as the likely candidate genes for FA traits. However, our enrichment analysis indicate additional genes in these regions connected to important FA metabolism processes including the ACLY, STAT5a, PRKAA1, GH on BTA 19 and ELOVL3, ACLS5 on BTA 26. Significant associations were previously reported between variants within some of these genes and some milk FA traits [11, 31].In our study, more FA traits have been found to have significant associations with the DGAT1 and SCD1 regions than previous GWAS using different parts of the multi-population dataset used in the current analysis [8\u201311, 14]. These previous studies might not be considered as independent of the current analysis; however, more associations in the current analysis can be an indication of improved detection power from combining the populations. This was also demonstrated in our previous study (Submitted) in which results of population-specific analyses versus multi-population joint GWAS were compared. Effects of the DGAT1 (ARS-BFGL-NGS-4939) and SCD1 (BovineHD2600005461) loci were similar in direction and highly correlated between the three populations but estimated effects in the Chinese sample were consistently lower across the FAs compared to the Dutch and Danish Holstein samples.The three regions detected on BTA 5 overlap with previously reported regions for milk FA traits [8, 9, 32]. For region 5c, MGST1 was suggested as the most likely candidate gene [32]. In our analysis, the lead SNP in the region was located within the MGST1 gene. However, our enrichment analysis did not establish any connection to MGST1 with significantly enriched FA related GO terms and pathways. Additionally, PLBD1 and LRP6 genes were connected to several pathways including lipid localization (GO:0010876) and transport (UP_KEYWORDS) suggesting that the significant association observed in the region with 10 FA traits might not be limited to the MGST1 effect.The region on BTA 13 was previously detected in the Dutch Holstein population [8, 11] and in Danish Jersey [9] with both studies suggesting the ACSS2 as the highly likely candidate gene. Meanwhile, using infrared (IR) predicted phenotypes for the de novo FAs, Olsen et al. [33] suggested that the NCOA6, not the ACSS2, is responsible for significant associations in the region. Our enrichment analysis however links ACSS2 with several significantly enriched pathways while no such links were established for the NCOA6 gene.Similarly, the first region on BTA 15 (27.2\u201331.2 Mbp) has been reported in previous studies including a joint Chinese-Danish Holstein population [14]. Several genes enriching FA related pathways were detected in the region including APOA1, APOA4, APOA5, and DPAGT1. The apolipoproteins APOA1/4/5 enriched glycerolipid metabolic process (GO:0046486), fat digestion and absorption (bta04975) as well as negative regulation of FA biosynthetic process (GO:0045717) while the DPGAT1 was involved in lipid biosynthetic process (GO:0008610). The strongest associations observed in the region were between C18.0 and variants within the alipoprotein genes, which showed opposite direction of effects on C10:0 and C14:0. Although effects were not significant, the lead SNP in the region also showed moderate effects on the other de novo FAs including C8:0 (\u2212log 10 p-value\u2009=\u20092.96) and C12:0 (\u2212log 10 p-value\u2009=\u20092.96) with direction of effects similar to C10:0 and C14:0. The alipoproteins APOA1/4/5 are thus collectively suggested as the candidates underlying the strong effect on C18:0 observed in the region. The opposing effects on the de novo FAs might be directly through involvement of the alipoproteins in negative regulation of FA biosynthesis or indirectly through the effect on C18:0, which suppresses de novo synthesis.The two regions detected on BTA 17 are also in agreement with previous findings. The regions detected by Bouwman et al. (2012) [8] (15.0\u201323.9 Mbp) and Li et al., [10] (19.5\u201322.5 Mbp) overlap with the first region (17a) detected in our study. In the region, MGST2 significantly enriched GO terms that included FA metabolic (GO:0006631) and biosynthetic (GO:0006633) processes. The MGST2 is previously linked to intramuscular FA composition in pigs [34] and shown to be expressed in all stages of lactation in humans [17]. Therefore, the MGST2 is suggested as the likely candidate gene underlying effects on the first region of BTA 17. Using a subset of the dataset used in the current study to fine map BTA 17, Duchemin et al. [35] suggested the LARP1B as a primary candidate gene in the second region (17b). However, our enrichment analysis did not result in significant enrichment of any of the FA pathways and ontology terms for genes in the region.Some of the regions detected in our analysis overlap with results from some of the recently published GWAS that are based on IR predicted FA phenotypes [33, 36]. Interestingly, some of the well-established genomic regions in connection to GC-based FA traits, which were also detected in our analysis, have not been found to have significant associations with any of the milk FA phenotypes in these studies. For instance, GWAS by Olsen et al. [33] and Knutsen et al. [36] using the IR predicted FA phenotypes in Nordic Red cattle did not detect any significant association in the DGAT1 and SCD1 regions. Lack of segregation of the A variant of the DGAT1 K232A polymorphism has been suggested as the potential reason for the lack of association in the DGAT1 region. Additionally, Wang et al. [37] showed that the SCD1 polymorphism did not significantly affect any of the milk IR wavenumbers in samples from the Dutch Holstein population. These findings suggest that IR predicted FA phenotypes are not suitable for GWAS. While some FAs can be accurately predicted based on IR [38], low prediction accuracies [39] and low genetic correlations with GC measured FA [40] have been reported for other FAs. Especially FAs found in low concentrations in milk were shown to have low IR prediction accuracies [41]. Apparently, the power to detect QTL can be severely restricted by the IR prediction accuracy.Of the 56 genomic regions significantly associated with at least one FA trait in this study, regions located on BTA 2, 3 10, 11, 12 and 21 appear to be novel regions that have not been previously connected to milk FA traits. The lead SNPs in these regions explained between 1.4 and 5% of the genetic variation in at least one of the FA traits studied.On the detected novel region of BTA 3, the prolactin releasing hormone (PRLH) was shown to be involved in FA metabolic process (GO:0006631). Mutations on the PRLH gene in mice have been associated with increased circulating triglyceride levels (MP:0001552) and increased total body fat amount (MP:0010024) in the mammalian phenotype database. In mammals, the PRLH gene is known to stimulate prolactin release and regulate its expression. Prolactin, which is a polypeptide hormone, has been shown to induce lipogenesis in many tissues [45] and stimulate the expression of genes involved in milk protein synthesis and lipid metabolism [46\u201348]. Moreover, prolactin has been shown to have a wide-range of effects on lactation including growth and development of the mammary gland, promotion of milk synthesis and maintenance of milk secretion [49\u201351]. Therefore, the PRLH gene, through regulation of prolactin release might have effects on milk yield. The pattern of SNP effects in the region suggest a connection with the poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) with strongest associations observed for C18:3n3 and CLA. The direction of effects of the lead SNP was similar for all unsaturated FAs as well as all the desaturation indexes, while opposing effects were estimated for the de novo synthesized FAs and C16:0 (Fig. 5b). C16:0 is shown to have strong negative genetic correlation with milk yield, while moderate positive correlations were reported for the PUFAs [5]. Therefore, the PRLH is suggested as the candidate gene in the region; the effect of which might be indirect through its effect on milk yield, affecting the concentration of the PUFAs and C16:0.The second region on BTA 10 contains the solute carrier family 51-beta subunit (SLC51B) genewhich is implicated in lipid transport (UP_KEYWORDS) and localization (GO:0010876) processes. Pattern of effects in the region show strong effect on C14:1 and moderate effects on with C14 index (\u2212log 10 p-value\u2009=\u20094.5) and C18 index (\u2212log 10 p-value\u2009=\u20093.6) in direction opposite to the strong effect on C18:0 (Fig. 5c). This pattern suggests a reduction in desaturation when C18:0 increases. C18:0 in milk is largely derived via direct transport through the blood from the rumen where is it formed from bio-hydrogenation of dietary C18:2n6 and C18:3n3. Therefore, the effect of SLC51B is highly likely through its involvement in the FA transport processes. Dietary poly-unsaturated FAs, such as C18:2n6, are known to suppress SCD1 activity, thereby reducing its desaturation activity [52]. Thus, we hypothesize that SLC51B underlies the effect on C18:0, while observed opposite effects on the unsaturated FAs and desaturation indexes are rather due to the correlation in C18:0 in milk and dietary PUFA, which suppress desaturation.Among the genes located in the first region of BTA 11, the ATP binding cassette subfamily G5 (ABCG5) and ABCG8 enriched several pathways and processes including fat digestion and absorption pathway (KEGG ~bta04975) and the GO terms of lipid localization (GO:0010876) and transport. In the mammalian phenotype database, the ABCG5 and ABCG8 genes are linked to increased circulating triglyceride level (MP:0001552), abnormal lipid homeostasis (MP:0002118) and abnormal phospholipid level (MP:0004777). In humans, mutations in ABCG5/8 have been linked to conditions characterized by abnormal accumulation of sterols in blood and tissues [53, 54] implicating them in lipid absorption and transport. The KEGG pathway for fat digestion and absorption involves absorption of lipid from the rumen to the blood stream and from the blood stream to the mammary gland. Viturro et al. [55] previously reported high expression levels of both ABCG5 and ABCG8 genes in bovine liver, mammary gland, digestive tract and blood samples. Expression of ABCG5/8 in bovine mammary gland might indicate that apart from absorption and transport of lipids from the digestive tract, ABCG5/8 might also be involved in the secretion of lipids from the mammary gland into the milk. Significant association in the region was limited to C16:0. Although not significant, this region was also associated with C16:1 (\u2212log 10-pvalue\u2009=\u20093.8) and CLA (\u2212log 10-pvalue\u2009=\u20092.2), with directions of effects on CLA opposite to the effects on C16:0, C16:1, and C16 index (Fig. 5d). The GO term of lipid localization and association almost exclusively with C16:0, which is one of the FAs that is highly mobilized from body reserves during negative energy balance, might also indicate a role in the mechanism of body fat reserve mobilization.The dolichyl-phosphate beta glucosyltransferase (ALG5) gene located on the second region of BTA 12 was shown to enrich the lipid biosynthesis process (GO:0008610) and glycerolipid metabolic process (GO:0046486). The ALG5 gene has previously been shown to be differentially expressed during the different stages of lactation in bovine [16] and human [17]. Significant effects in the region were limited to C14:1. The lead SNP also showed moderate effect on C14 index (\u2212log 10 p-value\u2009=\u20093.07) and C18:0 (\u2212log 10 p-value\u2009=\u20093.43) where opposite direction of effects were observed for C18:0 (Fig. 5e). Therefore, the ALG5 is suggested as promising candidate for further characterization for potential role in desaturation process.Significant associations were detected on BTA 21 with C10:0, C12:0, C14:0 and C18:1c9. Effects estimated for the lead SNP in the region were generally opposing directions for the de novo synthesized FAs and C16:0 versus for the long-chain FAs and desaturation indexes (Fig. 5f). Significant associations have previously been reported in the region with milk and milk protein yield [56] as well as fertility traits in cows [57]. However, our enrichment analysis show no gene implicated in the significantly enriched pathways and Go terms. Despite lack of genes implicated on FA related pathways, moderate effects observed for multiple traits in the region are of particular interest. QTL detected through GWAS might be located in non-coding regions. Such QTLs might be involved in regulation of expression of other genes affecting the traits of interest. Therefore, the region might be of interest for eQTL based GWAS in milk FA traits.Apart from coding genes, retrieved genes from the detected regions included regulatory elements, most commonly microRNAs (miRNAs). MiRNAs are small RNAs that regulate the expression of complementary messenger RNAs [58]. Several studies have reported possible roles of miRNAs in lipid and fatty acid metabolisms and in mammary gland development and lactation in several species [59\u201361]. Some of the miRNAs in the detected genomic regions in our study were previously linked to regulatory roles on genes related to FA metabolism and synthesis. Of these, bta-mir-27b, on BTA 8 (region 8b) was shown to target known FA synthesis genes such as FASN and SCD1 [62] as well as mRNAs involved in lipid metabolism [63] and shown to be highly expressed during different stages of bovine lactation [64]. Among the genes located on BTA 2 (region 2d), the bta-mir-26b was shown to be expressed in bovine milk cells and mammary gland [60]. Wang et al., [61] showed that downregulation of miR-26a/b and their host genes decreased the expression of genes related to fatty acid synthesis, including DGAT1 and SCD1.Multi-population GWAS for GC-quantified FA traits resulted in the detection of 56 genomic regions significantly associated to at least one of the studied FAs, including novel regions explaining relatively smaller fractions of the genetic variation. Enrichment analysis of genes harbored in detected regions reveals promising candidate genes some of which have not been previously linked to milk FA traits, including OSBPL6 and AGPS on BTA 2, PRLH on BTA 3, SLC51B on BTA 10, ABCG5/8 on BTA 11 and ALG5 on BTA 12. Post-GWAS analyses using multiple data sources on pathways, ontology terms and tissue-specific gene expression status enabled prioritization of highly likely causative candidate genes among several positional candidates on detected regions. Use of such data in combination in combination with analysis of patterns of effects across the milk FA spectrum allowed linking some of the candidates to specific FA synthesis mechanisms. Detection of several novel regions and candidate genes will be contribute to the knowledge base on genetics underlying the bovine milk FA composition.Test-day milk samples were obtained from 784 Chinese, 675 Danish and 1566 Dutch Holstein cows sampled from 18 herds in China, 22 herds across Denmark and 398 herds in the Netherlands. Stages of lactation of sampled cows ranged from 3 to 700\u2009days in milk in the Chinese population, 9 to 481\u2009days in milk in the Danish population and 60 to 278\u2009days in milk in the Dutch Holstein cows. To standardize the samples from the three countries, only cows at days-in-milk of 60 and above were considered for the multi-population GWAS. Thus, 700 Chinese, 614 Danish and 1566 Dutch samples were available for the analysis. The reason to standardize the dataset by lactation stage is that the genetic determination of milk fat composition traits might be different in the early stages of lactation. There is evidence that effects of genes in early lactation differ from those later in lactation [65]. Excluding early lactation records can help eliminate this heterogeneity issue.FA traits, including C8:0, C10:0, C12:0, C14:0, C14:1, C15:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:0, C18:1c9, C18:2n6, C18:3n3 and C18:2 cis-9,trans-11 (CLA), were analyzed using the GC method. Details of the sample preparation for the GC analyses are as described by Li et al. [10] for Chinese samples, Poulsen et al. [66] for Danish samples and Stoop et al. [5] for Dutch samples. Genomic regions affecting the saturated FAs might show association to the unsaturated forms because the saturated form available for desaturation determines proportion of the unsaturated FAs. Hence, calculation of the desaturation indexes might allow detection of regions particularly associated with the desaturation process. Accordingly, desaturation indexes were calculated based on the FA measurements as: C14 index\u2009=\u2009C14:1/(C14:1\u2009+\u2009C14:0) * 100; C16 index\u2009=\u2009C16:1/(C16:1\u2009+\u2009C16:0) * 100 and C18 index\u2009=\u2009C18:1c9/ (C18:1c9\u2009+\u2009C18:0) * 100.High-density (HD) genotypes, real or imputed, were available for all cows used in the analyses. All cows in the Chinese dataset were initially genotyped using the BovineSNP50 Beadchip (50\u2009K, Illumina). A sample population of 96 Chinese Holstein bulls, genotyped using the BovineHD Beadchip (777\u2009K), was available as reference to impute the 50\u2009K genotypes of the cows to HD.Part of the Danish cows were genotyped using the BovineSNP50 Beadchip, while the remaining Danish cows were genotyped using the BovineHD Beadchip and used as reference to impute the 50\u2009K genotypes of the first part of the Danish cows to HD as described in Gebreyesus et al. [67]. The Dutch cows were genotyped with a custom 50\u2009K SNP Beadchip and subsequently imputed to HD as presented in detail in Duchemin et al. [68]. SNPs with minor allele frequencies (MAF) less than 0.05 or with a count of one of the genotypes less than 10 in each population were excluded from the association analysis. A total of 464,130 SNPs were available for the association analysis. The SNP positions were based on the bovine genome assembly UMD 3.1 [69].Where yijkl is the phenotype of cow l; \u03bc is the fixed effect of mean; parityi and herdj are the fixed effects of parity and herd, respectively; b1 is the regression coefficient for DIM, DIMijkl is a covariate of days in milk; b2 is the allele substitution effect for SNP, SNPk is a covariate indicating the number of copies of a specific allele (0, 1 or 2) of the SNP; and animal is the random additive genetic effect. Animal effects were assumed to be distributed as \\( \\mathrm{N}\\left(0,\\mathbf{G}{\\sigma}_a^2\\right), \\) where G is the genomic relationship matrix constructed using all HD genotypes but excluding the SNPs on the chromosome on which SNP k is located. Residuals were assumed to be distributed as: \\( \\mathrm{N}\\left(0,\\mathbf{I}{\\sigma}_e^2\\right), \\) where I is the identity matrix. Since only cows with more than 60\u2009days-in-milk were included in the analyses, a linear adjustment for DIM was sufficient. For the FA traits C18:2n6, C18:3n3 and CLA, log transformation was applied prior to the association analysis to account for observed heterogeneity of residual variances.Significance thresholds were determined using a false discovery rate (FDR). Significance thresholds corresponding to FDR of 5% ranged for different FA from \u2013log10 p-value\u2009=\u20093.4 to \u2013log10 p-value\u2009=\u20095.0. We used a \u2013log10 p-value of 5.0 as the genome-wide significance threshold for all FA composition traits.To determine if a region harbored one or more QTL, iterative approaches fitting the effect of SNPs with the highest \u2013log 10 p-values were employed. In this approach, the SNP with the highest \u2013log 10 p-value for the studied FA trait was considered as the lead SNP. The allelic dosage of such a lead SNP was then fitted as fixed effect for a second round of chromosome-wide analyses. If other SNPs, also significantly associated in the first round GWAS, were still found to have -log 10-pvalue >\u20095 in the second round analysis, the SNP with the highest \u2013log 10 p-value in the second analysis was taken as the second lead SNP and its allelic dosage fitted as fixed effect for a third round of analysis. This procedure was iterated until no further SNP with -log 10-pvalue >\u20095 was observed. The SNPs that showed significant association in a round of GWAS but showed \u2013log 10 p-value <\u20095 upon fitting the allelic dosage of the lead SNP were then considered as part of a region around that lead SNP. The position of the first and last such SNP before and after the lead SNP were considered as the boundaries of the region.Genes found within detected genomic regions were retrieved from the ensemble database using the BioMart web interface based on the UMD 3.1 bovine genome assembly (https://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview). The DAVID functional annotation tool (https://david.ncifcrf.gov) was then used to analyze overrepresented GO biological terms, which included the terms cellular component (CC), molecular function (MF), biological process (BP) and the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways. Ontologies in the mammalian phenotype database were accessed and searched for genes connected to abnormalities relevant to FA metabolism using the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) web platform (http://www.informatics.jax.org/batch).Bos Taurus AutosomeFatty AcidFalse Discovery RateGas ChromatographyGene OntologyGenome-Wide Association StudyHigh-DensityInfraredKyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and GenomesLinkage DisequilibriumPoly-Unsaturated Fatty AcidQuantitative Trait LociSingle Nucleotide PolymorphismThis study was supported by the Center for Genomic Selection in Animals and Plants (GenSAP) funded by the Danish council for strategic research.

The 13 FAs studied together amounted to 87.6% of total fat. Of the studied FAs, C18:3n3 and CLA occurred at concentrations less than 1% of total fat in the milk samples. Other FAs including C15:0, C8:0, C14:1 and C16:1 also occurred at low concentrations of total fat (means\u2009=\u20091.09\u20131.49). Coefficients of variation (not shown) of the FA traits ranged between 0.06% (C18 index) and 0.43% (CLA). Heritability estimates in the studied FA traits ranged from low (0.18) for C18:2n6 to high (0.53) for C14 index. The dataset used in the current study comprises samples from the Chinese, Danish and Dutch Holstein population and details regarding descriptive statistics and genetic parameters within each population can be found in our previous study (Submitted).Table 1\nPhenotypic means (with standard deviations, SD) and genetic parameters (with standard errors, SE) in the combined-population dataset\n\naExpressed in % wt/wt\nbDesaturation indexes calculated as unsaturated/(unsaturated + saturated)\u2009\u00d7\u2009100\nOur multi-population GWAS resulted in the detection of 56 genomic regions containing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with at least one of the studied FA traits (Table\u00a02). Significant associations were detected on all chromosomes except BTA 18. Most of the FA traits showed significant associations with multiple genomic regions on several chromosomes; particularly for C10:0 (14 regions), C16:0 (12 regions), C16:1 (13 regions), C18:1c9 (11 regions) and C16 index (13 regions). Proportions of genetic variance explained by the lead SNPs in the detected regions ranged between 1.4 and 45.3% for the different FA traits studied.Table 2\nGenomic regions associated with milk fatty acid traits in the multi-population analysis and suggested candidate genes\n\naBTA number with subscript of alphabets to denote the multiple regions within a chromosome\nPeak sizes (highest \u2013log 10 p-value) across FA traits ranged from a \u2013log 10 p-value of 6.9 for C18:0 to a \u2013log 10 p-value of 126 for C14 index.

This region (14a) was significantly associated with all studied FA traits except C12:0. The lead SNP in this region explained up to 34% of the genetic variation in C18:1c9 and C18:2n6. Two other regions on BTA 14 remained significantly associated with multiple FA traits after accounting for the fixed effect of the lead SNP from region 14a (ARS-BFGL-NGS-4939). The second region (14b) was also significantly associated with most FA traits except C12:0. The third region on BTA 14 (14c), was significantly associated with C14:1, C16:1, C14 index and C18 index. The lead SNP in this region explained 2.7% of the genetic variation in C18 index and 1.6% in C14 index.\n\nFig. 1\nManhattan plots showing BTAs on the x-axis and -log 10-p values on the y-axis for the de novo synthesized FAs of C8:0 (a), C10:0 (b), C12:0 (c), C14:0(d).

These positional candidate genes were further prioritized using enrichment analyses implemented in the DAVID web platform (https://david.ncifcrf.gov), which resulted in different significantly enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways relevant to FA related mechanisms (Table\u00a03).Table 3\nThe list of enriched FA related pathways and GO terms\nTwo genes retrieved for region 2a enriched GO terms related to fatty acids. The OSBPL6 gene belonging to the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) family, a group of intracellular lipid receptors, is shown to be involved in lipid binding (GO:0008289) and transport (UP_KEYWORDS) processes. The OSBPL6 gene is found to be expressed in the human mammary gland during several stages of lactation [17]. The human OSBPL6 gene is also shown to have a binding site for miR-33a/b [42], which is a microRNA shown to have targeting effects on genes regulating \u03b2-oxidation of FAs [43], leading to significantly lower levels of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate [44]. Another gene located in the region (AGPS) also enriched GO terms related to FA synthesis including lipid biosynthesis process (GO:0008610). In the mammalian phenotype database, mutation in the AGPS gene in mice has been linked to abnormal lipid levels (MP:0001547), which is a rather broad term in the database referring to any anomaly in the concentrations of fat-soluble substances in the body, including circulating triglyceride and free FAs. Thus, our enrichment analysis indicate that both the OSBPL6 and AGPS might have roles on de novo synthesis of FAs. Pattern of SNP effects in the region is also in agreement with enrichment analysis such that strongest association was estimated with C8:0 and C10:0 while moderate, but not significant effect was measured for C12:0 and C14:0 (\u2212log 10 p-value\u2009=\u20094.2). Opposing direction of the lead SNP effect were also observed for the de novo synthesized FAs, except C15:0, on the one hand and most of the long chain FAs on the other (Fig.\u00a05a). Therefore, both the OSBPL6 and AGPS are considered as likely candidates in the region. .\n\nFig. 5\nEffects of lead SNPs on regions 2a (a), 3 (b), 10b (c), 11b (d), 12b (e) and 21 (f) standardized by dividing the SNP effects with standard deviation of the respective FA trait\nA single-SNP association test was implemented using a mixed linear model in the GCTA program [70].

Heritability (h2) estimates were computed as: (2)where \\( {\\sigma}_e^2 \\) is the residual variance.\n\nAdditional file 1:\nEffects of the lead SNPs in all the detected genomic regions.

If the transcriptome size of two cells is different, direct comparison of the expression measurements on the same amount of total RNA for two samples can only identify genes with changes in the relative mRNA abundances, i.e., cellular mRNA concentration, rather than genes with changes in the absolute mRNA abundances.Our recently proposed RankCompV2 algorithm identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) through comparing the relative expression orderings (REOs) of disease samples with that of normal samples. We reasoned that both the mRNA concentration and the absolute abundances of these DEGs must have changes in disease samples. In simulation experiments, this method showed excellent performance for identifying DEGs between normal and disease samples with different transcriptome sizes. Through analyzing data for ten cancer types, we found that a significantly higher proportion of the DEGs with absolute mRNA abundance changes overlapped or directly interacted with known cancer driver genes and anti-cancer drug targets than that of the DEGs only with mRNA concentration changes alone identified by the traditional methods. The DEGs with increased absolute mRNA abundances were enriched in DNA damage-related pathways, while DEGs with decreased absolute mRNA abundances were enriched in immune and metabolism associated pathways.Both the mRNA concentration and the absolute abundances of the DEGs identified through REOs comparison change in disease samples in comparison with normal samples. In cancers these genes might play more important upstream roles in carcinogenesis.It is a common practice to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between two phenotypes through comparing the gene expression profiles measured with the same amount of RNA (or mRNA) extracted from two-phenotype samples, based on the assumption that different types of cells have approximately the same amount of total RNA per cell (transcriptome size) [1]. However, this assumption does not hold under many biological conditions. For example, high expression level of c-Myc can induce global transcriptional amplification of cancer cells [2] and many cancer cells are aneuploid and/or polyploid [3], both of which may cause a change in the transcriptome size [4, 5]. Consequently, if two samples being compared are different in transcriptome sizes but still the same amounts of RNA are used which will result in different numbers of cells between the two measured samples, a direct comparison of the measurement values of the two samples can only identify transcripts with changed cellular concentration which might have no changes in absolute mRNA abundances [6]. Although it could be argued that the concentrations of macromolecules are relevant parameters governing biochemical reactions inside cells, inappropriate interpretation of mRNA concentration changes might lead to incorrect conclusions for a range of biological questions, including the transcriptional characteristics of cancer cells [7].Experimental methods have been proposed to identify genes with differential absolute mRNA abundances between two cells with different transcriptome sizes [1, 7\u20139]. However, none has been commonly accepted as a reliable standard approach. For example, if the number of cells used for RNA extraction can be determined, such as in experiments for cell lines or microdissected solid tumor tissues, external control RNA could be spiked into each RNA sample in proportion to the numbers of cells for data normalization [1]. However, large technical variations in spike-in control enrichment and amplification during library preparation challenge the use of spike-in controls [10, 11]. The biological scaling normalization approach proposed by Aanes et al. [8] for adjusting the variation in transcriptome sizes between samples cannot be employed if the number of cells is unknown, which is often the case in experiments for undissected solid tissues. Besides the above-mentioned difficulties, it must be pointed out that all of these strategies are not useful for previously published data, where none of the information about external RNA controls or the cell numbers could be available.Ranking all genes according to their measured expression levels in a descending (or ascending) order in a sample, the within-sample relative expression ordering (REO) of a gene pair (GA and GB) represents whether the expression level of GA is higher or lower than that of GB in the sample. Previously, we have found that the within-sample REOs of gene pairs are highly stable in a particular type of normal tissues but widely disturbed in tumor tissues. Based on this finding, an algorithm, RankComp [12], was proposed to detect DEGs through analyzing reversal REOs pattern in an individual disease sample, taking the highly stable REOs in normal samples as the background. Recently, we adjusted this algorithm slightly to fit case-control cohort data, named RankCompV2 [13, 14]. The RankComp and RankCompV2 algorithm detect the genes with expression changes that disrupt the gene correlation structures and change the REOs of the gene pairs from one phenotype to the other. Here, we reasoned that DEGs identified through REOs comparison must change in both mRNA concentration and absolute abundances through theoretical reasoning and simulation experiment. Then, RankCompV2 was applied to ten cancer datasets. Finally, we provided preliminary evidence that the DEGs with changes in both absolute mRNA abundances and concentration are more likely to be closely related with cancer driver genes and drug targets than the DEGs which may change only in mRNA concentration exclusively identified by the popular SAM or edgeR algorithm. RankCompV2 is implemented in C language on Linux and is available on GitHub (https://github.com/pathint/reoa).The RankCompV2 algorithm was proposed for identifying DEGs with large expression changes lead REOs within diseased samples reversed, comparing with the stable REOs within the normal samples [13].Similarly, gene pairs with significantly stable REOs in the disease samples are identified. Focusing on the overlaps of the two lists of gene pairs, the gene pairs with stable REOs in the normal samples are defined as the normal background stable REOs while the gene pairs with reversely stable REOs in the disease samples compared with the normal samples are defined as the reversal REOs of the disease group. For a given gene G, we counted the numbers of gene pairs with G\u2009>\u2009Gi and gene pairs with G\u2009<\u2009Gi in normal and disease samples, respectively, and listed the four-cell contingency table through analyzing the G-background REOs and the reversal REOs. Then the Fisher\u2019s exact test is used to test whether gene G expresses differentially in the disease group. After the identification of all candidate DEGs, the gene pairs including candidate DEGs as partner genes are excluded from the construction of the contingency table. And the Fisher\u2019s exact test is performed again to minimize the confound effects of the expression changes of the partner genes. This filtering process is conducted iteratively until the number of DEGs keeps stable in two successive iterations. The details of the RankCompV2 algorithm were described in our previous work [13].RankCompV2 is an empirical algorithm, where the default FDR parameter (FDR\u2009<\u20090.05) for the determination of significantly stable REOs can control false discoveries in simulation experiments, as demonstrated on nine datasets in our previous study [13] and on the twenty datasets in this study (Additional file 1, Additional file 2: Figure S1 and Additional file 3: Table S1).We used the POG (Percentage of Overlapping Genes) score [26] and the concordance score to evaluate the reproducibility of DEGs identified from two independent datasets. If two lists of DEGs with length L1 and L2, have n overlaps, among which s have the same dysregulation directions (up- or down-regulation), then the POG score from list 1 (or 2) to list 2 (or 1), denoted as POG12 (or POG21), is calculated as s/L1 (or s/L2), and the concordance score is calculated as s/n. We evaluated whether a concordance score is higher than what expected by chance using the binomial distribution as described above, where p0 is the probability of a gene having the concordant dysregulation direction in the two lists by chance.The hypergeometric distribution was used to determine the biological pathways significantly enriched with up- and down-regulated DEGs [27], respectively, based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database (downloaded on May 16, 2016) [28].The absolute mRNA abundance of a given gene in a cell is defined as the transcript number of the gene in the cell, and the mRNA concentration is defined as the proportion of mRNA of a given gene in the total mRNA of the cell. Because the mRNA concentration of a gene in a cell is equal to the mRNA concentration of the gene in the corresponding sample including many identical cells, a direct comparison of the measurement values of two samples can identify DEGs with changes in cellular mRNA concentration. However, when the transcriptome size of a tumor cell is different from that of a normal cell, direct comparison of the measurement values of two samples cannot identify genes with changes in absolute mRNA abundances at the single cell level. Here, we reasoned that DEGs identified through REOs comparison must change in both mRNA concentration and absolute abundances at the single cell level.Since S are the same for two samples and rk are comparable between two samples after data normalization, direct comparison of the normalized measurements (Mki) between the two samples is equivalent to the comparison of the concentrations (Cki) between the two samples. Consequently, the DEGs identified by using traditional methods, such as SAM for microarray data or edgeR for RNA-sequencing data, are the genes with changes in mRNA concentration (Cki) between the two samples.Because both Tk and S in eq. (3) are constant for a particular sample k, the within-sample REOs ranked according to the concentration (Cki) are the same with the REOs ranked according to the transcript number (Nki). Therefore, the observed reversal REOs in sample 2 compared with sample 1 must be the reversal REOs of both the mRNA concentration and the transcript number (absolute mRNA abundances). Thus, the DEGs identified by the REO-based RankCompV2 algorithm must have changes in both mRNA concentration and absolute abundances. Consequently, they should be included in the DEGs with concentration changes detected by traditional quantitative-based methods such as SAM or edgeR, given that the later can achieve sufficient power in the data under analysis.We assumed that the number of reads mapping to a transcript sequence is roughly proportional to the RNA amount of the transcript and the sum of the read counts of all transcripts (total mapped reads) was used to represent the total RNA amount of a sample. Thus, we performed a simulation experiment based on the RNA-sequencing data of the GSE87340 dataset to evaluate the performance of RankCompV2 in data with global transcriptome size changes. For the 19,471 genes measured for the 27 normal samples, after removing genes with a count of 0 in more than 75% of the samples, we simulated disease samples by randomly selecting 6000 genes to produce 3000, 4000 and 5000 up-regulated DEGs and correspondingly 3000, 2000 and 1000 down-regulated DEGs, respectively. For each simulation experiment, the up-regulated genes were equally divided into four groups and the fold change (FC) levels of the genes in the four groups were assigned as 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively. Similarly, the down-regulated genes were equally divided into four groups and the FC levels of the genes in the four groups were assigned as 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 and 1/5, respectively.When simulating more up-regulated DEGs than down-regulated DEGs, the simulated disease samples tend to have more total transcript counts than the normal samples, which mean that the transcriptome size of a disease cell is larger than that of a normal cell. In order to simulate the same amount of total RNA extracted from two samples, the read counts of each transcript in simulated disease samples were multiplied by a transcriptome size factor to make the total counts of simulated disease samples keep the same with that of normal samples. The factor is the fold change of the transcriptome size (the amount of total RNA per cell) between the tumor cell and the normal cell.Read counts were used in edgeR and the RPKM values calculated from the counts were used in RankCompV2 to identify DEGs. Each simulation experiment was repeated 100 times. The sensitivity (the ratio of correctly identified DEGs to all true DEGs), the specificity (the ratio of correctly identified non-DEGs to all true non-DEGs), the F-score (a harmonic mean of the sensitivity and the specificity) and the false discovery rate (FDR, the ratio of true non-DEGs to all identified DEGs) were employed to evaluate the performance of different algorithms.As shown in Table 3, the average sensitivity of RankCompV2 was only 56.10% for DEGs with FC of 1.5 and up to 98.84% with FC of 3.5, which suggested that RankCompV2 performed well for DEGs with large expression changes. In general, RankCompV2 showed a very high specificity and a very low FDR when the FC level increased from 1.5 to 3.5. Notably, the FDR of edgeR rises as the FC level increases. The underlying reason is as follows. When up-regulated DEGs with a larger FC level was introduced in the simulation, it leads to a bigger global transcriptome size of a tumor cell than that of a normal cell, as shown by the decreased transcriptome size factor (Table 3), the ratio between the normal transcriptome size and the simulated tumor cell size. The edgeR algorithm identifies DEGs through comparing the read counts of a gene between the two samples. Given the same amount of total input RNA for the two samples, many genes without differences in mRNA absolute abundances would have lower read counts in the tumor sample than in the normal sample, thus be identified as down-regulated genes, which leads to a higher FDR of edgeR if taking DEGs with absolute mRNA abundance changes as the reference.We also performed a simulation experiment on the genome size changes leading to the global transcriptome size variations. The simulation experiment also demonstrated that RankCompV2 could identify genes with expression changes in absolute abundances and performed well for DEGs with large expression changes (Additional file 4).The DEGs identified by RankCompV2 were highly reproducible in independent datasets. For LIHC, RankCompV2 identified 3715 DEGs from the GSE57957 dataset and 51.71% of them were included in the 4728 DEGs detected from the GSE45267 dataset. The concordance score of the overlapped 1946 DEGs was 98.72% which was unlikely to be observed by chance (binomial test, p\u2009<\u20091.0E-16). The highly reproducibility of RankCompV2 DEGs identified from independent datasets were also observed in the other nine cancer types (Fig. 1b).With 116 targets of 148 anti-cancer drugs documented in CancerDR [36], we found that 16.56% of the 6472 absolute DEGs for LIHC overlapped or directly interacted with known anti-cancer drug targets in the STRING network, which was significantly higher than the corresponding ratio 10.91% for the 12,049 relative DEGs (Fisher\u2019s exact test, p\u2009<\u20091.0E-16). Similar results were observed for the remained nine cancer types (Fig. 2c).The down-regulated absolute DEGs were commonly enriched in many metabolism pathways, including amino acid, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and in immune associated pathways, including \u201cchemokine signaling\u201d, \u201ccomplement and coagulation cascades\u201d and \u201cleukocyte transendothelial migration\u201d. In contrast, the down-regulated relative DEGs were enriched in signaling pathways including \u201ccalcium signaling\u201d, \u201ccAMP signaling\u201d, \u201cneuroactive ligand-receptor interaction\u201d and two sensory system pathways of \u201colfactory transduction\u201d and \u201ctaste transduction\u201d. The difference of pathways enriched by two type DEGs is an issue worth further analysis.We demonstrated that the REO-based RankCompV2 algorithm can identify DEGs with changes in both mRNA concentration and absolute abundances (the absolute DEGs), while the quantitative-based algorithms can identify only those with changes in mRNA concentration (the relative DEGs). Through studies for all the ten cancers, the absolute DEGs have a higher probability associated with both known cancer driver genes and drug targets than the relative DEGs. Thus, we speculate that the absolute DEGs might play a more important upstream role in carcinogenesis. In addition pathway enrichment analysis showed that up-regulated absolute DEGs are significantly enriched in DNA damage-related pathways and down-regulated absolute DEGs are significantly enriched in immune and metabolism associated pathways. The genome instability including DNA damages and tumor-promoting inflammation driven by immune cells are two enabling characteristics of tumor and instrumental for tumorigenesis and progression [38], and energy metabolism dysregulation is a fundamental hallmark to fuel cancer cell growth and division [38].The reasoning for that the REOs-based RankCompV2 algorithm can identify DEGs with changes in absolute mRNA abundances is based on the ideal condition that the gene expression measurements are well correlated with the transcript numbers. For tumor tissues, the ideal condition could be violated due to variations of the tumor epithelial cell proportions in tissues sampled from different sites of a tumor and partial RNA degradation during sample preparation. However, the qualitative nature of REOs lends them the advantage being robust against the above-mentioned confounding factors [39\u201341]. As demonstrated in our recent study, the stromal cells in tumor tissues have similar REOs with those of epithelial cells in tumor tissues [39, 41]. More than 96% REOs in the tumor tissues with above 70% of proportion of epithelial cells are consistent with the REOs in tumor epithelial cells, and about 90% REOs in tumor epithelial cells are kept in tumor tissues even when the proportion of epithelial cells decreases to 30% [41]. Therefore, the REOs-based RankCompV2 algorithm would be largely applicable to real tumor data of macro-dissected cancer tissues.In order to simplify the reasoning, we assumed that genes have similar measurement biases and the correlation coefficients (r) between the measured expression values and the transcript numbers are similar for different genes in eq. (3). However, different measurement biases exist among different samples and among different genes within samples in actual measurement [42\u201344]. Thus, it seems unreasonable to compare the measured expression levels of different genes within a sample. However, it has been shown that the within-sample REOs are robust against systematic biases of measurements, experimental batch effects and data normalization [45]. Moreover, the gene pairs with large rank difference tend to retain the same REO patterns in samples measured with different platforms [46]. The high robustness of within-sample REOs indicate that the influence of measurement biases on the REOs is small.Here, we further analyzed the influence of measurement biases on the within-sample REO-based algorithm. Considering two genes, i and j which have the expression levels Ei and Ej, respectively, their measured values can be written as Mi\u2009=\u2009Eiri and Mj\u2009=\u2009Ejrj. The ordering between the two measured values can be judged by the ratio of Mi/Mj\u2009=\u2009(ri/rj) (Ei/Ej). If there is no bias, ri\u2009=\u2009rj, then Mi/Mj will be the same as Ei/Ej. If ri and rj are not the same but remain constant in the measurement range, Mi/Mj is proportional to the ground truth ratio, therefore the observed REOs may not reflect the true REOs, which will reduce the statistical power of the RankCompV2 algorithm but will not introduce false discoveries (Additional file 7). Furthermore, if the bias is not systematic, the misjudged REOs will distribute randomly in the four cells of the contingency table of the counts of numbers of gene pairs with Mi\u2009>\u2009Mj or Mi\u2009<\u2009Mj. Therefore, the detection power is expected to be reduced. If the dynamic range is not linear, the situation will be more complicated. But we also expect that the main influence to our method is to reduce the detection power slightly. It means that the RankCompV2 algorithm can detect at least a part of the DEGs with absolute mRNA abundances changes, which still have biological significances. We believe that the power of the RankCompV2 algorithm will increase along with the improvement of gene expression measurement technologies.Genomic copy number aberrations (CNAs) could also account for a substantial portion of gene expression changes. Currently, CNAs in cancer genomes are determined by comparing the measurements for the same amounts of DNA extracted from cancer and normal tissues, based on the assumption that the overall yields of DNA per cell (genome sizes) of different cell types are approximately the same. However, this assumption is least likely to hold because many cancers are aneuploid and/or polyploid [3]. The wrong assumption might lead to a serious consequence because CNAs are often used to determine cancer driver genes [47, 48]. Although several methods such as FREEC [49] and CNAnorm [50] have been proposed to correct the issues associated with cancer genome sizes in estimating copy number alterations based on deep sequencing data, there still exist some limitations. For example, FREEC cannot deal with patients\u2019 tumor samples due to the need of providing the ploidy of the most abundant copy number; CNAnorm is based on the assumption that tumor cells are largely monoclonal or polyclonal in a similar way, which could produce misleading results in tumors with large clonal variations [49, 50]. Furthermore, these methods cannot analyze the vast amount of microarray CNA data. The REOs comparison algorithm cannot be used to detect CNAs because, theoretically, the DNA intensity signals in normal cells should be equal. Due to the same problem of cancer cell aneuploid and/or polyploid [3], DNA methylation analyses using bisulfite-Seq data based on the same amount of DNA are also problematic [9]. Notably, the average beta value of a given locus measured by the Illumina bead-array can be interpreted as an estimate on the proportion of methylated cells to all measured cells [51\u201353]. Thus, when comparing two samples with different average DNA yields per cell, the differentially methylated loci will not be affected when similar amounts of DNA are extracted from different number of cells.The RankCompV2 algorithm can only identify DEGs with sufficiently large expression changes that widely change the REOs of the genes from one phenotype to the other. On one hand, such DEGs might be of special biological significance, because functionally related genes tend to express coordinately in a stable state of physiological or pathological condition [54]. On the other hand, many genes with small absolute abundance changes would be determined as relative DEGs, which would blur the differences between the absolute DEGs and the relative DEGs. To learn more about the DEGs with changes in absolute mRNA abundances, it needs to develop new biological techniques and/or bioinformatics algorithms. Finally, we note that the studies on expression comparisons of microRNA and long non-coding RNA between two phenotypes are also based on the wrong assumption of similar overall yields of RNA molecules among different cells [9, 55], where the REO-based methods are applicable [56, 57]. It would be also interesting to study whether these RNA molecules with absolute abundances changes might have specific biological significances.REO-based algorithm identified DEGs with changes in both mRNA concentration and absolute abundances. Through studies for all the ten cancers, we found DEGs with absolute mRNA abundance changes are more likely to be closely related with cancer driver genes and drug targets and enriched in DNA damage, metabolism and immune associated pathways.

For microarray and beadchip datasets, quantile normalized values were used in both SAM [15] and RankCompV2. For the RNAseq data, edgeR uses raw counts as input to identify DEGs [16]. When applying the edgeR package, we employed the default TMM (trimmed mean of M-values) [17] to normalize the raw count for sequencing depth and RNA composition. Because TMM does not deal with the transcript length bias of sequencing data, the data normalized with this algorithm are not suitable to rank expression levels of genes with different transcript lengths. Thus, RankCompV2 uses log2 RPKM data where the transcript length bias has been normalized, as input to identify DEGs. See supplementary method for details (Additional file 1).Table 1\nTwenty datasets for ten cancers analyzed in this study\n\nAbbreviation: LIHC Liver hepatocellular carcinoma, KIRC Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, HNSC Head and Neck squamous cell carcinoma, LUSC Lung squamous cell carcinoma, STAD Stomach adenocarcinoma, COAD Colon adenocarcinoma, LUAD Lung adenocarcinoma, BRCA Breast invasive carcinoma, PAAD Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, ESCA Esophageal carcinoma\nFirst, gene pairs with significantly stable REOs are identified in the normal samples. Stable gene pairs, defined as gene pairs with identical REO pattern in significantly more samples for one phenotype than expected by chance, were identified by a binomial test. For a given gene pair (Gi, Gj), let s denote the number of samples in which gene i has a higher (or lower) expression level than gene j in a total of n samples, the significance of the REO pattern is determined by a binomial test as follows, (1)where p0 is the probability of observing a certain REO pattern (Gi\u2009>\u2009Gj or Gi\u2009<\u2009Gj) in a sample by chance (p0\u2009=\u20090.5). Current approaches for adjusting the p-values in discrete statistics are still arguable [18\u201323]. Here, we used the Benjamini and Hochberg method [24] for this purpose, though the method tends to have insufficient power for discrete data [25].Let Tk represent the amount of total mRNA in a cell of sample k (k\u2009=\u20091, 2) and S represent the same amount of total mRNA extracted from the two samples. Then the number of cells in sample k can be represented as (2)Under the ideal condition that mRNA is extracted from the pure normal epithelial cells (sample 1) and pure tumor epithelial cells (sample 2), the measured expression level of gene i in sample k is, (3)where rk is the linear correlation coefficient between the measured expression value and the transcript number of gene i in sample k with nk cells, Nki represent the transcript number of gene i (i\u2009=\u20091,...,m) in a cell of sample k. Cki\u2009=\u2009Nki/Tk is proportional to the cellular concentration of the transcript of gene i in sample k. Here, we assume that the normalized count values of RNA-sequencing platforms and the fluorescence intensity values of microarray platforms are approximately linearly correlated with the transcript number in a sample within a certain range of gene expression level [29\u201332].As shown in Table\u00a02, when the number of up-regulated DEGs increased from 3000 to 5000, the ratio of the total counts of the normal sample to that of the simulated disease samples decreased from 0.7570 to 0.5972. The TMM normalization [17] can estimate a scale factor to adjust the different total RNA output between samples. When the numbers of up- and down-regulated DEGs were equal, edgeR which can incorporate these factors into DEGs analysis exhibited higher average sensitivity and F-score than RankCompV2. However, the FDR of edgeR was up to 54.89% when the up-regulated DEGs were more than the down-regulated DEGs. Instead, RankCompV2 exhibited rather good performance with sensitivity >\u200995%, specificity >\u200999% and FDR\u2009<\u20090.15%. For each simulation experiment the DEGs identified by RankCompV2 were completely included in the DEGs identified by edgeR. The simulation results confirmed the above mathematical reasoning and demonstrated RankCompV2 can identify genes with expression change in both mRNA concentration and absolute abundances.Table 2\nSimulation evaluation with different transcriptome sizes for edgeR and RankCompV2\n\nNote: Up (or Down) indexes the number of simulated up-regulated (or down-regulated) DEGs; Factor is defined as the fold change of the transcriptome sizes between the simulated tumor cell and the normal cell; Sen represents sensitivity defined as the ratio of correctly identified DEGs to all true DEGs; Spe represents specificity defined as the ratio of correctly identified non-DEGs to all true non-DEGs); F-score is a harmonic mean of the sensitivity and the specificity; FDR is the abbreviation of false discovery rate defined as the ratio of true non-DEGs to all identified DEGs\nTo assess the strength of the methodology, we performed another simulation experiment based on the RNA-sequencing data of the 27 normal samples in the GSE87340 dataset. We randomly generated 4000 up-regulated and 2000 down-regulated genes by changing their measured values in each samples with FC levels of 1.5 to 3.5 to produce 27 disease samples. In each simulation experiment, all the selected genes were set at the same FC level. Each simulation experiment was repeated 100 times. The simulated disease samples were also multiplied by a transcriptome size factor so as to simulate the same amount of total RNA extracted from two samples. The average transcriptome size factors for each 100 simulated experiments were listed in Table\u00a03. Then edge R and RankCompV2 were performed to identify DEGs. The sensitivity, specificity, F-score and FDR were calculated.Table 3\nSimulation evaluation with different FC levels for edgeR and RankCompV2\n\nNote: FC is the abbreviation of Fold change; Factor is defined as the fold change of the transcriptome sizes between the simulated tumor cell and the normal cell; Sen represents sensitivity defined as the ratio of correctly identified DEGs to all true DEGs; Spe represents specificity defined as the ratio of correctly identified non-DEGs to all true non-DEGs); F-score is a harmonic mean of the sensitivity and the specificity; FDR is the abbreviation of false discovery rate defined as the ratio of true non-DEGs to all identified DEGs\nWe collected two datasets of gene expression profiles for each of ten cancer types (Table 1). For each dataset, we compared the DEGs between the normal and cancer samples identified by RankCompV2 with the DEGs identified by SAM for microarray data or by edgeR for RNA-sequencing data. In GSE57957 measured by microarray for liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), SAM identified 11,497 DEGs with false discovery rate (FDR) <\u20090.05, which included 3603 of the 3715 RankCompV2 DEGs. In GSE45267 for LIHC, the 14,192 DEGs selected by SAM included 4712 of the 4728 DEGs detected by RankCompV2. The concordance scores of the dysregulation directions of the overlaps between DEGs detected by RankCompV2 and DEGs detected by SAM in the two datasets were all 100%. Similar results were observed in the 18 datasets for other nine cancer types (Fig. 1a and Additional file 5: Table S2). As expected, POG21 is lower than POG12 because the DEGs identified by RankCompV2 should be included in the DEGs identified by SAM or edgeR. The results confirmed the above mathematical reasoning, which also provided circumstantial evidence of the high accuracy of the RankCompV2 method.\n\nFig. 1\nReproducibility evaluation of DEGs identified by RankCompV2. a Comparison of DEGs identified by RankCompV2 with DEGs identified by SAM or edgeR in the same dataset. POG12 (or POG21) denotes the ratio of consistently detected DEGs by the two methods to DEGs identified by RankCompV2 (or by SAM or edgeR) for the same dataset. b Comparison of RankCompV2 DEGs identified from different datasets. POG12 (or POG21) denotes the ratio of consistently detected DEGs from two datasets to DEGs detected from the first dataset (or the second dataset) for each cancer type. The concordance score denotes the percentage of consistently detected DEGs that display the same dysregulation directions to the overlapped DEGs between two DEG lists\nFor each cancer type, the two lists of DEGs identified from the two datasets by SAM for the microarray data or by edgeR for the RNA-sequencing data were combined, excluding those with contradictory dysregulation directions. Similar combination processes were performed on DEGs selected by RankCompV2. The DEGs identified by RankCompV2, with expression change in both mRNA concentration and absolute abundances, were termed as absolute DEGs, while the DEGs solely detected by SAM or edgeR were termed as relative DEGs with changes in concentration only. The numbers of the absolute DEGs and relative DEGs for the ten cancer types were listed in Table 4. Then, we explored the biological significance of the absolute DEGs.Table 4\nNumbers of identified absolute and relative DEGs in ten cancers\n\nAbbreviation: LIHC Liver hepatocellular carcinoma, KIRC Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, HNSC Head and Neck squamous cell carcinoma, LUSC Lung squamous cell carcinoma, STAD Stomach adenocarcinoma, COAD Colon adenocarcinoma, LUAD Lung adenocarcinoma, BRCA Breast invasive carcinoma, PAAD Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, ESCA Esophageal carcinoma\nWith the 616 cancer driver genes downloaded from the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations (COSMIC, version81, updated 9th May 2017) database [33], we found 25.79% of the 6472 absolute DEGs of LIHC overlapped or directly interacted with known cancer driver genes based on the protein\u2013protein interaction data downloaded from the STRING v10 database [34], which was significantly higher than the corresponding ratio (18.35%) for the 12,049 relative DEGs (Fisher\u2019s exact test, p\u2009<\u00a01.0E-16). Similar results were observed for the remained nine cancer types (Fig.\u00a02a). Based on the cancer driver genes downloaded from the DriverDBv2 database [35], where the driver genes for each cancer type were identified by at least two algorithms from the mutation data in the TCGA database, we also observed significantly higher ratios of cancer driver genes and interaction genes in the absolute DEGs than in the relative DEGs for all the ten cancer types (Fig. 2b). The results indicate that DEGs changing in absolute abundances are more likely to be related with upstream events of carcinogenesis than DEGs changing in concentration only.\n\nFig. 2\nAssociation between the identified absolute and relative DEGs with known cancer driver genes or drug targets. a 616 cancer driver genes from COSMIC; b cancer driver genes from DriverDBv2; c anti-cancer drug targets. Statistically significant differences (p\u2009<\u20090.05) were found in all the ratios between absolute DEGs and relative DEGs\nPathway enrichment analysis was performed for the absolute and relative DEGs, respectively. As shown in Additional file 6: Table S3, for each of the ten cancers, the pathways enriched with the absolute DEGs were much more than and quite different from the pathways enriched with the relative DEGs. As summarized in Fig.\u00a03, the pathways enriched with absolute DEGs for at least five cancer types were very different from the pathways enriched with relative DEGs for at least five cancer types. The up-regulated absolute DEGs were enriched in many pathways related with response to DNA damages, including \u201cmismatch repair\u201d, \u201cbase excision repair\u201d, \u201cnucleotide excision repair\u201d, \u201chomologous recombination\u201d and \u201cFanconi anemia pathway\u201d [37]. These genes were also enriched in \u201cp53 signaling\u201d, \u201ccell cycle\u201d, \u201cDNA replication\u201d, \u201cpyrimidine metabolism\u201d and \u201cpurine metabolism\u201d. The pathways enriched by relative DEGs included \u201cproteasome\u201d and \u201cprotein processing in endoplasmic reticulum\u201d besides \u201cRNA transport\u201d and \u201cspliceosome\u201d which were also enriched by up-regulated absolute DEGs.\n\nFig. 3\nThe pathways significantly enriched with absolute and relative DEGs, respectively, in each cancer type and commonly enriched in at least five cancer types\n\n\nAdditional file 1:\nSupplementary Method including Data and pre-processing, The SAM and edgeR algorithms and simulation experiments on null datasets.

Emerging evidence points to their role in cellular processes and gene regulation. Despite the huge resource of genomic information currently available, SSRs have been studied in a limited context and compared across relatively few species.We have identified ~\u2009685 million eukaryotic microsatellites and analyzed their genomic trends across 15 taxonomic subgroups from protists to mammals. The distribution of SSRs reveals taxon-specific variations in their exonic, intronic and intergenic densities. Our analysis reveals the differences among non-related species and novel patterns uniquely demarcating closely related species. We document several repeats common across subgroups as well as rare SSRs that are excluded almost throughout evolution. We further identify species-specific signatures in pathogens like Leishmania as well as in cereal crops, Drosophila, birds and primates. We also find that distinct SSRs preferentially exist as long repeating units in different subgroups; most unicellular organisms show no length preference for any SSR class, while many SSR motifs accumulate as long repeats in complex organisms, especially in mammals.We present a comprehensive analysis of SSRs across taxa at an unprecedented scale. Our analysis indicates that the SSR composition of organisms with heterogeneous cell types is highly constrained, while simpler organisms such as protists, green algae and fungi show greater diversity in motif abundance, density and GC content. The microsatellite dataset generated in this work provides a large number of candidates for functional analysis and for studying their roles across the evolutionary landscape.Repetitive DNA in eukaryotic genomes can be broadly classified into interspersed and tandem repeats. Microsatellites, also known as Simple Sequence Repeats or SSRs, are short tandem repeats of 1\u20136 nucleotide DNA motifs. They comprise a significant portion of the genome in complex organisms, often surpassing the proportion of coding sequences [1]. SSRs contribute to 3% of the human genome [2], and display a non-random distribution in many genomes [1, 3]. They have high mutation rates due to polymerase slippage, with a bias towards elongation [4]. Due to their highly polymorphic nature, microsatellites have long been used as molecular markers in a variety of fields including genotyping [5], marker-assisted selection [6], linkage analysis [7], and forensics [8]. Though a majority of SSRs in genomes are present at intergenic and non-coding regions, a small proportion of SSRs occur within exons [3, 9]. Abnormal expansion of SSRs within exons is associated with several diseases in humans such as Huntington\u2019s disease and Spinocerebellar Ataxia (reviewed in [10]).Recent studies have focused on the role of SSRs in cellular processes such as the epigenetic regulation of gene expression [11\u201313] and genome organization [14]. Microsatellites are believed to be under selection pressure in genomes, apparent in their distribution and abundance which is much higher than expected by chance or random accumulation [4]. A comprehensive analysis of these elements across the evolutionary landscape can help identify functionally relevant SSRs but in silico studies have mostly been limited by the efficiency, exhaustiveness and sensitivity of the various SSR identification programs they utilize and can be compromised by the quality of the SSR datasets generated [15, 16]. A few studies [1, 3] have chosen a small subset of representative species across evolution to analyze their SSR content but the results may reflect trends that are specific to the chosen species rather than the group they represent, particularly if the sequence quality of the available genomes is variable. Other studies [17\u201320] have limited their analysis to a single taxonomic group, making their observations difficult to understand in terms of the broader evolutionary landscape. These issues can be overcome using an unbiased examination of the genome-wide distribution patterns of microsatellites in related clades, with large-scale comparisons revealing potentially relevant trends.Here, we have identified microsatellites from 719 eukaryotic species and studied their abundance across 15 taxonomic subgroups from protists to mammals, spanning 1.7 billion years of evolution. Our analysis reveals a large number of novel taxon-specific SSR signatures, and evolutionary differences in the context of SSR length, GC content and size of the repeat motifs. Interestingly, the microsatellite trends accurately reflect phylogeny and we posit that they can be useful in understanding evolutionary relationships. Finally, we have used the available genome annotation data from 334 species to understand the distribution of SSRs in coding and non-coding regions and report several novel observations that open up avenues for further experimental scrutiny.At a density of 155 Kb/Mb the human body louse (Pediculus humanus corporis) is the top ranked organism in terms of SSR abundance per Mb of the genome, i.e. 15.5% of its genome is covered by SSRs. A recent analysis also made a similar observation, albiet from a comparison of only insect genomes [20]. At 21 Kb/Mb (SSR coverage 2.13%), humans have almost an order of magnitude lower SSR density than their parasitic louse. Among mammals, the kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ordii) has the highest density (34 Kb/Mb) followed closely by the house mouse (Mus musculus; 33.7 Kb/Mb). As a subgroup, mammals show little variance in SSR densities (about 3 fold difference between the highest and lowest SSR densities within mammals) (Additional file 1: Table S1, Sheet 2).Protists, on the other hand, occupy the highest density ranges and show the greatest variance among individual organismal SSR densities - upto 27 fold difference between the highest and lowest SSR densities among all protists (p\u2009<\u20092.2e-16, F Test, Additional file 2: Figure S1B). For example, the Dictyostelium species (SSR density 143 Kb/Mb, SSR coverage 14.3%) and the Plasmodium species of the Apicomplexans subgroup (SSR density 124 Kb/Mb) have the highest SSR densities among all groups examined while those belonging to the Oomycetes class and the Entamoeba species have significantly lower SSR densities such as Giardia lamblia (SSR density 5228\u2009bp/Mb) and Aphanomyces invadans (SSR density 4070\u2009bp/Mb, only 0.4% of the genome covered by SSRs); in fact they occupy the lowest end of the density spectrum among all 719 species (Additional file 1: Table S1). The Eimeria species of protists from the Apicomplexans subgroup also have a high SSR density (average density 118 Kb/Mb) and these SSRs are notably GC-rich (SSR GC range of around 60%). It is interesting to note that these protists have such a high SSR density despite their small genome size. Fungi have the lowest average SSR density among all the subgroups while among vertebrates, birds have the lowest average, again with very little variance (Additional file 1: Table S1, Sheet 2), with the exception of the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis) that has a very high SSR density of 61 Kb/Mb (SSR frequency of 1.27 million, 6.1% coverage in a genome size of 1.1 Gb). Further analysis of SSR content in this genome revealed multiple instances of long C/G stretches (upto 4\u2009kb) which are likely to be assembly errors creating an artifact in the SSR density calculations.The GC% of the SSRs is well correlated with the genomic GC content (Additional file 2: Figure S2A, Pearson, r\u2009=\u20090.94) and shows some interesting subgroup-specific patterns (Additional file 2: Figure S2B). Green algae (olive green arrow) and a few protists (Aureococcus anophagefferens, Emiliania huxleyi, Thecamonas trahens) with GC-rich genomes (genomic GC 55\u201365%) have an abundance of GC-rich SSRs (SSR GC range 75\u2013100%). SSRs of intermediate GC content (SSR GC range 50%) are abundant in fungi. Protostomes and deuterostomes, however, have uniformly AT-rich SSRs (SSR GC range\u2009<\u200925%). We note that there is no correlation between the overall SSR abundance of an organism and its genomic GC content (Additional file 2: Figure S1A).Fungi instead have highly abundant ACG, CCG and other GC-rich repeats (black/blue tiles at B8-E8) that are not very abundant in multicellular organisms. Green algae show a high abundance of some GC-rich repeats (B8, B18, B20) correlating with their high average genomic GC content of 61.3%. Interestingly, in many fungi, especially from the Ascomycetes and Microsporidia subgroups, upto 95% of the repeat classes appear to be missing (red tiles at D7-D20 and E2-E20, respectively; frequency of occurrence <\u200910) though this trend shows a sharp change in the Basidiomycetes subgroup where only a few SSR classes are absent. Some of the Protists (row F, red tiles) and green algae (B2-B7, B9-B17) too show a similar trend. Most other organisms (486/719 organisms) have some representation of all 501 classes of SSRs. Notably, the ACGCGT repeat is absent in about 64% of the organisms across evolution (A10.5 \u2013 G10.5 and H10.5 \u2013 K10.5, red arrow), except for bees, ants, wasps, and some fungi. Similarly, AGCGCT (red arrow) also appears to be unpopular, missing from about 51% of the genomes, including all deuterostomes. Both these repeats in fact have the smallest lengths of occurrence as well (see below) suggesting that they are not well tolerated in genomes.We next looked for SSRs that were highly abundant in only specific species or subgroups but not in any of the other organisms (Table 1). For example, a small group of land plants - cereals like maize, sorghum, millet, rice and corn (A8, arrow) - show some GC-rich repeats to be uniquely enriched. They also harbor abundant ACG and CCG repeats (A8) otherwise seen in fungi. Unique species-specific enrichment signatures can also be found in the Leishmania (F7) and Drosophila (G8, arrow) species as well as in higher organisms such as birds (I4), ruminants (bison, cattle, water buffalo, yak, sheep and goats - J5, J6, J14), and in primates (K6, AATGG and K9, ACCTCC, arrows) (Table 1 and Additional file 2: Figure S3). We also notice other subtle trends - for instance crocodilians such as gharials, crocodiles and alligators show a relative abundance for AGCCCC (I16) - but many of these are not uniquely abundant or significantly enriched specifically in their target species (p\u2009>\u20090.05) and are hence not analyzed further. Notably, the enrichment trend for specific SSRs is sharply contained within each of these groups of organisms (Fig. 2), clearly defining them as species-specific enrichment signatures. A few of these SSRs have also been previously identified as being enriched in a species-specific manner in smaller scale studies limited to a few species or subgroups [21\u201323].SSR rank is calculated based on relative density compared to other SSRs within the organism as described in Fig.\u00a04. An SSR is considered abundant in the species if it falls within the top 10 ranks. It is considered uniquely abundant (enriched) in a species if it falls within the top 10 ranks of SSRs in that species but not in any other species (*p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.001, ***p\u2009<\u20091E-05, t-test). The estimated divergence time point from the common ancestor is retrieved from Timetree (http://www.timetree.org), Ma\u2009=\u2009Million Years Ago.We looked at the length of each SSR across all occurrences in the 719 organisms. As expected, longer SSRs were found to be present in the larger genomes (Spearman, r\u2009=\u20090.87; Additional file 2: Figure S4A). We identified the longest perfect SSRs found in each of the 719 organisms; AACCCT, the known telomeric repeat, is the longest SSR in 9% of the organisms (70 out of 743), with a top length of 15\u2009kb in the fish Rhincodon typus (whale shark). We next looked at other longest repeats apart from the telomeric repeat and found that AT and AAT also frequently appear as the longest SSRs (in 8% organisms; top lengths 17.3\u2009kb and 19.3\u2009kb, respectively). The longest SSR seen among all organisms is almost 52\u2009kb long \u2013 12,980 perfectly repeating units of AAAT in the mammalian Cercocebus atys mapping to an intergenic region, at a distance of 23.5\u2009kb from the nearest gene, LOC105598351.We further checked if the longest instances of repeats in a subgroup belonged to specific repeat classes. We observed that distinct SSRs preferentially exist as long repeating units in different subgroups (Fig. 3b). AACCCT, the telomeric repeat, is surprisingly not the longest repeat to be maximally represented in any subgroup except kinetoplasts (p\u2009<\u200910e-5, Fisher\u2019s exact test). Instead, AGAT is the predominantly represented long SSR in fishes and reptiles, and AAAG in mammals. Dimers of AC, AG and AT vary in their representation as long stretches in different subgroups; plants have maximal representation of AG and AT as longest SSRs while animals generally have longer AC stretches than AG or AT stretches (p\u2009<\u200910e-5, Fisher\u2019s exact test). We next calculated the median from the 1000 longest instances of each SSR class to check for the preference of various SSR classes to exist as long repeats (Additional\u00a0file\u00a03: Table S2). Interestingly, the median values range from as high as 1.26\u2009kb (AT repeats) to as low as 15\u2009bp (AGCGCT repeats). While no obvious common motif pattern could be observed for the classes that showed the longest lengths, SSRs which showed the shortest lengths appeared to be of motifs with GC-rich centers flanked by A/T, but never completely GC-rich (Additional file 2: Figure S4B), such as the two rarest repeats described in the previous section, AGCGCT and ACGCGT.The frequency of an SSR is expected to decline with increasing repeat length, as longer repeats have a higher chance of being mutated. We have demonstrated earlier that certain SSRs, however, show a preference for occurring at higher lengths in some organisms [24], with greater protein binding efficiency at the preferred lengths [14]. A length preference is defined as a sudden increase in the frequency of occurrence seen at a particular range of SSR length (Additional file 2: Figure S5A). Our earlier work has indicated that 45\u2009bp repeat size is the optimum length for a majority of the SSRs, especially in the human genome [24]. Here we confirm that length preference is seen for relatively longer SSR size ranges in all genomes (~\u200950\u2009bp), except in fungi where SSR preferred lengths are generally smaller (~\u200920\u2009bp) (Additional\u00a0file\u00a04: Table S3). We find that only 131 out of the 501 SSRs can be associated with a specific length preference in at least one organism. We tabulated the length preference of each of the 131 SSRs across all 719 organisms and converted it to a heat map of percentage of organisms within a subgroup that show length preference for a given SSR (Additional file 2: Figure S6). Fungi do not exhibit length preference for many SSR classes; none of the microsporidia show a length preference for any SSR (0%, red cells) while just 10\u201312% of Basidiomycetes show a preference for the polyA and polyC SSRs. In fact, as seen in Additional file 2: Figure S6, most unicellular organisms show no length preference for any SSR class. However, with increasing complexity of the organisms, a higher number of SSR motifs have accumulated as long repeats, the most being in mammals where as many as 85 SSR classes show a length preference (last column). This suggests that certain SSR motifs have been selected at long sizes for possible functional roles. AAAG and AGAT show a length preference in >\u200980% of mammalian species, followed by polyA and AAGG (73% mammals show length preference). This trend does not appear to be a function of the genome size (Additional file 2: Figure S5B).Trimers are especially low in proportion in higher vertebrates such as birds and mammals but in green algae and some protists, trimers constitute a large proportion of all motif types, second only to their hexamer content (Fig. 4). Overall, hexamers are the predominant SSR type in all organisms. Their proportion however is lower in complex organisms compared to protists, plants and fungi where they are the most abundant (~\u200970% in microsporidia). Tetramers too show a noticeable difference, but in the opposite direction - tetramer percentages are lower in simpler organisms (protists to fungi) compared to protostomes and deuterostomes. Tetra- and pentamers show least variance in distribution across subgroups while dimers show the maximum divergence. These trends highlight the differences in the organization of eukaryotic genomes and could be a reflection of the variable SSR mutation rates and propagation among the coding and non-coding compartments.Subgroup specific motif size distributions across genome annotations replicate these broad trends between exonic and non-coding regions (Additional file 2: Figure S9). Most repeat types such as monomers, dimers and tetramers are generally more abundant in introns and intergenic regions compared to exons across all taxa, while trimers and hexamers increase in exons. Mammals show an abundance of tetramers compared to trimers in introns and intergenic regions, a trend mirrored in other deuterostomes albeit to a lesser extent. But the same is not seen in land plants and they have equivalent tetra- and trimers in their non-coding regions. Dimers are under-represented in exons across all groups, occurring at higher frequencies in non-coding regions. Interestingly, dimers are most enriched in the non-coding regions of fishes and molluscs contributing to 18\u201327% of SSRs, comparable to their hexamer content, while birds have the lowest contribution of dimers across all genomic regions (2\u20133%) as mentioned earlier.Microsatellites are increasingly being recognized as critical sequence components with multiple roles in genome regulation. We identified perfect SSRs of 1\u20136\u2009nt motifs from 719 genomes spanning 15 eukaryotic taxonomic subgroups including protists, plants, fungi, invertebrates and vertebrates. We find that the distribution pattern of SSRs is a characteristic of the species or subgroup of the organism and that different taxonomic groups have distinct patterns of microsatellite presence, abundance and length preferences.Longer repeats are generally found in larger genomes and most repeats tend to decrease in frequency at higher lengths. PolyA-rich repeats such as AT and AAT and A(n)G tend to have the longest lengths of occurrence. Earlier studies [3] have shown dimers to be the predominant longer repeats in introns and intergenic regions of genomes (except fungi). Subgroup specific longest SSRs identified in this work include AGAT (fish, reptiles) and AAAG repeats (mammals) as the predominant long repeats in vertebrates while AG/AC/AT dimers and AAT are frequent long repeats in lower organisms and in land plants (AT/AG). 131 out of the 501 possible repeat classes show a specific enrichment at longer lengths in at least one species studied; mammals display a length preference in 65% of these repeat classes while none of the fungi and only some protists show a length preference in any repeats. The preferred accumulation of longer repeats may point to a selection pressure on these elements in a repeat class- and organism-specific manner. We have earlier shown that AGAT repeats show a preferred length of 40-48\u2009nt (10\u201312 repeat units), and these elements function as enhancer blockers in Drosophila and human cells [14]. In this context, we find that AGAT shows a length preference in many species (171 out of 719, out of which 82 are mammals), suggesting that its functional role could have been co-opted by multiple organisms.The sharp boundaries of change in SSR abundance coincide perfectly with the phylogeny of groups and subgroups. We were able to identify many taxon-specific microsatellite patterns within closely related species. In the light of the high polymorphism of microsatellites normally seen among individuals of the same species, identification of tightly conserved species-specific enrichment is useful in the context of microsatellite markers. Whether specific enrichment of a particular SSR indicates functional significance or mirrors close evolutionary relationships remains to be verified experimentally. Repeat elements have long been thought to have functional, mutational and evolutionary significance [25, 26] and experimental evidence of a role for SSRs is increasingly available, albeit in only a few species per study (reviewed in [27]). While this manuscript was being reviewed, another study was published that showed differential distribution of human-specific SSRs at translation initiation sites [28] with implications for directing species-specific translation events and thus the phenotype. Such studies bolster recent work on the evolutionary trends and influence of SSRs in defining species specificity and warrant larger scale analysis across the evolutionary landscape.The integrity of genome assembly and sequence information for different organisms can be an issue in such analysis, affecting SSR identification and inferences. In this context, our analysis of trends across subgroups alleviates, to an extent, the problems arising due to poor quality information from a particular genome; outlier trends need to be examined on a case by case basis as they might reflect the quality \u2013 accuracy and completeness - of the genome assembly. While this work provides a global framework for understanding microsatellite function, it is important to understand the role(s) of specific SSRs in the context of their genomic locations. However, the current level of genome annotation does not allow such an analysis at this scale, limiting this study to the analysis of SSR distribution trends in exonic, intronic and intergenic regions for 334 genomes where such annotations are available. The observations presented in this work serve as a snapshot of eukaryotic genomes in the context of perfect SSRs \u2013 instances of repeats that were preserved without even a single nucleotide change. We have not considered imperfect SSRs in our study to avoid limitations posed by currently available imperfect SSR identification tools. Hence, this work cannot address whether these elements are a consequence of DNA repair / replication errors or mutational mechanisms. Different taxonomic groups have distinct patterns of microsatellite presence and abundance, representing their establishment in a common ancient founding member of all organisms in the group. Evolutionary trends thus correlate with the preferential and selective inclusion of SSRs that may have been retained for the advantage they confer via novel regulatory mechanisms. These are testable hypotheses and the SSR signatures identified in this work can serve as a starting point for understanding this paradigm.We have identified nearly 685 million perfect SSRs across 719 eukaryotes to reveal constraints in SSR distribution across evolutionarily related species. Our results provide a comprehensive framework to understand microsatellite features in genomes. We have documented novel species- and subgroup-specific patterns of SSR enrichment that offer insights into microsatellite conservation among taxonomic groups. Interestingly, some defined patterns seem to persist in genomes, especially across multicellular and complex organisms, suggesting a role for SSRs in the genome regulatory toolkit.The latest versions of eukaryotic genome sequences available on NCBI\u2019s RefSeq database were downloaded from the FTP site of NCBI (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome). The primary classification of each organism was adopted from NCBI using the hierarchical classification of kingdom, group, and subgroup. As our study was limited to eukaryotic species, all organisms belonged to the kingdom \u201cEukaryota\u201d; the group Animalia was subdivided into Protostomes and Deuterostomes. In order to investigate globally conserved evolutionary trends, we utilized the subgroup information of NCBI to categorize all the species. Poorly represented subgroups (<\u20095 species) were removed from the analysis to avoid sampling error; these included 2 poriferans, 3 cnidarians, 3 flatworms, 4 arachnids and a few singleton species belonging to distant taxa. We preferred not to merge clades containing few representatives as this could confound the trends in favor of the most represented sub-clade. The final list consisted of 719 species spanning 15 subgroups (Fig.\u00a01 and Additional file 1: Table S1). Detailed taxonomic classification of these organisms was gathered using an R package taxize [29], which fetches the class, order and family information of species where available. All the organisms were arranged in an evolutionary order using TimeTree [30] and this order was consistently followed for all further analyses. The hierarchical classification provided by TimeTree was downloaded as a newick file and was used for visualization using the iTOL (interactive Tree of Life) webserver [31].Perfect SSRs >\u2009=\u200912\u2009nt in length were identified from sequences of all downloaded genomes using a Python-based exhaustive algorithm, PERF [15]. We chose to work with SSRs that were at least 12\u2009nt in length in order to consider at least 2 complete repeating units of hexamers (the largest motif size in the study). The 5356 possible permutations of 1\u20136\u2009nt long DNA motifs were grouped into 501 unique classes of SSRs based on the cyclical variations and strand of the motif sequence, as described previously [32]. A repeat class motif represents all the motifs which are cyclical variations of itself and of its reverse complement (Additional\u00a0file\u00a05: Table S4). PERF reports all SSR locations in the genome in BED format, with additional columns describing the length of the repeat sequence, the repeat class, number of times the motif is repeated in tandem (repeating units), and the actual repeat motif (defined by the start of the SSR sequence, irrespective of repeat class). Using these parameters, we identified a total of 684,885,656 repeats from the genome data of 719 species.For each organism, we calculated a few parameters that outline the prevalence of SSRs in the genome. SSR frequency is the total number of SSRs found in the genome. The total bases covered by SSRs in the genome is calculated by summing the lengths of all the SSRs. To normalize for differences in genome sizes across evolutionary groups, we derived the SSR density for each genome, defined as the number of bases covered by SSRs per MB of genome. This was calculated by dividing the total SSR bases with the genome size in MB. We have used SSR density for comparisons throughout the study, unless otherwise mentioned. The SSR GC% of an organism is the GC% of the sequence formed by concatenating all the repeat sequences found in the genome. A master table containing all the SSR attributes, along with the taxonomical classification and genome information of each organism, is available in Additional file 1: Table S1, Sheet 1.SSR frequency, base coverage, and density for each of the 501 repeat classes were calculated in each organism using in-house Python scripts. To identify repeats that are enriched/absent in various sets of organisms independent of their taxa, we ranked all the repeat classes based on their density in each organism. Briefly, we first gave the lowest score of \u2212\u20092 to those repeats which had a frequency of <\u200910 in a given organism, to reduce sampling bias. Further, we assigned scores 3, 2, and 1 to repeats with the top 10, 25 and 100 ranks in the genome, respectively. Repeats in the bottom 100 ranks and frequency of at least 10 were given a score of \u2212\u20091. All other repeats were assigned a score of 0. A matrix was built using the score information, where each row represents an organism and columns represent the repeat classes. Hierarchical clustering of the repeat classes was done using the Euclidean distance between columns of the matrix. This scoring system was used to maximize the clustering of repeats based on similarities in enrichment/absence, as Euclidean distance is sensitive to variance in the data. The clustered matrix was visualized as a heatmap using Morpheus (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/), an interactive tool for generation and exploratory analysis. The color scale on the heatmap ranged from a high score of 3 (black) to a lowest of \u2212\u20092 (red) as described above and in Fig. 2. The repeats and organism information in the heatmap can be obtained by loading the provided json file into Morpheus (Additional\u00a0file\u00a06: Heatmap.json). The ranks were used for heatmap generation and clustering to identify clade-specific signatures. These signature motifs were further validated using statistical tests based on the original SSR density values (Table 1).Contrary to the expected gradual decrease in abundance of longer repeats, some repeat classes show an increase in abundance at longer lengths. This pattern appears as a peak with local maxima when unit length vs abundance for a repeat class is visualized as a line chart (Additional file 2: Figure S5A). A custom Python script was developed to detect repeat classes showing this pattern in all organisms (Additional file 7). Briefly, the script compares the abundance at consecutive unit lengths to detect an increase. The unit length before the first detected increase is considered the peak start. The script further checks if the increase continues to a local maxima followed by a decrease in abundance. The endpoint of the curve is defined as the unit length where the abundance goes lower than the abundance at the peak start. To filter false positives, we only considered instances which span at least 4 consecutive unit lengths (start and end included), and where the abundance at the peak start is greater than 10.Repeat classes were categorized based on the length of the base repeat motif as monomers to hexamers. A size category is defined as the group of repeat classes encompassing all SSR motifs of the same length. The base coverage of a size category is calculated by summing up the base coverage for all the repeat classes falling in that category. For GC composition analysis, we categorized the 501 repeat classes into 5 groups based on the GC content of the repeat motif. This was calculated using the 12\u2009bp string (minimum length cutoff) formed by repeating the base motif in tandem. The 5 groups of SSR GC content are <=25%, 26\u201349, 50%, 51\u201374%, >\u2009=\u200975%, which encompass 70, 120, 133, 108, and 170 motifs respectively.GFF files containing gene annotation information of various organisms were downloaded from the FTP site of NCBI (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome). Annotation for SSRs was done based on the GFF files using an in-house Python script (Additional file 8). In brief, the script uses the genic and exon coordinates to identify SSRs that overlap either exons, introns, or intergenic regions. For each SSR, the output includes its genomic annotation, and its distance to the nearest TSS. In addition, for all exonic SSRs, the percentage overlap of SSR with an exon is reported. This was done to ensure that our results are not skewed because of a high proportion of SSRs falling within exon-intron boundaries. We verified that >\u200995% of exonic SSRs show a complete overlap with exons.Two sample t-test was done using t.test() function in R. Pairwise calculations were done using pairwise.t.test() in R, and p-values were adjusted using Bonferroni correction. Paired sample t-test was done using ttest_rel() function of SciPy package in Python. F-test to assay the significance in the variance of SSR densities was performed using var.test() function in R. One-way ANOVA (Analysis of variance) followed by Tukey\u2019s post-hoc tests were done using aov() and TukeyHSD() functions of R respectively, using a confidence interval of 0.99. Fisher\u2019s exact test was done using fisher.test() function of R. Plots were made using ggplot2 and the Plotly API of R and Python unless specified otherwise.Analysis of varianceBrowser Extensible DataFile Transfer ProtocolGeneral Feature Formatinteractive Tree of LifeSimple Sequence RepeatsPublication of this article was funded by grants from the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (BSC0121, BSC0118).

We identified a total of 684,885,656 perfect SSRs (length\u2009>\u2009= 12\u2009bp) and analyzed their distribution patterns across organisms divided into 5 main groups (protists, plants, fungi, protostomes and deuterostomes) constituting 15 subgroups (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table\u00a0S1). Figure\u00a01 summarizes the distribution of SSRs across each taxonomic group and their genomic relationships. As expected, the total SSR abundance is correlated with genome size (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Figure S1A, Pearson, r\u2009=\u20090.96). The top 50 organisms with high SSR frequency are mostly mammals including humans (4.6 million SSRs), a plant (Aegilops tauschii) and some fish (salmon species and coelacanth), each containing 4\u20135 million SSRs and with genome sizes >\u20092.2 Gb. Of note, the highest number of SSRs are found in the octopus (7.6 million; genome size 2.3 Gb), the only non-vertebrate animal in the top 50 of the SSR abundance table (Additional file 1: Table S1). At 1181 SSRs, the fungus Encephalitozoon romaleae (subgroup microsporidia) has the lowest number of SSRs, which correlates well with the fact that this pathogen has one of the smallest genomes studied (2.2\u2009Mb). In order to normalize their occurrence to the genome size we looked at the density of SSRs (i.e. bp covered by SSRs per Mb of the genome). We found that unlike SSR abundance, there is no correlation between the SSR density and the genome size (Additional file 2: Figure S1A; Pearson, r\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.04), though land plants do show a slight negative correlation (Pearson, r\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.43) as documented previously [19].Table 1\nUniquely abundant SSRs showing species-specific enrichment\n\n\nFig. 1\nOverview of SSRs analyzed in this study. Approximately 685 million perfect SSRs (at least 12\u2009bp in length) were identified from 719 eukaryotes across 15 subgroups, color coded and divided into 5 groups. Numbers in parenthesis indicate the number of organisms in each subgroup. The total number of SSRs (in millions) analyzed in each subgroup is indicated. Box plots indicate the distribution of genomic sizes (highly variable across taxonomic groups, left) and the SSR coverage (% of genome covered by SSRs which is relatively uniform, right) in each subgroup\nWe plotted a ranked SSR density heat map (Fig.\u00a02, see methods) to look at density-based abundance trends of the 501 SSRs (columns) across all the 719 genomes (rows). SSRs were considered abundant in an organism if they occurred in the top 10 (black tiles) or top 25 (blue tiles) ranks. We discovered clear patterns of abundance that were distinct for different groups and even subgroups of organisms. As seen along the left-most columns of the heat map (Fig. 2, black tiles at A1-K1 on the grid), a few SSRs are highly abundant across most organisms - viz. C, AC, AG and the polyA repeat classes including A, A(n)T/G/C (density\u2009>\u2009100\u2009bp/Mb). But they are rare in green algae and some of the fungi of the ascomycetes and basidiomycetes groups; some of these SSRs are in fact entirely missing in these groups as indicated by the red tiles (frequency\u2009<\u200910; B1 and B2 on the grid in Fig. 2).\n\nFig. 2\nEnrichment trend of the 501 SSRs across 719 genomes. SSRs in an organism are ranked based on their density, defined as the total number of bp covered by the SSR in an organism normalized to genome size (that is, bp covered/Mb). The density based ranking is used to generate a heat map as per the color scale indicated. The 501 SSRs are arranged in columns and the 719 organisms are arranged in rows (the 5 main groups are indicated on the right; subgroups are indicated below the heatmap). Alphabets on the left and numbers at the bottom of the heatmap indicate approximate positions of the tiles in a virtual grid (eg., A1 to K20). Arrows mark the positions for uniquely abundant (enriched) SSR signatures described in the text and in Table 1\nWe then analyzed the length distribution for each SSR in a subgroup-specific manner (Fig.\u00a03a). As a single instance of a long repeat could potentially be an outlier or an assembly error, and may not accurately reflect the general trend, we derived the 100 longest repeat instances from each organism, and grouped them by the subgroup of the organism. Figure\u00a03a depicts the range of subgroup-wise longest instances. Differences among subgroups within a group could often be correlated with the differences in their genome sizes. However, birds are an exception to this: despite having genome sizes significantly smaller than reptiles (p\u2009<\u200910e-9, pairwise t test, Bonferroni corrected) and mammals (p\u2009<\u20092e-16, pairwise t test, Bonferroni corrected), their SSR length range is higher than reptiles and mammals (p\u2009<\u20092e-16, pairwise t test, Bonferroni corrected).\n\nFig. 3\nSSR lengths across subgroups. a The top 100 longest repeat instances from each organism are recorded separately and the data for organisms falling in the same subgroup are then grouped. Box plots showing the range of the longest 100 repeat lengths in the organisms of a particular subgroup are plotted. Color indicates the main group to which the subgroup belongs. b The percentage of occurrence of a repeat class in the top 100 longest SSRs across all organisms is calculated to select SSRs that occurred at least 1% of the times. The average percentage of these \u2018highest occurring\u2019 SSRs across organisms in each subgroup is plotted (Y-axis), categorizing the rest of the SSRs into \u201cOther\u201d. Individual SSRs are color-coded as indicated. The 15 subgroups are labeled along the X-axis\nTo check if different repeat classes are preferred through evolution, we looked at the distribution of SSRs across all the subgroups based on the size of the base repeat motif (Fig. 4). We categorized the repeat classes as monomers to hexamers for repeats with motif sizes of 1 to 6\u2009nt. We find that monomers are abundant in birds and mammals (15\u201317% of total SSRs) and rare in green algae and fungi. Within mammals, primates have the highest contribution of monomers (18%; Additional file 2: Figure S7A). Of the two possible monomers, polyA is largely preferred by all subgroups other than green algae (Additional file 2: Figure S7B), which is a reflection of their genomic GC content. The polyA bias is conspicuous especially in mammals, where A contributes >\u200990% of the monomers as seen in Additional file 2: Figure S7B; in primates, the proportion of polyA rises to 99% of all monomers (Additional file 2: Figure S8A). Birds and fungi have the lowest dimer content (Fig. 4) while molluscs and fishes have the highest (median %\u2009=\u200920.93 and 20.52, respectively). Insects, mammals and land plants show similar abundance (~\u200911%) but within mammals, rodents are prominent in their high dimer content (17.96% in rodents vs 11.8% in other mammals; Additional file 2: Figure S7A). CG repeats are extremely rare, contributing to less than 1% of all dimers in most species except green algae and basidiomycetes, where they contribute to 9.5 and 6% of dimers, respectively (Additional file 2: Figure S8B). AT repeats constitute the highest share of dimers in apicomplexans (93% of dimers) and land plants (62.3% of dimers), while AC dimers are the most frequent dimers in species of most other subgroups. Similar trends in dimer abundance have been previously documented for a few vertebrate species [3].\n\nFig. 4\nComposition of SSRs by their motif sizes. The number of bases covered by repeats of different motif sizes is summed across all organisms within a subgroup and divided by the total number of bases covered by all SSRs in that subgroup. Box plots for each subgroup represent the percentage of each k-mer base coverage (Y-axis) in the subgroup (X-axis)\nThere has long been evidence for non-random genomic distribution of SSRs showing differential distribution across chromosomes and genomic features [1]. We therefore looked at the distribution of SSRs across 334 organisms spanning 7 of the 15 subgroups for which genome annotations are available (Additional file 1: Table S1) in order to understand biases in distribution trends and possible functions. Overall, the distribution of SSRs in intergenic, intronic and exonic regions reflects their genomic distribution with intergenic regions having the highest abundance of SSRs (Fig.\u00a05a). However, we do see a small but significant underrepresentation of SSRs in exons (p\u2009<\u200910e-40, paired-sample t-test). This distribution remains the same across all the 7 subgroups, correlating with the respective genomic percentages of intergenic regions, introns and exons. We checked for specific differences in the genomic distribution of SSRs with respect to the repeat motif size. Introns and intergenic regions mostly show a similar distribution except in monomers which are slightly enriched in introns (Fig. 5b). Exons, however, show a significant difference in the proportions of different motif sizes compared to the non-coding regions. Trimers and hexamers increase in exons compared to introns by ~\u20097 and 16%, respectively (Fig. 5b). An earlier study has indicated that trimers are the most abundant group in exons [3], but we find that in fact hexamers tend to be more abundant in exons, similar to the trend observed in non-coding regions. Dimers and tetramers are under-represented in exons as expected due to the disruption they can cause to the coding frame, occurring at higher frequencies in non-coding regions.\n\nFig. 5\nMotif size dependent distribution of SSRs among various genomic features. a Boxplots representing the proportion of SSRs in intergenic regions, introns, and exons across subgroups. The distribution of SSRs in intergenic and intronic regions (shaded boxes) mostly mirror their genomic distributions (non-shaded boxes). However, we see a small but significant underrepresentation of SSRs in exons (right panel, p\u2009<\u200910e-40, paired-sample t-test). b Average distribution of SSRs in coding and non-coding regions in all species studied, colored by the size of repeat motif. The percentage of trimer and hexamer repeats is higher in exonic SSRs at the expense of tetramers and dimers. The fraction of each motif size is calculated as the total bases covered by SSRs of a given motif size divided by the total bases covered by all SSRs. This value is multiplied by 100 to derive percentages (the total for all motif sizes add up to 100), represented on the Y-axis\nInterestingly, most fungi do not have >\u200990% of the SSR classes, and also show the lowest SSR densities, indicating that these species may be under a different set of constraints in what their genomes can adopt. Other lower organisms \u2013 such as some protists and green algae \u2013 also lack many repeat classes while invertebrates and vertebrates have a representation of almost all SSR classes. Exceptions are the ACGCGT and AGCGCT repeats that occur rarely in evolution, with >\u200950% of all organisms excluding them altogether, including many vertebrates. Even in the few species of hymenopterans such as ants, bees and wasps where these repeats occur at a moderate frequency, they are of short lengths. We hypothesize that such sequences constitute a rare class of SSRs that are not tolerated in genomes. We find large variations in the densities of SSRs in protists, a subgroup that encompasses both SSR-dense as well as SSR-sparse genomes. More complex organisms, however, show lesser variation in SSR densities (summarized in Fig.\u00a06), suggesting greater constraints operating upon their genomes. Protists have very varied SSR GC contents as well - Dictyostelium and Plasmodium species harbor AT-rich SSRs while Eimeria and Micromonas species have GC-rich repeats. Green algae have a preponderance of GC-rich SSRs while most fungal SSRs are of intermediate GC content. On the other hand, complex genomes, including in land plants, carry only AT-rich SSRs with most GC-rich repeats having been filtered out (Fig. 6). This stability in SSR composition is reflected in the relatively uniform content of genomic GC seen across vertebrates. We found abnormally high enrichment of select repeat classes in protists, viz. A repeats in Plasmodium species and AGC repeats in Eimeria species, which contribute to 40\u201370% of their total SSR content. An interesting coincidence is that most of these protists are parasites. It needs to be further explored whether the preferential enrichment of a single repeat type in their genomes is beneficial to their pathogenesis.\n\nFig. 6\nPhylogenetic tree representation summarizing attributes of all SSRs analyzed. The tree was constructed using iTOL (interactive Tree Of Life) webserver. The clade nodes are colored based on the 5 groups used in this study. Black bars (the innermost track) around the organisms represent the SSR density (bases covered per MB of genome) in each organism. The orange tracks around the SSR density show the SSR GC% in each organism (the innermost orange track represents the relative enrichment of motifs with <=25% GC, while the outermost orange track represents SSR GC\u2009>\u2009=75%) and the middle three tracks represent intermediate GC ranges. The size of each dot on the track (representing each organism) indicates the amount of SSRs present in that GC range. The orange bars represent the genomic GC content. The black tracks show the distribution in each organism based on the motif size of the repeat (the innermost black track represents monomers while the outermost black track represents hexamers). The size of each dot on the track (representing each organism) indicates the proportion of SSRs present in that motif size range\n\n\nAdditional file 1:\nTable S1.

The rapid advance of next generation sequencing (NGS) provides a high-throughput means of SNP discovery. However, SNP development is limited by the availability of reliable SNP discovery methods. Especially, the optimum assembler and SNP caller for accurate SNP prediction from next generation sequencing data are not known.Herein we performed SNP prediction based on RNA-seq data of peach and mandarin peel tissue under a comprehensive comparison of two paired-end read lengths (125\u2009bp and 150\u2009bp), five assemblers (Trinity, IDBA, oases, SOAPdenovo, Trans-abyss) and two SNP callers (GATK and GBS). The predicted SNPs were compared with the authentic SNPs identified via PCR amplification followed by gene cloning and sequencing procedures. A total of 40 and 240 authentic SNPs were presented in five anthocyanin biosynthesis related genes in peach and in nine carotenogenic genes in mandarin. Putative SNPs predicted from the same RNA-seq data with different strategies led to quite divergent results. The rate of false positive SNPs was significantly lower when the paired-end read length was 150\u2009bp compared with 125\u2009bp. Trinity was superior to the other four assemblers and GATK was substantially superior to GBS due to a low rate of missing authentic SNPs. The combination of assembler Trinity, SNP caller GATK, and the paired-end read length 150\u2009bp had the best performance in SNP discovery with 100% accuracy both in peach and in mandarin cases. This strategy was applied to the characterization of SNPs in peach and mandarin transcriptomes.Through comparison of authentic SNPs obtained by PCR cloning strategy and putative SNPs predicted from different combinations of five assemblers, two SNP callers, and two paired-end read lengths, we provided a reliable and efficient strategy, Trinity-GATK with 150\u2009bp paired-end read length, for SNP discovery from RNA-seq data. This strategy discovered SNP at 100% accuracy in peach and mandarin cases and might be applicable to a wide range of plants and other organisms.Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are single nucleotide base variations, caused by transitions (C/T or G/A) or transversions (C/G, C/A, or T/A, T/G), in the same position between individual genomic DNA sequences [1, 2]. SNP is the predominant type of DNA polymorphism for genetic variation, which is ubiquitously located in genomes [3, 4] in the intergenic region (regions between genes), coding sequences of genes (exons), or non-coding regions of genes (introns, 5\u2019UTR, 3\u2019UTR, or exon-intron splicing sites) [5]. SNPs in the coding region can be divided into two types, synonymous and nonsynonymous SNPs, with protein sequence affected by the latter type.Considerable effects on protein function and gene expression can be caused by SNPs occurring in coding regions and regulatory sequences, respectively. Therefore, SNPs are of great potential in genetics, breeding, ecological and evolutionary studies [6]. Due to the high density, scalability and genome-wide distribution, SNPs are considered as ideal genomic resources in genetic studies for the characterization of genetic resources and functional gene identification for traits [7]. In plant genetics for instance, SNPs have been widely used to identify cis-regulatory variation within a species based on allele-specific assays and to discover genes linked to complex genetic traits.With the rapid advances in modern sequencing technology, or next generation sequencing (NGS), de novo and reference-based SNP discovery is performed in numerous organisms, including many plants, even those where there is little or no genetic information available [8]. The availability of NGS provides a convenient approach to discover all SNPs and obtain relevant information on genomic position and genotyping in a single step. Data from reliable large-scale sequencing, especially in diploid plants [9], could improve the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of detection of abundant SNPs. A number of methods have been used for initial SNPs discovery in a high-throughput manner, such as whole-genome sequencing, exome capture, RNA sequencing, methylated DNA sequencing, and restriction enzyme (RE) digestion [10].Recently, transcriptome sequencing, or RNA-seq, has become one of the most representative high-throughput sequence-based techniques because of its high accuracy and cost-effective. There are multiple advantages in carrying out SNP analysis using RNA-seq data. Firstly, thousands of SNPs can be discovered and the expression levels of functional genes with sequence variations can be observed simultaneously at a reasonable cost. Secondly, the location of variations in coding regions associated with plant biological and agronomical traits can be identified and the phenotypes can be predicted according to genotypes [11]. In addition, it is also a useful platform for related studies like gene characterization, gene expression quantification as well as post translational process analysis [12]. For these reasons, RNA-seq is developing into an extensive application in genetic polymorphisms analysis.The basic procedures for converting raw data generated from whole genome or transcriptome sequencing into a final SNP result include obtaining raw data from NGS platforms, assembling, and SNP calling to identify SNP between the same unigenes or between different samples from different plant varieties or within one sample when the plant is genetically heterogeneous. Different NGS platforms such as Illumina Genome Analyzer, Roche/454 FLX and ABI SOLiD vary in terms of sensitivity, accuracy, reproducibility and throughput and this means that sequencing data obtained from different platforms has various advantages and limitations [13, 14]. At present, Illumina with good sequencing coverage and read quality, is applied to many plant species for SNP detection by RNA-seq. Currently, assemblers such as Trinity, IDBA, oases, SOAPdenovo and trans-abyss [15, 16] and SNP callers, or variant callers, Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) [17], Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) [18], SAMtools/BCFtools [19], freebayes [20] and SOAPsnp [21], especially the former two callers, are the most extensively used. RNA-seq can produce massive SNPs at relatively low costs. On the other hand, omissions and errors are major obstacles for SNP identification from RNA-seq data. The availability of multiple choices for different read lengths, assemblers and SNP callers make the SNP analysis even more complicated. It was reported that different read lengths, assemblers and SNP callers all contribute to the accuracy and reliability of the final SNP result [22\u201325]. Development of existing technologies, especially increased read length, improves the quality of raw sequencing data and significantly reduces missing or erroneous SNPs caused by sequencing and assembling errors [25\u201327]. Therefore, theoretically a longer read length can produce higher quality raw data and influence downstream analyses [28\u201331], although no reports about the effects of read length on the accuracy of SNP discovery are available. Selection of a suitable assembler is also critical for SNP detection. For example, Jung\u2019s study on freshwater prawn showed that the results were seriously affected by the assemblers adopted, and an approach to obtain a comprehensive and reliable assembly was necessary [32]. The final SNP results were also affected by the SNP callers applied. For example, SNPs called individually from sequencing data from an Arabidopsis sup1ros1 ecotype by different tools (GeMS, SAMtools and GATK) led to distinct SNP accuracy rate in You\u2019s study [27]. A study about whole-genome sequencing of dairy cattle also showed that various SNP callers cause significant differences in the number of variants [33]. The SNP array at the whole-genome sequence level in chicken showed that appropriate SNP callers had high values in measures of SNPs especially for those with low allele frequency [24].At present, the best assembling and SNP calling software combination for achieving the most accurate SNP data on RNA-seq is not known. The access to SNP information on RNA-seq data is a formidable task limited by the availability of reliable SNP discovery methods including assembling and SNP calling pipeline to resolve the problems of genotyping errors and missing data. It is therefore crucial to establish a reliable strategy to overcome the limitations in RNA-seq for downstream SNP analyses.Woody fruit crops are propagated asexually and therefore have a genetic background of high heterozygosity and maintain a genetic resource of high diversity. In this study, two peach cultivars (\u2018Hujingmilu\u2019 with deep red appearance and \u2018Yulu\u2019 with barely pigmented appearance [34]) and two mandarin cultivars (\u2018Ponkan\u2019 with orange-reddish appearance and \u2018Yellowish-peeled Ponkan\u2019 with yellowish appearance [35]) were used for SNP detection. Since anthocyanins and carotenoids are characteristic pigments for ripe peach and mandarin, a study of the presence of SNPs in pigment biosynthesis genes can contribute to the understanding of the possible mechanisms for differential coloration in ripe fruit peel.Here transcriptome sequencing of two peach cultivars and two mandarin cultivars was completed and for peach, two paired-end read lengths was involved. The raw data were processed with five common assemblers and two SNP callers and predicted SNPs were generated. The predicted SNPs inside a number of selected genes of peach (genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis) and mandarin (genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis) were compared with authentic ones identified via PCR amplification, gene cloning and sequencing procedures. The effects of different paired-end read lengths, assemblers, and SNP callers on the accuracy of SNP results were investigated and it was found that SNPs can be accurately discovered by performing RNA-seq with a 150\u2009bp read length, assembling with Trinity and SNP calling with GATK. The study provides general guidelines for accurate SNP discovery from transcriptome data.Reads filtered, processed and assembled into contigs as described above were used for SNP discovery. To find an optimum assembly method for SNP detection purposes, the six libraries were analysed using five different de novo assemblers including Trinity, IDBA, oases, SOAPdenovo, Trans-abyss. Due to the different standards of contig length and N50 length applied by the five assemblers, different assembly outcomes were generated. The length of unigenes ranged from 200\u2009bp to 3000\u2009bp for all five assemblers. Taking Trinity as an example, clean reads from three libraries were assembled de novo into 106,574, 103,342, 167,580 transcripts with a mean size of 1545\u2009bp, and 44,470, 49,235, 66,148 unigenes with a mean size of 856\u2009bp, respectively (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S1). A summary of the detailed length distribution of transcripts and unigenes is listed in Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S1.The alignment results with six libraries using Trinity are shown in Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Table S2. Over 76% of total clean reads were mapped to associated unigenes in each library (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Table S2), suggesting that the quality of unigene data was high enough for subsequent SNP calling procedures. When the paired-end read length was 125\u2009bp, the percentages of multi-mapped reads were approximately 60% in both \u2018HJ\u2019 and \u2018YL\u2019 and that of uniq-mapped reads were around 40% (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Table S2). The percentages of multi-mapped reads declined dramatically to less than 30%, meanwhile, the percentages of uniq-mapped reads were significantly higher when the paired-end read length was 150\u2009bp (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Table S2). These data implied a strong influence of paired-end read length on read mapping quality.To explore which assembler and SNP caller were most suitable for accurately detecting SNPs, the SNPs predicted through transcriptomic analysis were compared with those obtained via PCR amplification followed by gene cloning and sequencing procedures. Five anthocyanin biosynthesis related genes in peach and nine carotenogenic genes in mandarin possessing putative SNPs as predicted by at least one combination of read length, assembler and SNP caller were selected. The authentic SNPs presented inside these genes were obtained following PCR, gene cloning and sequencing procedures (Additional\u00a0file\u00a04: Table S4 and Additional\u00a0file\u00a05: Table S5).The accuracy of SNP discovery in peach was compared between ten combinations of assemblers and SNP callers. Different read lengths under the same assemblers and SNP callers resulted in distinct results for the same samples. The accuracy of SNP discovery, represented by the higher percentage of true SNP discovered and a much lower percentage of false positive SNP predicted, was higher with a read length of 150\u2009bp compared to 125\u2009bp (Table\u00a02). For ten combinations, the average percentage of true SNP discovery was 50.25 and 39.25% respectively when the read lengths was 150\u2009bp and 125\u2009bp, while the percentage of false positive SNP discovery was 6.11 and 34.45% (Table\u00a02). Moreover, with a read length of 125\u2009bp, a combination with a higher accuracy was often accompanied by a higher error rate, e.g., Oases-GATK had the highest accuracy of 80.00%, but its error rate was also highest, up to 55.56% (Table\u00a02). There was no obvious correlation between the percentage of authentic SNP discovery and the percentage of false positive SNP discovery with read length 150\u2009bp (Table\u00a02). The accuracy of SNP discovery was also affected by the combinations of assemblers and SNP callers. When the read length was 150\u2009bp, the combination of Trinity and GATK produced the highest accuracy, i.e., 100% discovery of authentic SNP and no prediction of any false positive SNP (Table\u00a02). No combination with 100% accuracy was observed when the read length was 125\u2009bp, further indicating the importance of longer read length. For read length 150\u2009bp, no false positive SNP was predicted with four assemblers (with the single exception of IDBA) when the SNP caller GBS was taken. Compared with GATK, the high filtration standard of GBS reduced the error rate, but on the other side, missed a lot of authentic SNPs and the rate of true SNP discovery dropped to 15% with four assemblers and to 5% with the assembler Trans-abyss (Table\u00a02). For GATK, the accuracy with five assemblers reached 70% or above. However, only the combination Trinity-GATK reached 100% accuracy and no false positive SNP prediction, while IDBA-GATK had the lowest accuracy of 70% and trans-abyss-GATK had the highest false positive SNP rate of 13.16% (Table\u00a02). The study showed that not only SNP callers, but also assemblers had a strong influence on accuracy of SNP discovery from RNA-seq data.SNPs can be sorted into two types, including homozygous types for those SNPs presented between cultivars but not between two alleles of an individual cultivar, and heterozygous types for those SNPs presented between two alleles of an individual cultivar. As shown in Fig.\u00a02, the number of heterozygous SNPs is higher than homozygous ones in all four transcriptomes. For all SNPs found in peach cultivars \u2018HJ\u2019 and \u2018YL\u2019, respectively, 18,072 and 20,248 were heterozygous (HZ) while 15,166 and 12,617 were homozygous (HM), with an average HZ:HM proportion of 1.39:1 in peach. Over three times of SNPs were found in mandarin, compared with peach, and many more heterozygous SNPs (106,466 and 104,732) were found than homozygous SNPs (12,213 and 13,311) with an averaged HZ:HM proportion of 8.29:1 in mandarin (Fig.\u00a02).For the heterozygous SNPs in all four transcriptomes, fewer transversion substitutions (four possibilities, 38.33 to 40.05%) were found than transitions substitution (two possibilities, 59.95 to 61.67%) (Additional\u00a0file\u00a010: Figure S2). Transition substitutions significantly outnumbered the transversion substitutions by almost a factor of 2 (Additional\u00a0file\u00a010: Figure S2). Nearly even distribution between two variation types of transitions (G/A, C/T), and to a lesser extent, between four variation types of transversion (C/A, C/G, T/G, T/A), are observed for the \u2018HJ\u2019 transcriptome (Additional\u00a0file\u00a010: Figure S2). Similar results were found with the other three transcriptomes. Moreover, the distribution patterns of substitution types were also similar between peach and mandarin (Additional\u00a0file\u00a010: Figure S2), indicating presence of a conserved mechanism during evolution.RNA-seq dataset and following SNP discovery often differ due to sequencing quality as affected by the read length, sequencing depth and sequencing platforms as well as various downstream analyses [13, 14, 28]. In this study, our data suggested that the accuracy of SNP discovery was affected by paired-end read lengths, assemblers and SNP callers. Previously the effect of read length on accuracy of SNP discovery has not reported, although it was suggested that a higher read length can improve the quality of NGS raw data [31]. Here our data indicated that the longer read length is necessary for high quality SNP discovery. More SNPs were found with 125\u2009bp sequencing, but with higher rate of incorrect prediction compared with 150\u2009bp sequencing, resulting in greatly reduced accuracy with the shorter reads. The reasons for more false positive SNPs predicted from 125\u2009bp sequencing can be attributed mainly to a slightly higher sequencing error and an obviously higher rate of incorrect read mapping. As shown in Table\u00a01, the sequencing error rate (N%) for HJ-125\u2009bp, YL-125\u2009bp was 0.01% while those for HJ-150\u2009bp, YL-150\u2009bp and PK-150\u2009bp YP-150\u2009bp were 0.00%. Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Table S2 showed a lower rate of uniq-mapped Reads and a higher rate of multi-mapped Reads for 125\u2009bp sequencing. Mapping to multiple positions can cause erroneous SNPs. Differences between results from different assemblers were observed as well and these can be attributed to the different methods for dealing with sequencing errors, resolving inconsistencies and using paired-end information [32]. Different assemblers vary in the details of usability (ability of installation and execution, speed) and assembly quality (the contiguity and the accuracy), which determine how they resolve errors and inconsistencies in the dataset, leading to distinct assembly performance [14]. Therefore, a suitable assembler is critical in order to improve the quality and performance of de novo assembly. The third factor affecting SNP discovery we found in this study is SNP caller. It was found that each SNP caller has its own characteristics and limitations. For example, although GBS, a stringent SNP caller, can efficiently avoid false SNPs, it easily results in omission because of its limitations such as genotyping errors, missing data and the under-calling of heterozygous sites. The study here revealed the merits and defects of two paired-end read lengths, five assemblers and two SNP callers for SNP analysis, and provide detailed comparison of different methods for reference.Peach and mandarin are fruit crops propagated asexually and therefore the presence of a high number of heterozygous SNPs (Fig.\u00a02) is not unexpected. The genetic heterogeneity of an organism can be represented by the rate of heterozygous SNP in the genome, and can also, to a large extent, be revealed in the transcriptome as well. The rate of heterozygous SNP among transcriptomes, calculated by dividing the number of heterozygous SNPs with the total length of unigenes (presented in Additional file 2: Table S2), was 0.045 and 0.202% respectively for peach and mandarin. The high rate of heterozygous SNPs in 'PK' and 'YP' mandarins suggested that these two mandarins are not pure mandarins. This is consistent with the recent findings that 'PK' is an early-admixture mandarin containing a small amount of pummelo admixture [36]. Besides, it was found more heterozygous SNPs presented as transition substitutions than transversion substitutions (Additional\u00a0file\u00a010: Figure S2). This is in consistent with the conclusions that transition mutations, caused by the hypermutability effects of CpG dinucleotide sites and deamination of methylated cytosines, are the most frequent class of SNPs in both plant and animal genomes [37].SNP\u00a0is extensively used as a\u00a0molecular marker for analysing genotype and trait association as well as assisting breeding. Traditional SNP mining techniques are generally low throughput and technically complicated. High efficient SNP discovery become possible in recent decades due to the availability of huge raw data from next generation sequencing. Although several assemblers and SNP callers have been used in previous literatures, the accuracy was rarely evaluated and the optimum combination of assembler and SNP caller is not clear. In addition, the effect of paired-end read length of sequencing on the accuracy of SNP discovery has not been reported. Here we evaluated the accuracy of SNP discovery from combinations of two paired-end read lengths, five assemblers, and two SNP callers, and established an ideal strategy, i.e., obtaining sequencing raw data from 150\u2009bp paired-end read length, assembling with Trinity and SNP calling with GATK, for SNP discovery. This strategy was proven to be 100% accurate for a total of 280 authentic SNPs analysed, while none of the other strategies reached 100% accuracy. The evaluation was carried out with transcriptome data from peel tissues of two peach cultivars and two mandarin cultivars, but the strategy should also be applicable to other organisms and tissues. With the advantages of high throughput, high accuracy, low cost, and especially, being independent of a reference genome, the method established here can be expected to be widely used for SNP discovery in genetic diversity analysis, breeding and genome-wide association studies.Ripe fruit and young leaves of \u2018Hujingmilu\u2019 (\u2018HJ\u2019) and \u2018Yulu\u2019 (\u2018YL\u2019) peach [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch] as well as \u2018Ponkan\u2019 (\u2018PK\u2019) and \u2018Yellowish-peeled Ponkan\u2019 (\u2018YP\u2019) mandarin (Citrus reticulata Blanco) were collected at the Fenghua Peach Research Institute and Quzhou Fruit Science Institute, Zhejiang, China, respectively. All these materials are commercial cultivars with voucher specimens available in the above-mentioned institutes. Peach cultivars \u2018YL\u2019 and \u2018HJ\u2019 were identified by Yin-chong Zhang in 1883 and A-pan Shao in 1964, respectively [38]. \u2018PK\u2019 mandarin is a natural cultivar with a history of over a hundred years and first identifier unknown. \u2018YP\u2019 mandarin was identified by Quzhou Bureau of Agriculture Economic Specialty Station in 2008 [35]. The peel tissues, after separation from the fruit, and the young leaves were frozen in liquid nitrogen on the day of collection and stored at \u2212\u200980\u2009\u00b0C for further DNA or RNA extraction.Young leaves were ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen and the genomic DNA was isolated using an improved CTAB method [39]. Peel tissues were also ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen and the total RNA was isolated by a CTAB protocol as described by Shan [40] and treated with DNA-free DNA Removal kit (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, CA, USA) to remove DNA contamination. The concentrations of RNA samples were assessed by Qubit (Life Technologies, CA, USA). RNA purity was estimated with the NanoPhotometer\u00ae spectrophotometer (IMPLEN, CA, USA) and integrity was evaluated by the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA).The library construction and transcriptome sequencing was carried out by staff at Biomarker (Beijing, China). In brief, the library was constructed following mRNA enrichment, mRNA fragmentation, second strand cDNA synthesis, adaptor ligation, size selection, PCR amplification and transcriptome sequencing. The sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq\u2122 2500 and 4000 platform and paired-end reads were generated. Paired-end read lengths of 125\u2009bp and 150\u2009bp were used for peach cultivars and the length 150\u2009bp for mandarin cultivars. All raw data (raw reads) obtained were further processed through filtering parameters. After removing reads containing adapter or ploy-N and low-quality reads (Q-value \u226410) from raw data, high-quality clean data (clean reads) collected in FASTQ format were used for subsequent analyses. Clean data was further analysed to obtain Q20, Q30, GC content and sequence duplication level for quality control.Five prevalent assemblers, i.e., Trinity, IDBA, oases, SOAPdenovo, Trans-abyss, were applied in all six transcriptome for de novo assembly. All of the generated unigenes were subjected to match against (E-value \u22641.0e-5) public databases (Nr, Swiss-Prot, KEGG, COG, GO) and annotation information was retrieved. The clean reads exported in FASTQ format were aligned to unigenes through STAR software. Subsequently two widely used SNP callers, i.e., GATK and GBS, were applied to perform prediction of SNP site. Reads were processed with a further filtering step under GATK and GBS filter parameters (read depth no less than 10, quality score no less than 20, consecutive single base errors no more than 3 in 35\u2009bp, FS 20.0 window 25). Only SNPs after sequential depth standardization with quality value >\u20092 were retained. With all programs mentioned, the study resulted in ten different variant calling strategies: Trinity_GATK, IDBA_GATK, oases_GATK, SOAPdenovo_GATK, Trans-abyss_GATK and Trinity_GBS, IDBA_GBS, oases_GBS, SOAPdenovo_GBS, Trans-abyss_GBS. All SNPs were analysed within cultivars and then compared between cultivars. A simplified workflow of assembly and SNP calling is outlined in Fig.\u00a01.Genes related to anthocyanin biosynthesis in peach and carotenoid biosynthesis in mandarin were evaluated and the genes containing putative SNP, predicted by at least one variant calling strategy, were chosen for SNP identification through PCR amplification and gene cloning procedures [41]. Briefly, with Faststart High Fidelity PCR system (Roche, SUI), each PCR reaction mixture (25\u2009\u03bcL total volume) contained 20\u2009ng genomic DNA, 0.2\u2009\u03bcM of each PCR primer (10\u2009\u03bcM, Additional\u00a0file\u00a011: Table S9), 0.1\u2009mM dNTPs, PCR buffer and 0.25 unit of DNA polymerase. PCR was performed with the following cycling conditions: 95\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009min and 35\u2009cycles of 95\u2009\u00b0C for 30s, 58\u2009\u00b0C for 30s, and 72\u2009\u00b0C for 60s/kb, followed by a final elongation step of 72\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. The PCR products were cloned into pGEM\u00ae-T Easy (Promega, USA), and for each gene, at least 15 recombinant plasmids were sequenced and sequence alignment was carried out with Seqman.Anthocyanidin synthaseBeta-carotene 3-hydroxylase 1Beta-carotene 3-hydroxylase 3Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1Chalcone synthaseThe clusters of orthologous groups of proteins databaseCapsorubin synthaseDihydroflavonol 4-reductaseGenome Analysis ToolkitGenotyping-by-sequencingGene Ontology enrichment databaseHujingmiluThe Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes databaseLycopene\u03b2-cyclaseNational center for biotechnology informationNext-generation sequencingNCBI non-redundant databasePonkanPhytoene synthase 1Phytoene synthase 2RNA-sequencingSingle nucleotide polymorphismsSwiss-Prot protein databaseUDP-glucose: flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransfersaeViolaxanthin de-epoxidaseYuluYellowish-peeled PonkanZeaxanthin epoxidaseThis study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation in China (31572102), the Zhejiang Provincial Science and Technology Project for the Belt and Road (2016C04001) and the 111 project (B17039).

Paired-end read lengths of 125\u2009bp and 150\u2009bp were applied to peach and 150\u2009bp to mandarin. A summary of the sequencing statistics is shown in Table\u00a01. A total of 40.7\u2009G data, on average 6.7\u2009G data for each library, were obtained. A collection of over 20 million high-quality clean reads were obtained from each library with the Q20\u2009>\u200992% (Table\u00a01). Quality Score showed the corresponding incorrect base calling in each library was less than 0.01%. The GC dinucleotide content was over 44%. After pre-processing filtering of low-quality sequences and adaptor trimming, high quality sequencing reads that passed thresholds were assembled for further SNP discovery analysis.Table 1\nSummary of the sequencing data of \u2018Hujingmilu\u2019 (\u2018HJ\u2019) and \u2018Yulu\u2019 (\u2018YL\u2019) peach and \u2018Ponkan\u2019 (\u2018PK\u2019) and \u2018Yellowish-peeled Ponkan\u2019 (\u2018YP\u2019) mandarin libraries with either 125\u2009bp or 150\u2009bp paired-end read lengths\nAs illustrated in Fig.\u00a01, two SNP callers (GATK and GBS) were applied to analyse RNA-seq data for SNP discovery following assembly with five different assemblers. We processed SNP calling under parameters described in the Methods section to maximize reliable SNPs and minimize omissions and false-positive SNPs. After calling peach and mandarin transcriptome data with GATK and GBS, predicted SNPs were recorded. Depending on the paired-end read lengths, and the assemblers and SNP callers employed, 7752\u201356,271 and 43,944\u2013127,201 SNPs were found residing in peach and mandarin transcriptomes, respectively (Additional\u00a0file\u00a03: Table S3). Comparing data from two SNP calling methods, GATK showed a significantly (1.2\u20133.5 times) higher number of SNP than GBS in all libraries from five assemblers employed (Additional\u00a0file\u00a03: Table S3). The data from two paired-end read lengths (125\u2009bp and 150\u2009bp) in peach were compared and it was found that the number of SNP predicted with the same assembler and SNP caller was affected by read lengths. For four assemblers, except for oases, the number of SNPs predicted was higher when the read length was 125\u2009bp (Additional\u00a0file\u00a03: Table S3). Irrespective of the read lengths and SNP callers employed, the minimum number of SNPs was generated with assembler IDBA_tran for both peach and mandarin (Additional\u00a0file\u00a03: Table S3).\n\nFig. 1\nA simplified workflow of analysis strategies for RNA-seq and SNP discovery. The clip arts are drawn with PowerPoint 2010\nA total of 40 authentic SNPs were identified in the five anthocyanin biosynthesis related genes (CHS, DFR, ANS, UFGT and WD40\u20131) of peach (Additional file 4: Table S4), and the number of SNPs predicted through different combinations of assemblers and SNP callers for transcriptome analysis as well as the accuracy are summarized in Table\u00a02. Five assemblers and two SNP callers were applied in this study, which made up ten combinations in total. All these combinations were applied to transcriptomic data from paired-end read lengths of 125\u2009bp and 150\u2009bp, respectively, and an overview of raw data for targeted genes listed in Additional\u00a0file\u00a06: Table S6 and Additional\u00a0file\u00a07: Table S7.Table 2\nAccuracy of SNP predictions from ten combinations of assemblers and SNP callers with 40 authentic SNPs presented in five anthocyanin biosynthesis related genes in peach as example.

Nine carotenogenic genes (ZEP, PSY1, PSY2, BCH1, BCH3, VDE, LCYB, CYCB, CCD1) were chosen to validate. A total of 240 authentic SNPs were identified, via PCR amplification and gene cloning and sequencing strategy (Additional file 5: Table S5), and the SNPs predicted, via bioinformatic strategy, are listed in Additional\u00a0file\u00a08: Table S8. A summary of the number of SNPs predicted through different combinations of assemblers and SNP callers for transcriptome analysis as well as the accuracy were summarized in Table\u00a03. Similar to the findings on peach, only the combination of Trinity with GATK produced 100% accuracy in the mandarin case, followed by trans-abyss-GATK with an accuracy rate of 80.42% (Table\u00a03). Among all SNP discovery strategies, the GBS caller always filtered out a lot of true SNPs and the rate of true SNP discovered was substantially inferior to GATK. This is consistent with the findings from peach data analysis. In summary, the combination of Trinity with GATK was the best strategy for SNP discovery, obtaining 100% accuracy in peach and mandarin when the read length was 150\u2009bp, and this strategy might be applicable to wide range of plants and other organisms.Table 3\nAccuracy of SNP predictions from ten combinations of assemblers and SNP callers with 240 authentic SNPs presented in nine carotenogenic genes in mandarin as example. The RNA-Seq was performed under the read length of 150\u2009bp\nAs described above, using the combination of Trinity with GATK and with a read length of 150\u2009bp, SNPs in transcriptome data of peach and mandarin can be accurately discovered. Here, with such strategy, further characterization of SNPs was performed in the four transcriptomes from two peach cultivars and two mandarin cultivars. The numbers of SNPs predicted is shown in Fig.\u00a02. The number of total SNPs varied only slightly, less than 1.2%, between two cultivars, but was relatively greater between two species, with the number being 2.58 times higher in mandarin than in peach. Overall, the SNP density in mandarin was higher than in peach (Additional\u00a0file\u00a09: Figure S1).\n\nFig. 2\nThe numbers of heterozygous (purple) and homozygous (cyan) SNPs discovered in peach (cv.

(DOCX 17 kb)", "s12864-019-5561-0": "Small RNAs (sRNAs) are short non-coding RNA molecules (20\u201330\u2009nt) that regulate gene expression at transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels in many eukaryotic organisms, through a mechanism known as RNA interference (RNAi). Recent studies have highlighted that they are also involved in cross-kingdom communication: sRNAs can move across the contact surfaces from \u201cdonor\u201d to \u201creceiver\u201d organisms and, once in the host cells of the receiver, they can target specific mRNAs, leading to a modulation of host metabolic pathways and defense responses. Very little is known about RNAi mechanism and sRNAs occurrence in Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF), an important component of the plant root microbiota that provide several benefits to host plants, such as improved mineral uptake and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress.Taking advantage of the available genomic resources for the AMF Rhizophagus irregularis we described its putative RNAi machinery, which is characterized by a single Dicer-like (DCL) gene and an unusual expansion of Argonaute-like (AGO-like) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene families. In silico investigations of previously published transcriptomic data and experimental assays carried out in this work provided evidence of gene expression for most of the identified sequences. Focusing on the symbiosis between R. irregularis and the model plant Medicago truncatula, we characterized the fungal sRNA population, highlighting the occurrence of an active sRNA-generating pathway and the presence of microRNA-like sequences. In silico analyses, supported by host plant degradome data, revealed that several fungal sRNAs have the potential to target M. truncatula transcripts, including some specific mRNA already shown to be modulated in roots upon AMF colonization.The identification of RNAi-related genes, together with the characterization of the sRNAs population, suggest that R. irregularis is equipped with a functional sRNA-generating pathway. Moreover, the in silico analysis predicted 237 plant transcripts as putative targets of specific fungal sRNAs suggesting that cross-kingdom post-transcriptional gene silencing may occur during AMF colonization.Rhizophagus irregularis is a model system for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF); it belongs to Glomeromycotina [1], a group of soil fungi able to form a mutualistic symbiosis with the majority of land plants. AMF fungi facilitate the supply of water and nutrients to host plants in return of fixed carbon [2]. However, the beneficial effects of the AM symbiosis go beyond an improved mineral nutrition and includes enhanced tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress [3].A long history of co-evolution characterizes this unique plant-fungus association where the typical highly branched fungal structures (arbuscules), which develop inside cortical cells, represent a clear sign of the occurrence of fine-tuned regulatory circuits in both partners. Such an intimate colonization of plant tissues relies on an efficient molecular communication system, which occurs before the contact, and on extensive structural and metabolic rearrangements on both plant and fungal sides, which have been only partially described [2, 4]. Transcriptomic studies, mainly focused on plant protein-encoding genes, have been instrumental to describe the molecular reprogramming that the AMF colonization induces in different host plants not only locally (roots; [5\u20137]) but also systemically (shoot and fruit; [8, 9]) level. Nevertheless, investigations on transcript profiles have been performed to a lower extent also on the AMF [10].Regulation of gene expression relies on several factors related to transcriptional, post-transcriptional and translational events. The most recently characterized level of regulation relies on the RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism and involves small RNAs (sRNAs): they are short non coding RNA molecules (20\u201330\u2009nt) that can act at transcriptional or post-transcriptional level in many eukaryotic organisms [11, 12]. Basic enzymatic components of the RNAi response are an RNAse III protein, Dicer, that produces sRNAs from double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) and an Argonaute (AGO) protein, that uses these sRNAs to guide the selective and sequence-specific degradation, translational inhibition or transcriptional repression of the target [13]. An RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is also used in some organisms (nematodes, fungi and plants) to generate dsRNAs from aberrant RNAs and to amplify the silencing signal [13].The main function initially ascribed to RNAi was the protection of the genome against transposons and exogenous sequences such as invading viruses or transgenes [12]. Later, it became clear that RNAi is also involved in the production of a variety of endogenous sRNAs, which participate, through the control of gene expression, in the regulation of several endogenous biological functions through the control of gene expression [12].In the 1990s pioneering studies on the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa were seminal to describe the phenomenon of RNAi in fungi [14]. Since then, investigations on RNAi components and sRNAs populations have been carried out on other fungi and indicated that many of them possess functional sRNAs while some species, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Ustilago maydis, lost their RNAi capability [15, 16]. Furthermore, studies on fungal models and plant pathogens have shown that fungi may possess different classes of sRNAs, which are produced by multiple Dicer-dependent and Dicer-independent RNAi pathways [13]. Fungi are thus emerging fascinating systems to study RNAi-related processes and, because of their key position in the eukaryotic tree of life, they could provide insights on the evolution and diversification of RNAi.Interestingly, recent investigations have highlighted that sRNAs are also involved in cross-kingdom communication [17\u201325]. In particular, concerning the interactions between plants-fungal pathogens or plants-parasitic plants, sRNAs can move across the contact surface, from \u201cdonor\u201d to \u201creceiver\u201d organisms. Once in the host cells, sRNAs can target specific host mRNAs, sometimes triggering secondary sRNA production and thus leading to a modulation of host metabolic pathways and defense responses [26\u201328]. In case of parasitic/pathogenic organisms these findings are of great interest in light of the development of innovative crop defense strategies [23, 24, 29].Currently very little is known about AMF RNAi machinery [30] and whether AMF possess a population of functional sRNAs. Furthermore, nothing is known about possible sRNAs trafficking and reciprocal sRNA-mediated communication between AMF and host plants. HIGS (host-induced gene silencing) and VIGS (virus induced gene silencing) have been shown to be successful tools for gene silencing in AMF [31\u201334] suggesting that RNA movement from the host to the fungus indeed occurs and RNAi-related mechanisms are active in AMF. In addition, it has been recently reported that several plant microRNAs are differentially expressed during the AM symbiosis [35\u201339]; although their functional roles remain widely unclear, some of them could represent potential candidate mobile sRNAs.Aim of this work was to characterize the essential components of the RNA-mediated gene silencing machinery in the AMF R. irregularis, taking advantage of a newly published genome assembly [40]), and to characterize the population of R. irregularis sRNAs from extraradical mycelium and symbiotic tissues. We demonstrated that R. irregularis possesses key components of the RNAi machinery characterized by an unusual expansion of AGO-like (Argonaute-like) and RdRp gene families; furthermore, AMF sRNAs share structural properties with previously analyzed fungal sRNA datasets, including microRNA-like sequences. Finally, we identified in silico a list of predicted fungal sRNA-plant host mRNA target pairs possibly involved in cross-kingdom post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) regulation during AMF colonization.A survey of recently published genomic resources of the AMF R. irregularis [40] was performed to identify proteins belonging to the core eukaryotic RNAi machinery: Dicer-like (DCL), AGO and RdRp [13]. By keywords searches on JGI MycCosm portal [41], we found 1 DCL, 40 AGO-like and 21 RdRp putative homologous proteins that responded to the following criteria: the presence of two RNAse III domains for DCL [42], the presence of a piwi domain for AGO-like proteins, the presence of an RdRp domain for the RdRp [43]. A blastp search on the predicted R. irregularis proteome, using characterized DCL, AGO and RdRp from other fungi (the closely related Mucor circinelloides and the RNAi model systems Neurospora crassa and Cryphonectria parasitica) as queries, resulted in the same number of sequences obtained by keywords searches.The AGO gene family is divided in three paralogous groups: a widespread AGO-like group found in plants, animals and fungi, a Piwi-like group closely related to Drosophila melanogaster PIWI (P-element Induced Wimpy Testis) only found in animals, and a species-specific group (group 3 AGO) only found in Caenorhabditis elegans [46]. Interestingly, the genome of C. elegans also displays the highest level of AGO gene expansion so far reported (26 total genes; [46]). Considering that a similar degree of expansion is also observed in R. irregularis, we wondered if some of the identified R. irregularis AGO-like proteins were related with those of the animal Piwi-like group or with the ones specific of the C. elegans group 3. For this purpose, a phylogenetic tree derived including D. melanogaster, C. elegans and Arabidopsis thaliana AGO did not reveal any homologous of group 3 AGO (those specific of C. elegans) or of Piwi-like AGO in R. irregularis (Additional file 1: Figure S1).We wondered if a similar occurrence of RNAi-related genes is noticeable in other AMF. In the recently published Rhizophagus clarus proteome [47] we found 2 putative DCL, 33 putative AGO-like and 17 putative RdRp. Phylogenetic analyses of R. clarus AGO-like, RdRp and DCL proteins revealed that they are strictly related with those of R. irregularis (Additional file 1: Figure S3).To characterize the R. irregularis sRNA population, we sequenced, with an Illumina platform, 9 sRNAs libraries prepared from biological samples in different conditions of the R. irregularis - M. truncatula symbiotic association: 3 from extraradical mycelium (ERM; fungal structures developing outside the roots after colonization), 3 from mycorrhizal roots from which we removed the extraradical mycelium (RM) and 3 from non mycorrhizal roots (RC). The presence of a functional AM symbiosis in RM samples was confirmed by qRT-PCR assays using primers for the plant AMF-inducible phosphate transporter gene (MtPT4) (Additional file 1: Figure S4).The evaluation of read length distribution is a useful tool to assess whether sRNAs are originated through a specific molecular pathway [48], i.e. in a Dicer-dependent manner. Plant reads present in RM and RC libraries displayed a typical enrichment of 21 and 24\u2009nt-long sequences [37, 49], with the 21\u2009nt-long class consisting of more redundant sequences than the 24\u2009nt-long class (Additional file 1: Figure S5). On the contrary, the length distribution of sRNA reads from ERM and RM libraries mapping on the fungal genome (R. irregularis sRNAs\u2009=\u2009Rir-sRNAs) was bimodal with a first peak at 24\u2009nt and 26\u2009nt in RM and ERM respectively, and a second peak at 31\u201332-33\u2009nt in both samples; the 31\u201333\u2009nt long reads consist of extremely redundant sequences (Fig.\u00a05b).The analysis of the 5\u2032 terminal nucleotide composition of fungal non redundant reads showed that approximately half of the sRNAs shorter than 26\u2009nt starts with uracil (Additional file 1: Figure S6). Interestingly, in plants, 5\u2032 U enrichment has been associated to the selective loading of sRNAs to specific AGO proteins [50]. The features of these sRNAs, together with the identification of RNAi-related genes, suggest the presence of an active sRNAs-generating pathway in R. irregularis.Rir-sRNAs from RM and ERM libraries were used for a genome-guided sRNA-generating loci discovery and characterization, by ShortStack software [51]. Setting a cut-off of 10 RPM (reads per million reads), 2131 sRNA-generating loci, defined by the 95% of Rir-sRNAs, were predicted (whole characterization data in Additional file 4). Thirty three percent (702) of Rir-sRNA-generating loci localized in intergenic regions while the remaining 67% (1429) shared, for at least one nucleotide, the same genomic coordinates of annotated genes (protein-coding genes). We observed that 69% of Rir-sRNAs-generating loci overlapping with annotated genes produced sRNAs from the same strand of the overlapped genes, 8% from the opposite strand while 7%, despite being located on a specific genomic strand, were localized in regions coding for genes on both strands (so we could not assess if they are sense or anti-sense to genes). The remaining 16% of loci produced sRNAs on both genomic strands. These observations are in line with the results obtained for M. circinelloides, where exons were the major source of sRNAs [43]. Differential expression analysis, performed with DESeq2 [52], revealed that 225 Rir-sRNAs-generating loci were up-regulated in terms of sRNAs production in ERM while 589 of them were up-regulated in RM; the remaining 1317 loci were not regulated between the two conditions (Additional file 1: Figure S7A).Considering that transposable elements are an important source for sRNA production [12], we looked for similarity of Rir-sRNA-generating loci with fungal repetitive elements from RepBase 23.04 [53]. A total of 236 loci, representing the 11% of the identified loci, had strong similarity with transposons: 93 with DNA transposons, 61 with LTR retrotransposons and 22 with non-LTR retrotransposons. Rir-sRNAs mapping on these loci were enriched in 24\u2009nt long sequences (Additional file 1: Figure S8).Interestingly, the two clusters differentiated also on the basis of the genomic positions of the Rir-sRNA-generating loci relative to protein-encoding annotated genes (Fig.\u00a06c) and on the basis of the expression levels of the loci between ERM and RM conditions (Fig.\u00a06d). In fact, 94% of Rir-sRNA-generating loci from cluster 1 localized in genic regions and 15 and 1% were up-regulated in ERM and RM, respectively, while 37% of loci from cluster 2 localized in genic regions and 1 and 66% were up-regulated in ERM and RM, respectively.Finally, we observed that 4 and 16% of loci from cluster 1 and cluster 2 respectively showed homology with sequences in RepBase (21 DNA transposons, 12 LTR retrotransposons and 7 non-LTR retrotransposons for cluster 1; 69 DNA transposons, 46 LTR retrotransposons and 15 non-LTR retrotransposons for cluster 2).Considering that cross-kingdom RNA silencing seems to be a quite common and widespread phenomenon [17, 21, 25], we searched for in silico evidences of M. truncatula mRNAs (Mtr-mRNAs) potentially targeted by Rir-sRNAs. We combined our sRNA-seq results with degradome (PARE-seq) data collected in similar experimental conditions for the M. truncatula-R. irregularis symbiotic association (mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal roots; [37]). For this purpose, we pooled together all the Rir-sRNAs from ERM and RM libraries and counted, for each individual sequence, the number of total occurrences. The 11,396 most abundant Rir-sRNAs (expression ranges from 1,945,411 reads for the most abundant Rir-sRNA to 19 reads for the less abundant) were used for target prediction against M. truncatula transcriptome followed by PARE validation using sPARTA [56].Resulting targets were further filtered maintaining only the predictions that met the three following criteria: Rir-sRNA size between 21 and 24\u2009nt (considering that plant sRNAs involved in RNAi are 21\u201324\u2009nt long; [57]), adjusted p-value less than 0.05, at least 5 PARE reads at cleavage site in mycorrhizal condition and no reads at the same site in non-mycorrhizal one (to limit the search to cleavage signals specific for mycorrhizal condition).This analysis identified 310 Rir-sRNA - Mtr-mRNA interactions involving 237 Mtr-mRNA and 274 Rir-sRNA (Additional file 5). These Rir-sRNAs were mainly produced by Rir-sRNA-generating loci up-regulated in RM condition (120), while the remaining corresponded to loci up-regulated in ERM condition (19) or not regulated (47) (Additional file 1: Figure S7B); 4 Rir-sRNAs originated from genome regions not annotated as Rir-sRNA-generating loci (Additional file 5). Putative targeted Mtr-mRNAs were enriched in 8 gene ontology (GO) terms: serine hydrolase activity (GO:0017171) and serine-type peptidase activity (GO:0008236) for the \u201cmolecular function\u201d ontology, while cytoplasm (GO:0005737), Golgi apparatus (GO:0005794), Golgi apparatus part (GO:0044431), Golgi membrane (GO:0000139), cytoplasmic part (GO:0044444) and endomembrane system (GO:0012505) for the \u201ccellular components\u201d ontology.To understand if the Mtr-mRNAs potentially targeted by Rir-sRNAs can also be targeted by endogenous plant sRNAs, we performed a target prediction and PARE validation against M. truncatula transcriptome using as queries the M. truncatula miRNAs (Mtr-miRNAs) (miRBase, Release 22, [58]). Considering only the predictions with adjusted p-value less than 0.05 and at least 5 PARE reads at cleavage sites in mycorrhizal condition, we identified 296 Mtr-miRNA / Mtr-mRNA interactions involving 172 Mtr-miRNAs and 165 Mtr-mRNAs (Additional file 6). According to our criteria, eleven Mtr-mRNAs were potentially targeted by both Rir-sRNAs and Mtr-miRNAs (AES68798, AES68809, AES88206, AES68814, AES74320, AES92729, AES98787, AET00614, KEH18078, KEH21177 and KEH27629) (Additional file 7).Plant miRNAs (generally the 22\u2009nt-long ones) can trigger secondary phased small interfering RNAs (siRNA) production from their target transcripts [59]. Such a phenomenon was also observed for some Cuscuta campestris miRNAs involved in host-gene regulation by cross-kingdom RNA silencing [28]. To understand whether Rir-sRNAs can trigger secondary siRNA production from their in silico predicted Mtr-mRNA targets, we followed the approach proposed by Sahid et al. (2018) [28]. After mapping sRNA reads from RM and RC libraries on M. truncatula transcriptome, we performed a differential expression analysis that resulted in 575 Mtr-mRNAs with an increased number of mapped sRNAs from RM libraries compared to RC ones (Additional file 8). Seven out of these 575 transcripts belong to the group of 237 Mtr-mRNAs previously identified as putative targets for Rir-sRNAs (AES67976, AES71586, AES75437, AES94149, AET03346, KEH31350 and KEH43815). According to PhaseTank, none of them produced phased siRNAs [60].AMF are nowadays recognized as a crucial component of the beneficial plant microbiota. Although their nature of obligate biotrophs has been an important obstacle for their molecular characterization, recent advances in \u2018omics techniques have allowed to obtain important insights on their biology and evolution [61]. The availability of genome sequences and transcriptomic data covering different fungal life stages gave us the opportunity to study a still unexplored aspect of AMF, that is the prediction of the existence of the RNAi machinery, a key platform for endogenous gene regulation and a possible source of cross-kingdom RNA silencing [10, 40, 47, 62, 63].By means of blastp- and keywords-based searches, we identified 1 DCL, 40 AGO-like and 21 putative RdRp protein homologues in the genomic resources of the AMF R. irregularis [40]. Fungi typically possess only 1\u20132 DCL, 1\u20134 AGO and 1\u20134 RdRp [64], therefore, this high number of AGO-like and RdRp coding genes is unusual. The comparison with the phylogenetically closely related R. clarus helped in pointing out the level of conservation among the different AGO, RdRp and DCL proteins.Interestingly, beside the canonical DCL protein Lee et al. (2018) identified in R. irregularis two additional prokaryotic (class I) ribonuclease III proteins (RIRNC2 and RIRNC3) that may arise by putative horizontal gene transfer events from cyanobacteria [30]. It would be interesting to understand whether these two proteins are also functional in the processing of dsRNA.Concerning AGO, we identified 7 AGO-like proteins that consist of small proteins (peptides) containing only the piwi domain, and that therefore are likely not functional as the AGO protein generally involved in sRNA processing in fungi. Nevertheless, at least the genes encoding for 4 of them (1479276, 1848686, 1489847 and 1580797) are expressed at sufficiently high levels (Additional file 2) to hypothesize that they are indeed functional, possibly belonging to a new class of non-AGO but piwi domain-containing small peptides, with no evident conserved correspondence into the predicted R. clarus proteome. Since functional fungal AGO involved in RNAi have at least 5 or 6 domains (see Fig.\u00a02), we can conclude that R. irregularis may possess 25 complete AGO. Among them, 5 (61334, 1606291, 1456683, 1478504, 1478501) do not have specific homologs in the R. clarus genome, thus representing a species-specific subclade; however, at the moment there is no evidence of corresponding expressed sequences in transcriptomic databases (Additional file 2).Comparing both Rhizophagus species and M. circinelloides, our AGO phylogenetic analysis reveals another interesting aspect: both Rhizophagus species have a group of 5\u20136 AGO-like proteins that are in a clade with well-characterized AGO from ascomycetes, whereas M. circinelloides seem to have lost such AGO. The three M. circinelloides AGO are in a well-supported clade with 25 AGO-like proteins from Rhizophagus displaying a specific AMF expansion of such AGO-like clade. Wider comparisons that include AGO from other eukaryotic kingdoms (plants and animals in specific) help to exclude that any of the fungal AGO are homologues of the PIWI-AGO present in insects (piwi and aubergine from Drosophila melanogaster) and point to a specific expansion of AMF specific AGO-like protein clade, well separated from plant and animal AGO.Regarding RdRp, the discrepancy in the number of RdRp between our work and Lee et al. (2018) -21 vs 3- is likely due to the different criteria used to identify RdRp: while we looked for proteins showing the presence of an RdRp domain, Lee et al. (2018) used rather restrictive parameters to find homologs of RdRp proteins characterized from other fungi (but excluding other RdRp more specific of AMF fungi) [30]. Indeed, following our approach, a similar number of RdRp (17) were also found in the R. clarus predicted proteome confirming the conservation of this group of AMF-specific and RdRp motif- containing proteins.In analogy to what happens with AGO-like, at least 6, out of the 21 identified, are constituted of small peptides that have only the conserved RdRp domains (1730125, 1645192, 1568118, 1770404, 1568116, and 1692915): in this case, all 6 are consistently expressed in transcriptome datasets, and one of them has a specific homologue in R. clarus. Also in this case, we can hypothesize the existence of a number of functional RdRp domain-carrying small proteins, so far undescribed in other fungi.In the case of the phylogenetic tree that includes plant RdRp, it is apparent that orthologues of AMF, fungal and plants are present, and only a subset of RdRp are specific for AMF (Additional file 1: Figure S2).Overall, the expansion of AMF-specific AGO-like and RdRp protein gene families prevents us from drawing any conclusion based on functional homology to animal, fungal or plant proteins containing the same conserved domains. In this respect, we can hypothesize that some of these proteins are not involved in RNAi or RNA silencing pathways, but might have a completely new set of functions even unrelated to RNA processing. Expansion of gene families is often accompanied by functional differentiation and gene expression fine-tuning. In this respect, it is tempting to correlate AGO-like and RdRp expansion in AMF to their large genomes, rich in repetitive DNA, mainly transposable elements. This expansion could be the result of a co-evolution between specific anti-transposable element defense and a diversity of transposons present in the genome. It is worth to mention that an evolutionary related AGO enzyme in prokaryotes was shown to protect its host against mobile genetic elements through DNA-guided DNA interference [65]. The setup of a reverse genetic system (i.e. HIGS and VIGS) based on delivery of dsRNA or sRNA for AMF genes would possibly help understanding some of the functional specificities associated to each of the AGO-like or RdRp present in the genome.In silico transcriptome analyses provided evidence of gene expression for the majority (DCL, 27 out of the 40 AGO-like and 19 out of 21 RdRp sequences) of the identified RNAi-related genes. Moreover, targeted gene expression profiles showed that some AGO-like and RdRp genes are differentially expressed between the extraradical and the intraradical mycelium two functionally distinct compartments of the symbiotic phase at the interface with the soil and with the plant, respectively, supporting the interesting possibility of a functional differentiation among distinct AGO-like and RdRp genes in the control of the symbiotic process.Small RNAseq data generated for the three biological conditions (ERM, RM and RC) were of good quality with relatively high genome-mapping percentages. As expected, enrichment of 21 and 24\u2009nt-long sequences was observed in plant reads of RM and RC samples [37, 49] which proofs the good quality of the sRNA and corresponding libraries preparations. Here the attention focused to the fungal sRNAome as no data are currently available for AMF. The length distribution of R. irregularis sRNAs (Rir-sRNAs) with two distinct peaks clearly differs from a flat curve over 20\u2009nt typically observed in organisms not provided with RNAi machinery [16] or fungal dcl knock-out mutants [66].The characterization of Rir-sRNA-generating loci suggests that R. irregularis possesses at least two different populations of sRNA-generating loci: the first one (cluster 1) mostly includes sequences overlapping with protein-coding genes, mainly not differentially expressed between ERM and RM, and that produce sRNAs of different sizes, while the second one (cluster 2) is enriched in 22\u201324\u2009nt-long sRNAs from intergenic sequences, mainly up-regulated in RM. Based on these results, we hypothesize that at least two distinct molecular pathways could contribute to the production of Rir-sRNAs. Indeed, two pathways are involved in sRNA generation in M. circinelloides: a Dicer-dependent and a Dicer-independent but RdRp-dependent one. Moreover, in analogy to what we observed, protein-encoding genes are the major source for sRNAs production in M. circinelloides [13, 44, 67]. Since in both R. irregularis and M. circinelloides the protein-encoding genes are the major source for sRNA, we could speculate that the Rir-sRNA originated from protein-coding sequences are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of the gene from which they originate, as it has been demonstrated in M. circinelloides [68, 69]. We did not perform a Rir-sRNA target prediction on fungal endogenous genes since no software for sRNAs target prediction in fungi is available and the predictions made with software developed for other organisms have rarely been experimentally validated [13].Among the population of Rir-sRNA-generating loci, 10 were predicted as miRNA-like. So far, miRNA-like have been identified in several fungi belonging to Ascomycota and Basidiomycota phyla but not in the basal fungus M. circinelloides [13, 69, 70]. This is the first evidence of miRNA-like occurrence in the Mucoromycota group. Since no miRNA-like database is currently available for fungal sequences, analysis for homolog sequences could not be done in an automated way. Remarkably, based on the current literature, unlike other eukaryotes, miRNA-like sequences are not conserved among fungi belonging to different genera [70]. Interestingly, three miRNA-like are up-regulated in the intraradical phase, which could lead to the hypothesis of miRNA-like AMF genes required to manipulate fungal or host plant gene expression; however, further analyses are necessary to confirm their possible functional role.In the absence of a tool specifically designed for the cross-kingdom RNA silencing towards plant transcripts, we have used sPARTA as one of the most powerful tool for target prediction and PARE validation in plants. Our in silico analysis, supported by degradome data, predicted 237 plant genes as putative targets of specific fungal sRNAs. Functional categories associated to these genes shows an enrichment in the GO terms related to hydrolases and endomembrane systems. Some specific target genes are here discussed in detail for their possible role in the AM symbiosis. The predicted target gene encoding the Specific Tissue (ST) protein 6 (transcript ID: AES73699) belongs to the family of ST proteins, whose function is unknown, but for which transcriptomic data suggest an involvement in biotic and abiotic stress [71, 72]. This protein family has been described in Fabaceae and Asteraceae but seems to be absent in others plant groups such as Brassicaceae [72]. Transcriptomic data suggest their involvement in biotic and abiotic stress [71, 72]. Interestingly, the expression of M. truncatula ST6 (MtST6) gene was found to be modulated during the different steps of the AM association [73, 74] and is induced by fungal diffusible signals, during hyphopodium formation [75] and in arbusculated cells [74]. In this regard, we speculate that one identified Rir-sRNA (3121\u201359) might have a regulatory role on MtST6 gene expression during the intraradical phase.Another predicted target is the Responsive To Dehydration 22 (RD22; transcript ID: AES74153) gene, an ABA-dependent signaling gene involved in abiotic stress tolerance [76\u201378] and in pathogen susceptibility ([79] and references therein). ABA positively regulates AM symbiosis; however, contradictory results have been obtained on ABA content in mycorrhizal roots [80]. In tomato, a gene involved in ABA catabolism (CYP707A3) was specifically expressed in arbuscule-containing cells, while the gene SlNCED, involved in the ABA biosynthesis, was detected only in cortical cells from non mycorrhizal plants, suggesting that a balance between biosynthesis and catabolism of ABA is determinant for the differentiation of arbuscules [81]. In this context, the targeting of the RD22 gene by three Rir-sRNAs (773\u2013218, 10,035\u201321, 10,035\u201321) could be related to the down-regulation of this gene in arbusculated cells [74].Interestingly, among the putative target genes of Rir-siRNAs, identified in this study, one encodes a DREPP plasma membrane protein (MtDREPP) (transcript ID: KEH37321) which was found to be down-regulated in mycorrhizal roots compared to non-mycorrhizal roots [82]. Host roots undergo plasma membrane (PM) remodeling events during the AMF colonization process from initial contact to intracellular accommodation of fungal structures [83]. In particular, arbuscule accommodation requires both PM expansion and periarbuscular membrane (PAM) generation. These events, that lead to dynamic change of PM protein composition [82] and polarized secretion mediated by exocytotic fusion of membrane vesicles [2], might involve MtDREPP modulation.It is worth mentioning that, among the Mt-mRNAs putative targets, we identified the AM-induced MtVapyrin (transcript ID: KEH25576) gene (Ankyrin repeat RF-like protein), which is required for arbuscule development [84, 85] and PAM formation [86]. It is tempting to speculate that its predicted targeting Rir-sRNA (2559\u201370) could contribute to modulate MtVapyrin expression in different cell populations and/or during arbuscule formation.Non-specific phospholipase C4 (NPC4) (transcript ID: KEH18078) is another predicted Rir-sRNA target gene whose gene product is localized to the PM. It shows high homology with Arabidopsis NPC4, a phospholipid-cleaving enzyme responsible for lipid remodeling during phosphate-limiting conditions. In Arabidopsis, it has been demonstrated that this gene family could be involved in plant defense response against different pathogens playing a role not only in elicitor recognition processes, but also in downstream disease resistance signaling [87].Another interesting putative target gene involved in host defense response is a nuclear-binding leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) type disease resistance encoding gene (transcript ID: AES68798) which shows high similarity with rice OsRGA3, a Resistance (R) gene associated with rice blast resistance. Since the response of plants to AMF involves a transient and spatial activation of defense mechanisms [88] the Rir-sRNA (7710\u201327) could be responsible for repressing this gene to allow AMF colonization.Although supported by computational analyses, further work is needed to experimentally confirm these putative Rir-sRNA-Mtr-mRNA interactions: 5\u2032 RACE assays would be useful to further validate cleavage sites and co- expression of sRNA and its putative mRNA target in transient transformation assay would be helpful to verify the existence of a selective RNAi in vivo [89].The description of RNAi-related genes, showing an expansion of AGO-like and RdRp genes, and the characterization of the sRNA population indicate that R. irregularis is equipped with a functional sRNA-generating pathway. Our in silico analysis predicted 237 plant genes as putative targets of specific fungal sRNAs suggesting that a cross-kingdom post-transcriptional gene silencing may occur during AMF colonization.Since HIGS and VIGS tools have been shown to function on AMF, it is likely that interspecies RNA movement also occurs from host plant towards AMF: the dataset generated in this work can be exploited to further investigate plant to fungus RNA exchanges in the AM symbiosis.All the fungal material (R. irregularis DAOM 197198) was obtained from mycorrhizal association with Medicago truncatula (Jemalong A17) plants. Nine day old M. truncatula seedlings, germinated in sterile conditions, were inoculated, using the Millipore sandwich method [90], with extraradical fungal structures (ERM) obtained from 2 in vitro monoxenic cultures of Agrobacterium rhizogenes-transformed chicory roots in two-compartment Petri plates [91]. In parallel, control non-mycorrhizal plants were treated in the same way, but avoiding the addition of the fungal inoculum. All the plants were fertilized with Long Ashton nutrient solution containing 32\u2009\u03bcM KH2PO4 and grown in a climate-controlled room at 22\u2009\u00b0C with a photoperiod of 14-h light and 10-h dark. After 60\u2009days from the inoculum, plant and fungal materials were harvested. The ERM was manually collected with tweezers under a stereo microscope. Mycorrhizal roots, from which the ERM was removed, were then collected and considered as the intra-radical mycelium (IRM, for qRT-PCR experiment) or mycorrhizal roots (RM, for RNA-seq analysis). Non mycorrhizal roots (RC) were observed under stereomicroscope, to confirm the absence of fungal structures, prior to collection. The harvested material was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, lyophilized and stored at \u2212\u200980\u2009\u00b0C.We screened, by keywords searches, the recent release of R. irregularis genome [40] for the presence of the putative homologs of fungal DCL, RdRp and AGO genes on JGI MycCosm portal [41]. For the identification of AGO sequences, we searched for \u201cpiwi\u201d and we retrieved (and considered as AGO-like) all the genes with a Piwi domain (Pfam family: PF02171). Regarding RdRp we retrieved all the genes annotated with a KOG (EuKaryotic Orthologous Groups) ID: KOG0988 (\u201cRNA-directed RNA polymerase QDE-1 required for post-transcriptional gene silencing and RNA interference\u201d). For DCL we searched for \u201cdicer\u201d and we kept only the sequences with two RNAse III domains [42].To identify the RNAi-related homologs genes in R. clarus, we first aligned separately AGO-like, RdRp and DCL R. irregularis proteins with MAFFT v7.310 (option: --auto) [92] and the alignments were used to build profiles HMM with hmmbuild with default parameters (HMMER 3.1b2 [93]). Then, using hmmsearch (HMMER 3.1b2) with default parameters, we searched for homologs in R. clarus proteome [47]. At that point, the resulting sequences were searched for protein domains with hmmscan (options: --cut_ga --domtblout; HMMER 3.1b2) against Pfam-A version 32.0 [94] HMM profiles and then we kept the sequences with a \u201cPiwi\u201d domain for AGO-like, a \u201cRdRP\u201d domain for RdRp and two \u201cRibonuclease_3\u201d domains for DCL.The whole amino acid sequences of DCL, AGO and RdRp genes were aligned with MAFFT v7.310 (option: --auto) [92]; the alignments were used for phylogenetic inference by the Maximum Likelihood method implemented in the IQ-TREE software (options: -m TEST -bb 1000 -alrt 1000) [95]. The software performed model selection [96], tree reconstruction and branch support analysis by ultra-fast bootstrap method [97] (1000 replicates). Trees were visualized with Evolview v2 [98]. Protein domains annotations (for tree visualization) were retrieved using hmmscan (options: --cut_ga --domtblout; HMMER 3.1b2) against Pfam-A version 32.0 [94].We retrieved the cDNA of each predicted DCL, AGO-like and RdRp proteins to perform an in silico gene expression analyses, exploiting RNA-seq datasets [40] available at the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRR3285893\u2013SRR3285895: 2\u2009day germinating spores; SRR3285917\u2013SRR3285919: symbiotic tissues). Paired reads were trimmed for adapters, filtered for qualities and aligned on cDNA with Bowtie2 (default parameters) [99]. For each sequence we calculated FPKM and we considered expressed all those with a value >\u20091 (arbitrary selected cut-off) in at least one of the two conditions (germinating spores and symbiotic tissues).Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) and then treated with TURBO\u2122 DNase (Ambion). The RNA samples were routinely checked for DNA contamination by PCR analysis, using primers for MtTef (RM samples) and for RiTef (ERM samples). For cDNA synthesis about 500\u2009ng of total RNA were denatured at 65\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009min and then reverse-transcribed at 25\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min, 42\u2009\u00b0C for 50\u2009min and 70\u2009\u00b0C for 15\u2009min in a final volume of 20\u2009\u03bcl containing 10\u2009\u03bcM random hexamers, 0.5\u2009mM dNTPs, 4\u2009\u03bcl 5X buffer, 2\u2009\u03bcl 0.1\u2009M DTT and 1\u2009\u03bcl Super-ScriptII (Invitrogen). qRT-PCR experiments were carried out in a final volume of 15\u2009\u03bcl containing 7.5\u2009\u03bcl of iTaq\u2122 Universal SYBR. Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), 5.5\u2009\u03bcl of 0.8\u2009M primer mix and 2\u2009\u03bcl of 1:10 diluted cDNA. Amplification were run in a Rotor-Gene Q apparatus (Qiagen) using the following program: 5\u2009min pre-incubation at 95\u2009\u00b0C and 40\u2009cycles of 30\u2009s at 95\u2009\u00b0C, 30\u2009s at 60\u201364\u2009\u00b0C. Each amplification was followed by melting curve analysis (60\u201394\u2009\u00b0C) with a heating rate of 0.5\u2009\u00b0C every 15\u2009s. All reactions were performed on at least four biological replicates each with two technical replicates. Relative expression and statistical analyses were performed by REST2009 [100], using as reference genes Ri-Tef and Ri-BetaTubulin1 (for R. irregularis RNAi-related gene expression). The presence of a functional AM symbiosis was evaluated (for small RNA-seq experiment) comparing the expression of the MtPT4 gene relative to the MtTEF housekeeping gene in RM (mycorrhizal roots) and RC (control non-mycorrhizal roots) samples. All primers were previously tested in conventional PCR assays on cDNA, followed by agarose gel electrophoresis, to confirm the specificity and amplification of a single fragment. The list of primers is given in Additional file 9.For sRNA sequencing, total RNA was extracted with Direct-zol\u2122 RNA MiniPrep (Zymo Research) kit. The concentration and quality of the nucleic acids were assessed with a Nanodrop1000 (Thermo Scientific). Samples were sent to Macrogen (South Korea) for RNA integrity check, library preparations and sequencing. A total of 9 libraries were sequenced: 3 for ERM samples, 3 for RM samples and 3 for RC samples. Each sample was a pool of equal RNA amounts from 3 different biological samples.Raw sRNA-seq reads, after being checked for quality with FastQC (Babraham Bioinformatics) [101], were cleaned for adapters (TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG), artifacts (default parameters) and low quality reads (\u2212q 28 -p 50) with Fastx Toolkit (Hannon Lab) [102]. We then removed all the reads mapping on tRNA, rRNA, snRNA and snoRNA on Rfam 12.0 database [103] (Rfam families IDs in Additional file 3) using bowtie aligner [104] allowing up to 1 mismatch. We further filtered reads removing those mapping with 0 mismatch on \u201cribosomal RNA\u201d sequences of the genus \u201cRhizophagus\u201d in GenBankand retained only the reads with a length between 18 and 35\u2009nt. Nucleotide length distribution, 5\u2032 terminal nucleotide composition and reads redundancy analyses were performed with a set of Perl and R scripts. Reads were mapped on R. irregularis DAOM 197198 v2.0 genome on JGI Genome Portal [105] and on M. truncatula A17 v4.0 genome on Ensembl [106] with 0 mismatch using bowtie.Reads mapping on R. irregularis genome from ERM and RM libraries were analyzed together in a single run with ShortStack v.3.8.5 [51], for the genome-guided sRNA-generating loci prediction (options: --mismatches 0 --foldsize 1000 --dicermin 18 --dicermax 35 --pad 200 --mincov 10.0rpmm). The software produced a count table file (with number of reads from each library that defined each locus) that was used for DE analysis between ERM and RM with DESeq2 1.18.1 Bioconductor package [52]. We considered, as differentially expressed, the loci with adjusted p-value <\u20090.05 (Benjamini\u2013Hochberg procedure). ShortStack was also used to produce an annotation file with genomic coordinates of sRNA-generating loci that was used for comparison with R. irregularis DAOM 197198 v2.0 gene annotation file with BEDTools [107]. To annotate a Rir-sRNA-generating locus on a specific genomic strand it should originate 80% of reads from the same strand (default parameter in ShortStack). Homology analysis of Rir-sRNA-generating loci with fungal repetitive elements from RepBase 23.04 [53] was performed with tblastx [108] (E-value <= 0.005).For PCA we calculated the nucleotide size proportion of sRNAs for each sRNA-generating locus from 18 to 35\u2009nt (compared to the total of sRNA reads that defined that locus) starting from ShortStack output file and we associated these data with nucleotide length of each locus and total number of reads that defined it. PCA was performed in R with \u201cFactoMineR\u201d (v1.41) package and results visualized with \u201cfactoextra\u201d (v1.0.5) package. DBSCAN clustering was performed with fpc package (parameters: eps\u2009=\u20090.5, minPts\u2009=\u200930).MicroRNA-like loci were annotated by ShortStack and their secondary structure were predicted and visualized with StrucVis v.0.3 [109].To identify M. truncatula transcripts potentially targeted by Rir-sRNAs in a hypothetical cross-kingdom RNA silencing process, we used sPARTA v.1.20 [56], a software for target prediction and PARE validation previously used for plant datasets, as it is our experimental system for target sequences. We used the 11,396 most expressed Rir-sRNAs (merging all the reads from ERM and RM libraries that mapped with 0 mismatch on R. irregularis genome) to find targets in M. truncatula A17 v.4.0 cDNAs (options: -tarPred E -tarScore --tag2FASTA --map2DD \u2013validate). For PARE validation we used published PARE-seq data (SRA accessions: SRR088877, SRR088878) obtained in similar experimental conditions (M. truncatula-R. irregularis symbiotic association; mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal roots; [37]), after being cleaned for adapters and artifacts (default parameters) and filtered for quality (\u2212q20) with Fastx Toolkit [102]. The output of sPARTA was filtered to keep only the the Rir-sRNA-mRNA pairs for which: a) corrected p-values <\u20090.05 (calculated by the software as the confidence score of a sRNA-target interaction corrected for the noise around the cleavage site); b) sRNA length between 21\u2009nt and 24\u2009nt; c) at least 5 PARE reads at cleavage sites from mycorrhizal PARE library; d) no PARE reads at cleavage site from non-mycorrhizal PARE library.To identify M. truncatula transcripts targeted by endogenous sRNAs, we used sPARTA as described above, using as queries the M. truncatula miRNAs (Mtr-miRNA) from miRBase (Release 22) [58]. The output was filtered to keep only the the Mtr-miRNA-mRNA pairs for which the following two conditions were both met: a) corrected p-values <\u20090.05; b) at least 5 PARE reads at cleavage sites from mycorrhizal PARE library.GO enrichment analysis was performed on transcripts identified as potential targets of Rir-sRNAs with AgriGO [110] (p-value <\u20090.01; statistical test: Fisher\u2019s test with Yekutieli multi-test adjustment method).The analysis of secondary siRNAs production from Mtr-mRNAs potentially targeted by Rir-sRNAs was performed following the procedure applied by Sahid et al. (2018) [28]. Reads from RM and RC libraries were mapped on M. truncatula A17 v.4.0 genome using ShortStack v.3.8.5 (\u2212mismatches 0,\u2013nohp), defining the full length of each mRNA as a locus (option -locifile). The output count table file was used for DE analysis (RM vs RC) with DESeq2 v.1.18.1 as described above. The resulting Mtr-mRNAs with an increased number of mapped reads in RM compared to RC were also checked for their presence in the list of potential targets for Rir-sRNAs and those in common were analyzed for pahsiRNA production with PhaseTank v1.0 [60] (default parameters).Arbuscular Mycorrhizal FungiExtra radical myceliumGene OntologyNon-mycorrhizal rootsMycorrhizal rootsSmall RNAResearch work was supported by the Italian Ministry for University and Research (MIUR - UNITO Ricerca Locale 2016) to L.L.

A first analysis, performed on DCL proteins, revealed that the only DCL of R. irregularis (1528548) is closely related to the two DCL described in M. circinelloides [44], consistent with the evolutionary relationships of the two taxonomic groups [1] (Fig.\u00a01) and confirming the analysis carried out by Lee et al. (2018) on a previous, more fragmented, version of R. irregularis genome assembly [30]. Interestingly, Lee et al. (2018) also identified two additional prokaryotic (class I) ribonuclease III protein coding genes, which seem to derive from horizontal gene transfer from cyanobacteria [30].\n\nFig. 1\nSummary of characterization of R. irregularis DCL including results of in silico gene expression, qRT-PCR, protein domains and phylogenetic analyses.

A phylogenetic analysis of the identified AGO-like sequences revealed that the R. irregularis genome encodes for 5 proteins (1580797, 1704186, 1662120, 1662010, 1697341) related to AGO of fungi belonging to Ascomycota (M. oryzae, N. crassa, C. parasitica and S. pombe), while 25 proteins (61334, 1606291, 1456683, 1478504, 1478501, 1582012, 1450356, 1741331, 1067111, 1577331, 1745457, 1764424, 1462304, 1556957, 1516785, 1600861, 1851280, 1829955, 1779081, 1748319, 1755567, 1868966, 1623940, 1782262 and 1884824) form a group with the three AGO proteins from M. circinelloides, a fungus which belongs to the Mucoromycota phylum that also includes AMF [1], and for which the RNAi machinery has been well characterized [13, 44].\n\nFig. 2\nSummary of characterization of Rhizophagus irregularis AGO-like proteins including results of in silico gene expression, qRT-PCR, protein domains and phylogenetic analyses.

Tree was rooted using Arabidopsis thaliana Argonaute 6 (NCBI Reference Sequence: NP_180853.2). Figure was generated with Evolview v2\nIn addition, our bioinformatics search allowed the identification of 21 putative RdRp proteins. The phylogenetic analysis shows that well characterized RdRp from Ascomycetes are grouped in three clades (Fig.\u00a03). Fifteen R. irregularis proteins cluster within the clade containing RdRp1 from Magnaporthe oryzae and are more related to the two proteins from M. circinelloides (144762, 135684). This suggests that these 15\u2009sequences may be a product of a recent gene expansion event. Three R. irregularis sequences (1778075, 1581910, 1697445) are grouped together with the clade containing RdRp2 from M. oryzae, close to the M. circinelloides 82,874 sequence. The association of the last three RdRp proteins (1473733, 1669713, 1646639) to the clade containing M. oryzae RdRp3 is not statistically well supported (Fig.\u00a03). When we added plant RdRp from the model organism A. thaliana in the analysis, no difference in the structure of the tree topology was detected (Additional file 1: Figure S2).\n\nFig. 3\nSummary of characterization of Rhizophagus irregularis RdRp including results of in silico gene expression, qRT-PCR, protein domains and phylogenetic analyses.

Figure was generated with Evolview v2\nTo find evidence of gene expression of the putative RNAi machinery, publicly available RNA-seq data [40] obtained from R. irregularis germinating spores and symbiotic tissues (mycorrhizal roots) were analyzed. Interestingly, the DCL gene (Fig.\u00a01), 27 out of the 40 AGO-like genes (Fig.\u00a02) and 19 out of 21 RdRp genes (Fig.\u00a03) are all expressed in at least one of two considered conditions (Additional file 2). To support the in silico expression analyses, we performed quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays on 13 genes (the single DCL, 10 AGO-like and 2 RdRp), randomly chosen from the group of expressed sequences. We focused on the symbiotic phase of the M. truncatula-R. irregularis association, considering the extraradical mycelium (ERM) and the intraradical mycelium (IRM), obtained by removing under a stereomicroscope the ERM from mycorrhizal roots. Seven AGO-like and 1 RdRp mRNAs (1662120, 1697341, 1582012, 1741331, 1623940, 1641401, 1668119 and 1778075) were up-regulated in ERM compared to IRM, while 3 AGO-like, 1 RdRp and the DCL (1868966, 1764424, 1641155, 1578121 and 1528548) showed no differential expression in the two conditions tested (Fig.\u00a04).\n\nFig. 4\nWhisker-box plot of the relative expression (ERM\u2009=\u2009\u201cextraradical mycelium\u201d vs IRM\u2009=\u2009\u201cintraradical mycelium\u201d) calculated by REST2009 software of 10 AGO-like, 2 RdRp and the DCL genes identified in Rhizophagus irregularis, here reported with their JGI protein ID.

Reads were then mapped on M. truncatula and R. irregularis genomes allowing zero mismatches. Considering the different biological replicates, the 76\u201382% of reads from ERM libraries mapped on the fungal genome and less than 1% on the plant genome, probably because of a contamination by root material during ERM harvesting (Fig.\u00a05a), even though we can not exclude a possible plant-originated sRNA component present natively in ERM as recently observed in the Botrytis cinerea-host plant interaction [27]. The 76\u201385% of reads from RC libraries mapped on plant genome with a very limited number of reads mapping on fungal genome (0.01\u20130.02%). For RM samples an intermediate situation was observed with 62\u201370% reads mapping on plant genome and 10\u201320% on fungal genome. A very low percentage of reads for each condition mapped on both plant and fungal genomes: about 0.1% for ERM, 0.01% for RC and 0.02\u20130.05% for RM libraries (Fig.\u00a05a).\n\nFig. 5\na) Relative mapping frequencies for each library (Rhi\u2009=\u2009reads mapping on Rhizophagus irregularis genome, Med\u2009=\u2009reads mapping on Medicago truncatula genome, Rhi\u2009+\u2009Med\u2009=\u2009reads mapping on both genomes). b) Length distribution (expressed in number of nucleotides) of sRNA reads (redundant and non-redundant) from ERM (extraradical mycelium) and RM (mycorrhizal roots) libraries mapping on R. irregularis genome\nIn order to evaluate the possible existence of different populations of Rir-sRNA-generating loci, we performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). For this purpose, as proposed by Fahlgren et al. (2013) [54], we used a model considering the following independent variables: the length of loci, the total number of mapped reads and the nucleotide size proportion of Rir-sRNAs (from 18\u2009nt to 35\u2009nt) defining each locus (19 variables in total). The first principal component (PC1), that explained the 25.8% of the total variance, mainly based on the proportion of 21\u201325 and 27\u201335\u2009nt-long reads, differentiated the Rir-sRNA-generating loci in 2 groups (Fig.\u00a06a). The use of DBSCAN (density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) algorithm [55] confirmed indeed the presence of two different groups of data: cluster 1 and cluster 2 composed of 1100 and 819 loci, respectively (Fig.\u00a06b). The average nucleotide size distribution of the reads for loci belonging to cluster 1 revealed a decreasing curve from 18 to 35\u2009nt with no evident peaks while for cluster 2 we recorded an enrichment in 22\u201324\u2009nt-long sequences (Fig.\u00a07).\n\nFig. 6\nCharacterization of Rir-sRNA generating loci. a) Biplot of principal component 1 and 2 of PCA based on the length of loci, the total number of mapped reads and the nucleotide size proportion of Rir-sRNAs (from 18\u2009nt to 35\u2009nt) defining each locus (19 total variables); b) DBSCAN clustering reveals the presence of two distinct populations of data (Cluster 1 and 2); c) Overview of the positions of the loci compared to those of protein-encoding genes; d) Differential expression analysis of loci between ERM (extra radical mycelium) and RM (mycorrhizal root) conditions (ERM\u2009=\u2009up-regulated in ERM; No\u2009=\u2009not differentially regulated; RM\u2009=\u2009up-regulated in RM)\n\n\nFig. 7\nLength distribution (in number of nucleotides) of small RNA reads that defined the Rir-sRNA-generating loci of Cluster 1 (a) and 2\u00a0(b) according to DBSCAN clustering.

These sequences, if transcribed, have the ability to form hairpin structures and the software predicts the accumulation of miRNA-miRNA* pairs (Fig.\u00a08). The length of these loci varies from 102\u2009nt (locus 338) to 610\u2009nt (locus 828) while their expression (considering the sum of all RM and ERM libraries) ranges from 196 reads (locus 1596) to 74,526 reads (locus 340; the fourth most expressed sRNA-generating locus). Interestingly, 7 loci are located on the negative strand of the same genome scaffold (scaffold 28) in sequential order within a 8.3 kbp region. The length distribution of reads produced by the Rir-miRNA-like loci, as well as the length of mature miRNA sequences, are enriched in sequences from 19\u2009nt to 24\u2009nt (data not shown). Three Rir-miRNA-like loci (341, 342, 828) show an increased sRNA production in RM condition.Table 1\nCharacteristics of predicted miRNA-like loci\n\n\nFig. 8\nPredicted secondary structures of putative Rhizophagus irregularis miRNA-like with color-coded sRNA-seq coverage per nucleotide\n\n\nAdditional file 1:\nFigure S1.

Recent years have seen tremendous growth in our understanding of the role microglia play in neurodegeneration, CNS injury, and developmental disorders. Given that microglia show diverse functional phenotypes, there is a need for more precise tools to characterize microglial states. Here, we experimentally define gene modules as the foundation for describing microglial functional states.In an effort to develop a comprehensive classification scheme, we profiled transcriptomes of mouse microglia in a stimulus panel with 96 different conditions. Using the transcriptomic data, we generated fine-resolution gene modules that are robustly preserved across datasets. These modules served as the basis for a combinatorial code that we then used to characterize microglial activation under various inflammatory stimulus conditions.The microglial gene modules described here were robustly preserved, and could be applied to in vivo as well as in vitro conditions to dissociate the signaling pathways that distinguish acutely inflamed microglia from aged microglia. The microglial gene modules presented here are a novel resource for classifying and characterizing microglial states in health and disease.1Microglia have relatively recently emerged as important regulators of brain homeostasis, with roles in neuronal survival and proliferation, synaptic pruning, and immune response [1\u20134]. Microglia actively survey the environment in their basal state, and upon encountering a stimulus change their gene expression and secretory profiles [5].An increasing appreciation of microglia in health and disease has led to a significant therapeutic interest in microglia and neuroinflammation. Given microglia\u2019s malleable phenotype, characterizing microglia activation states in disease has become a key issue [6]. Our ability to detect and classify microglia activation states is rapidly evolving. Initially, microglia were classified as \u2018activated\u2019 or not, mainly based on morphology. The idea of anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory states was introduced to the field of microglia in 2006 by Butovsky et al., and the M1/M2 classification originating from macrophages was adopted by subsequent publications [7, 8]. More recently, studies have uncovered states that do not align with the conventional M1/M2 paradigm, implying that a binary classification is insufficient and that there are additional microglia states [9\u201311]. Therefore, there is a clear need for an improved classification scheme that can adequately define and help describe the molecular basis for microglial phenotypes.Analysis of co-expression patterns from genome-wide transcriptional profiling datasets provides a powerful means to dissect the molecular basis of cellular behavior and state [12]. For example, a recent study of alveolar macrophages used 28 different treatments to generate 49 gene modules [13]. The modules were then applied to macrophage transcriptomes of healthy and Chronic Obtsructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients, and the authors identified a loss of inflammatory module signatures in the COPD patients that was distinct from the canonical M1 signature. Having a similarly comprehensive resource for microglia would allow us to obtain cell-type-specific modules that form the basis of understanding microglial activation in disease.In this study, we induced a broad spectrum of activation states in mouse microglia by using a stimulus panel of 96 different treatments. Gene expression changes were organized into 33 modules by Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) [14]. The modules were highly reproducible and had the resolution to distinguish between closely related signaling pathways. We developed a combinatorial code based on the modules, and used it to distinguish between microglia in numerous activation states. Additionally, we identified transcription factors whose known binding sites were enriched within gene modules. In vivo, we used modules to characterize aging, the dominant risk factor for many neurodegenerative diseases. The results of this study will serve as a new resource for classifying microglial activation, and provides a foundation for manipulating microglial phenotypes in disease.Microglia can take on a variety of states, characterized by altered gene expression, morphology, and function. In order to induce a diverse array of microglial states, we constructed a stimulus panel comprising 96 different conditions. The panel consisted of 37 unique stimuli including cytokines, pharmacological inhibitors, and molecules known to act in the brain milieu such as ATP and dopamine. Stimuli were applied to microglial samples individually and in combination at 4, 24 and 72\u2009h. A full list of stimulus conditions\u00a0and number of replicates is available in Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S1\u00a0and Additional file 2:\u00a0Table S2, respectively.We assessed the reproducibility of each module by measuring the intra-module correlation score, which reflects the degree of correlation between the genes that comprise the module (Fig. 2b, Methods). The defining feature of a module is the correlated expression of its constituent genes; as such, only the 33 modules showing high intra-module correlation over 100 bootstrapped datasets were used for downstream analyses. A full list of modules and their member genes can be found in Additional\u00a0file\u00a03: Table S3.The activity of a module can be represented by the module eigengene. The eigengene is computed as the first principal component of the genes that make up the module [14], and depicts the dominant trend of expression that is common to those genes. By comparing the module eigengene values across stimulus conditions, one can determine the relative expression of the genes in that module between different conditions. A module was considered active if the module eigengene was differentially expressed between control and test conditions (p\u2009<\u20090.05 with Bonferroni correction). Module activity reflects co-regulation of its constituent genes. A comparison of module eigengene activity across conditions showed that all 33 modules have a distinct pattern of regulation (Fig. 2c).The genes from each module were analyzed by Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis [15, 16]. Many modules were also associated with GO terms such as \u201cresponse to cytokine stimulus\u201d and \u201cimmune response\u201d, consistent with the known functions of microglia. Furthermore, more specific GO terms were linked to the expected module; for example, \u201ccellular response to interferon-gamma\u201d was exclusively linked to a module that was strongly responsive to interferon gamma (\u201cPI_turquoise\u201d, Fig. 2c). A module responsive to type I interferons (\u201cBR_turquoise\u201d, Fig. 2c) was associated with GO terms such as \u201cresponse to interferon-beta\u201d and \u201cresponse to virus\u201d, in line with the known anti-viral role of interferon signaling [17]. Not all modules were associated with a known GO term. This is likely because (1) our modules are microglia-specific whereas gene ontology is derived from many different cell and tissue types, and (2) the resolution of our modules goes beyond the biological pathways that can be found in gene ontology databases. Results for all modules are summarized in Additional\u00a0file\u00a04: Table S4.To characterize the transcriptional states in various inflammatory conditions, we compared the transcriptional response to six different stimuli: IFN type I (IFNa and IFNb), IFN type II (IFNg), TLR2 (polyIC), TLR3 (P3C), and TLR4 (LPS).The overlapping patterns of activity could be described by a combinatorial code. Comparing activation of just four modules, such as BR_turquoise, PI_turquoise, CY_turquoise, YE_turquoise, was sufficient to distinguish between the five types of stimuli (Fig. 3b). Note, the two IFN type I stimuli did not show significant difference in any module.To extend the applicability of these modules to future experiments, we identified hub genes to be used as markers for each module. In this context, hub genes are defined as the genes that show high correlation to the module eigengene and can thus serve as biological markers of module activity (see Methods for hub gene ranking and selection). Figure\u00a03c illustrates how the expression of the hub gene for each of the four modules, BR_turquoise, PI_turquoise, CY_turquoise, YE_turquoise, can be used as a combinatorial code to identify which of the pro-inflammatory stimuli microglia had been exposed to. Figure 3d tabulates the results of Fig. 3c to demonstrate how different signaling pathways are associated with a specific combination of hub genes.We challenged the robustness of our hub genes using samples from several test conditions. The hub genes were derived from conditions where the stimuli were applied for 24\u2009h. As our test case, we selected conditions where the same stimuli were applied for 72\u2009h, as well as an additional combinatorial stimulus condition (Fig. 3e). Figure 3f compares the actual results to the results that would be predicted based on the code established in Fig. 3d. Nearly all conditions met their prediction; as expected, type I interferons (IFNa and IFNb) could be identified by the induction of Ifit3 and absence of Naaa, while type II interferon (IFNg) induced both Ifit3 and Naaa. Furthermore, combinatorial stimuli that include P3C and IFNb induced signatures for both stimuli. There was a discrepancy in LPS, in that Naaa was induced when it was not predicted based on the original combinatorial code. This is likely due to the amplification of downstream signaling cascades in the 72\u2009h LPS stimulation condition; LPS is known to induce interferon-gamma production in macrophages, and the induction of Naaa is consistent with the presence of interferon gamma [18].We further probed the modular transcriptional activity by examining the effect of anti-inflammatory agents on gene expression. We treated microglia for 24\u2009h with LPS alone or in combination with resveratrol, a natural phenol, or rapamycin, a small-molecule inhibitor of the mTOR pathway.Studies comparing acutely isolated microglia to microglia in culture have shown that there are a number of transcriptional changes induced by the environment [20]. We wanted to see whether this would affect the modular nature of microglial gene expression, or if the same gene modules could be extended to an in vivo context. Mice were injected i.p. with LPS or vehicle, followed by isolation of microglia for transcriptional profiling at 4\u2009h post injection. Consistent with the literature, comparison of the vehicle-treated in vivo samples to the untreated controls in our in vitro samples showed that there was induction of genes such as Gpnmb, Spp1, and Msr1, and downregulation of genes such as Tmem119, Olfml3, and Sall1 (data not shown).We expect true biological modules to be preserved even at the single-cell level. To test whether our modules could translate to single-cell microglial transcriptomes, we used a recent published dataset; Mathys et al., (2018). sequenced individual microglia from CK-p25 mice, an Alzheimer\u2019s disease model with a rapidly progressing neurodegeneration phenotype, and identified subsets of microglia associated with the various stages of neurodegeneration [21]. They found distinct sets of genes upregulated in microglia at different stages of disease. We overlaid the gene sets from Mathys et al., with our modules to see whether their gene sets could be partitioned based on our modules. Figure\u00a06c shows that genes upregulated in microglia in early-stage disease fall within a single one of our modules. Mathys et al., identified two different subsets of late-stage microglia, and these were characterized by BR_turquoise and PI_turquoise modules, respectively (Fig. 6c). Thus, we find that our modules are preserved even at the single-cell level.Here we present a framework for understanding microglial states using gene expression modules. Using 96 stimulus conditions, we induced a wide variety of microglial transcriptional programs and categorized a complex transcriptional response into concise gene expression modules using a clustering-based approach. We demonstrate the utility of these modules in identifying numerous microglial activation states.Modular organization of gene expression has been shown in other organisms and cell types [23\u201325]. Previous studies have identified co-expression modules in microglia associated with aging, as well as different brain regions [11, 26]. While these works provide us with a useful way of understanding gene expression changes in specific contexts, the small number of conditions in these studies limits the level of the detail the modules can provide; typically, these modules can only be associated with the age or disease status included in the experiment. In contrast, we designed our stimulus panel with the intention of isolating modules that are capable of resolving individual signaling pathways implicated in a broad spectrum of microglia-related pathologies. We successfully identified 33 modules that distinguish between closely related stimuli.A small number of modules showed co-regulation in vitro but not in vivo, which may be attributed to the transcriptional changes that take place when microglia are removed from the CNS environment. A greater number of modules showed the same co-regulation in vivo as they did in vitro, indicating that despite transcriptional changes at baseline, the network connectivity between these genes is unaffected. The fact that a subset of these modules could be observed in an independent single-cell dataset supports the idea that these modules can be applied in vivo.Using gene modules provides several advantages in describing microglial state. The use of single marker genes such as Tnf and Arg1, while indicative of general activation, often cannot resolve different inflammatory states, such as IFN-activated versus LPS-activated microglia. We propose a combinatorial code of gene module activity to describe microglial states. As demonstrated, a combinatorial module code robustly differentiated between type I IFNs, IFNg, PolyIC, LPS and P3C in vitro, and acute LPS-induced inflammation and chronic aged-induced inflammation in vivo (Fig. 8).A descriptive system based on modules carries a significant practical benefit: hub genes can be used to report on the activity of their respective modules. Hub genes offer the same tractability as the current individual marker genes, but are representative of a defined set of co-regulated genes and associated biological pathways. Hub gene expression can thus be used, in lieu of complete transcriptome sequencing, to characterize microglia activation states. As an example, we show that six pro-inflammatory conditions in vitro can be distinguished using four hub gene markers (Fig. 3c). For in vivo work, this also opens up the possibility of using multiplexed in situ hybridization to characterize microglia activation states.In addition to addressing the issue of characterizing microglial activation states, our results give novel insight into inflammatory signaling pathways. Although it has long been known that IFN type I and type II signal through different receptors [27], the effect of each on microglial gene expression was not fully known. We find there is a group of genes commonly induced by both types of interferons, which include Stat1 and Cd86. We also find groups of genes that are preferentially induced by type I or type II interferon signaling. Genes such as Ifit1, C2, Lgals3bp and Irf7 were associated with type I signaling, whereas genes such as Cxcl9 and Socs1 were more strongly induced by type II signaling. Notably, the group of genes including Naaa, Zyx and Clec9a were highly specific to interferon type II response and was not induced by any other stimulus tested.These gene modules also provide a strong basis to uncover regulators that drive microglial states. The transcription factors associated with each module present a potential biological mechanism by which the modular regulation may be achieved. Interestingly, several of these, such as Irf8 and Nfkb1, have been previously identified as Signal Dependent Transcription Factors that may regulate microglial phenotype in neuropathic pain and neurodegeneration, respectively [28, 29]. It will be interesting to see whether the microglia in these disease scenarios correspond to upregulation of the modules found in our study. Additionally, the transcription factors identified here could be tested for use as therapeutic targets to downregulate modules of interest. For modules that did not show strong association with any particular transcription factor, microRNAs or other factors may be acting to further regulate subsets of genes. Future studies should examine potential regulatory regions shared by genes in a given module.Chronic activation phenotypes are of particular relevance to the pathological role of microglia. Indeed, this is a central consideration when interpreting the role of microglia in various neurological conditions that become more prevalent with age, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis [30\u201333]. Here, we profiled microglia from aged wild-type mice to study the microglial priming phenotype. The gene expression pattern in aged mice corresponded to the up-regulation of three gene modules, BR_turquoise, CY_turquoise and CY_yellow. Our stimulus panel shows that the BR_turquoise module was activated by IFN type I stimuli (Fig. 3), in line with results from previous studies that have shown upregulation of IFN type I signaling with aging [34]. The other two modules, CY_turquoise and CY_yellow, were activated by the TLR3 stimulus in our panel (Fig. 3). Furthermore, pathway analysis results comparing the BR_turquoise module and the CY_turquose + CY_yellow module show that former is responsible for activating the viral response, IFN-alpha and IFN-beta pathways, whereas the latter is associated with innate immune response and migration (Fig. 7c). In effect, we have successfully dissected the microglial aging signature further into two separate components; one, a known interferon type I signal, and the other, a previously uncharacterized gene signature induced by TLR3 signaling. This analysis provides testable hypotheses for reversing age-induced molecular changes in microglia.Comparison of aging and acute inflammation in vivo revealed that distinct sets of modules dominate the microglial response in these two perturbations (Fig. 7a, left). Pathway analysis showed upregulation of proliferation and migration during acute inflammation, which was not seen in aged microglia, pointing to different functional properties in acutely vs chronically inflammatory microglia. This is an important point from a therapeutic viewpoint \u2013 anti-inflammatory drugs targeting canonical inflammatory cascades may not counteract the chronic inflammation seen in aged microglia.We were able to recapitulate portions of the aging-associated module activation pattern in several of our in vitro conditions. Comparison of 4- and 72-h LPS stimulation showed a similar distinction to that of acute LPS-treatment and aging in vivo, respectively (Fig. 7a, right). In the case of 72-h LPS stimulation in vitro, we found induction of one additional module, CY_brown, that was not prominent in aging in vivo. This module may be unique to LPS, or may reflect the limitations of recapitulating the aged phenotype in vitro. Despite this difference, our results indicate that aged microglia may be modeled in part by chronic LPS stimulation in vitro, providing a useful way to model certain aspects of microglial priming in a short time span. Additionally, we observed that chronic stimulation with IFNb or P3C induced non-overlapping subsets of the aging-associated modules, suggesting that interferon type I and TLR1/2 signaling could both contribute to the aging phenotype. Future experiments should address which of these modules can be associated with microglial dysfunction.Microglia stimulated by LPS are known to release a plethora of cytokines that in turn activate other receptors besides TLR4 [35\u201337]. As such, gene expression changes in our 72-h stimulus conditions may represent a response to endogenous signals released by microglia, rather than a response to the exogenous stimulus itself. This raises the possibility that the aged phenotype of microglia in vivo is similarly a response to autonomous signaling in response to chronic activation.This work provides a comprehensive dataset that can be used as the basis for classifying microglial phenotypes. First and foremost, we find that microglial gene expression is modular in nature, and the gene modules derived here can be used to characterize microglial states both in vitro and in vivo. The combinatorial code of module activity can distinguish between states induced by a variety of stimulus types and treatment durations; distinct transcriptional activation states were induced by IFN type I, IFN type II, TLR2, TLR3 and TLR4 signaling. The in vitro stimulus panel itself supplements traditional pathway and regulator analysis, as it is a microglia-specific resource with experimentally validated annotations that link gene co-expression to stimulus. Utilizing this feature, we show that aging microglia are in an activation state that is dominated by IFN type I and TLR3 signals, providing new insight for targeting senescence of the neuro-immune system. In summary, our data provide a novel resource for elucidating microglial states.Primary neonatal mouse microglia (Sciencell, Cat#M1900\u201357) were cultured in poly-lysine coated 96-well plates with Microglia Medium (Sciencell, Cat #1901). Cultures were kept in an incubator at 37\u2009\u00b0C, 5% CO2. Media was refreshed 24\u2009h after plating. 4\u2009days after plating, media was removed and replaced with fresh media containing a stimulus.Animal studies were conducted under a protocol approved by the Ionis Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AALAC) approved animal facility. For the LPS-stimulation experiment, female C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratories), 2\u2009month old, were injected intraperitoneally with 2\u2009mg/kg LPS (Sigma, strain 0111:B4) formulated at 0.5\u2009mg/ml in PBS (n\u2009=\u20094). At 4\u2009h post dosing, microglia were isolated as described below. For comparison of aged and young mice, we isolated microglia from male C57BL/6 mice at 22-month and 2-months of age respectively (n\u2009=\u200912).Mice were deeply anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation (4% in air carrier gas) in an induction box and maintained on a deep plane of anesthesia using a nose cone. The anesthetized animals were perfused with ice-cold PBS and whole brains were collected in 1X HBSS+HEPES buffer. Brains were finely minced with a razorblade and digested in Accutase (EMD Millipore, Cat #SCR005) at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 45\u2009min. Following successive trituration with clipped pipette tips of decreasing diameter, cells were washed with 1X HBSS+HEPES and filtered with a 250 uM mesh filter. Tissue homogenates were centrifuged over a 30% Percoll gradient to remove myelin. Microglia were isolated by Magnet Activated Cell Sorting (MACS) using a CD11b antibody (Miltenyi).While Cd11b is expressed on peripheral monocytes in addition to microglia, our method of perfusion removes blood contamination from the CNS and thus minimizes peripheral monocyte contamination of our sample from peripheral monocytes. We confirmed the purity of this method using flow cytometry. Previous studies have shown that flow cytometry analysis of CD45 levels distinguishes between CD11b-positive microglia and macrophages, with microglia expressing CD45 at low levels and macrophages expressing it at high levels [38]. Our flow cytometry analysis shows that 97.3% of the cells in our CD11b-isolated microglial samples are CD45-low, and only 1.4% are CD45-high (Additional\u00a0file\u00a05: Figure S1).Furthermore, we examined cell-type specific marker expression of the microglial samples used in our analyses. Our samples show high expression of the microglia-specific markers, while having little to no expression for markers of other immune cell types (Additional file 6: Figure S2). The markers for each cell-type were derived by single-cell analyses from brain immune cell populations [39], which have none of the confounding effects of contaminated populations, as well as other seminal papers that have focused on differentiating microglia from other CNS immune cell types [40, 41].RNA extraction was performed using Qiagen RNeasy kits. 0.5\u20131\u2009ng of total RNA was used as template for the initial reverse transcription, which included 0.27 uM of barcoded primer, containing a T7 promoter sequence. 48\u201396 cDNA samples were pooled, followed by a 8\u2009h\u2009T7 amplification. 50\u2009ng of the resulting aRNA was used as input for library generation using the Quantseq aRNA kit (Lexogen, Cat #043.24.V0.1).NGS libraries were sequenced as 75\u2009bp fragments with a median depth of 6.1 million reads per sample on an Illumina NextSeq500. Transcript quantitation was performed with Salmon (ver 0.7.1) using quasi-mapping based mode with automated libtype detection [42]. Gene level TPM was computed by summing read counts of all associated transcript isoforms and normalizing by total number of mapped reads. Gene model indexes were generated from Ensembl Mus musculus build 81 [43]. The median alignment rate through salmon was 81.5%. Samples with less than 1 million mapped reads or less than 6500 genes expressed (TPM\u2009>\u20095) were discarded. Differential gene expression was assessed by comparing against a negative binomial error model based on gene expression in control microglia samples. Gene-specific p-values were computed for each biological replicate and median-aggregated. Genes having a minimum p-value less than or equal to 0.05 in all replicates within a group were considered significant and used in downstream analysis.A group of 6215 genes were selected based on top 4000 genes that were highly variable across all conditions and an additional 2215 genes that were differentially expressed in at least one condition. Of the 96 conditions tested, we selected 40 core conditions as input to the WGCNA analysis. Many of the 96 conditions consisted of LPS combined with a potential modulator (ie., rapamycin), and we excluded these from the input. As the WGCNA method relies on variability between samples, the inclusion of all LPS\u2009+\u2009modulator conditions would drive WGCNA to primarily detect the LPS response and lose sensitivity to more subtle responses from other stimulus conditions. Hence, our input conditions were designed to prevent biasing WGCNA results towards the LPS response. Each condition had a minimum of four replications from two different experimental days, for a total of 373 samples. It is well known that gene expression is distributed as a Negative Binomial distribution -genes with a higher expression level typically exhibit higher variability in expression than expected from Poisson behavior [44]. Clustering algorithms assume Gaussian noise around cluster centers and underlying distance measures reflect this assumption. In order to mitigate the dependence of variance on mean expression we transformed the expression level by using the function for Negative Binomial distribution, such that the transformed variable is Gaussian distributed -a process known as variance stabilization [45]. The function for Negative Binomial distribution, and this stabilized expression matrix was used as input for WGCNA (ver 1.51).For the first round of clustering, the adjacency matrix was calculated with a soft power of 4. The soft power was selected based on the standard connectivity analysis for WGCNA; briefly, we chose the lowest soft power value where the scale-free topology threshold is met [14]. The cutreeDynamic function was run with the following parameters: deepSplit\u2009=\u20091, PAMstage\u2009=\u2009True, minClusterSize\u2009=\u200920, method\u2009=\u2009hybrid. The mergeCloseModules function and was run with a cut height of 0.25. The resulting 14 modules were clustered in a second round, using matrices consisting of the genes in a given first order module and the samples associated with the module. The cutreeDynamic parameters for the second-round clustering were as follows: deepSplit\u2009=\u20094, PAMstage\u2009=\u2009False, minClusterSize\u2009=\u200920, method\u2009=\u2009hybrid. Three of the first order modules remained as a single module after the second round of clustering, indicating that additional modules were not forced in cases where the 1st order cluster was already optimal.Module reproducibility was determined by the intra-module correlation score. We derived the score by first ranking all genes in a given module according to their mean Pearson correlation coefficient against other genes in the module. The correlation coefficient of the gene at the 75th percentile was then selected as the intra-module correlation score. We repeated the measure on 100 independent subsets of the data, which were obtained by randomly selecting half of the samples in each condition. The resulting scores were used to compute mean and variance. Modules with a mean score greater than 0.35 were considered reproducible.The in vivo status of modules was assessed by quantifying activation and reproducibility. Activation was defined as a 1.5-fold change in gene expression compared to control. Modules in which less than a third of the genes did not meet the activation threshold were categorized as inactive, and these modules excluded from further analysis. Reproducibility was defined as an intra-module correlation score greater than 0.35 based on the active genes in a given module.Genes in each module were first ranked by correlation to the module eigengene\u2014the module eigenegene is defined as the first principle component in the gene space of a given module [14]. Of the ten genes with the highest correlation, the gene with the lowest coefficient of variance and minimum expression of at least 5 TPM was selected as the hub gene for the module.We used the web-based application gProfiler [46] to obtain significantly enriched GO biological process and Reactome pathways, excluding electronic GO annotations. The resulting pathways were then displayed using the Enrichment Map app in Cytoscape 3.0 using Jaccard similarity coefficient with an FDR cutoff of 0.0001 [47, 48].For transcription factor prediction, we used the cytoscape plugin GeneMANIA to first create networks between the genes in each module [49]. The network was analyzed using the cytoscape plugin iRegulon (\u2018Predict regulators and targets\u2019 function, motif collection\u2009=\u200910\u2009K (9213 PWMs)) to rank motifs around the 20\u2009kb centered around the transcriptional start site. TFs were predicted with maximum FDR of 0.001 in motif similarity.Mann-Whitney U tests were performed using the Python scipy package. p\u2009<\u20090.05 after Bonferroni correction was considered significant.Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal CareCentral Nervous SystemChronic Obstructive Pulmonary DiseaseFalse Discovery RateGene OntologyInstitutional Animal Care and Use CommitteeInterferonLinoleic AcidLipopolysaccharideMagnet Activated Cell SortingNormalized Enrichment ScorePam3CysSerLys4Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acidPosition Weight MatrixToll-like ReceptorWeighted Gene Correlation Network AnalysisThis work is supported by internal funding from Ionis Pharmaceuticals.

Of these, 784 samples passed quality control metrics (see Methods). Samples showed high within-condition correlation, confirming the reproducibility between samples (mean Pearson R\u2009=\u20090.937, min\u2009=\u20090.85, max\u2009=\u20090.994). Additionally, we found reduced correlation between many of the known inflammatory stimuli, indicating there was a variety of activation states in our samples (Fig.\u00a01a). Canonical stimuli such as LPS and IL4 showed upregulation of the expected markers (Fig. 1b). There were also a number of stimuli that did not induce a response, such as CCL7, nicotine, and LiA. This result was not surprising, given that our panel included stimuli that have not been shown to affect microglia directly. A full dose titration of each stimulus would be necessary to conclude that microglia are unresponsive to a given stimulus.\n\nFig. 1\nStimulus panel induces a variety of transcriptomic states in microglia. a Hierarchically clustered heatmap of Pearson correlation coefficients between stimulus conditions, based on 6215 most variable genes. b Differential expression of canonical markers of LPS (Tnf, Il1b) and IL4 stimulation (Arg1, Retnla).

WGCNA is a robust hierarchical clustering method that employs weighted correlation matrices and adaptive branch cutting to delineate modules of genes that co-vary across samples [14]. The initial clustering step distinguished between the stimulus conditions with the greatest differences, such as IFN and TLR stimuli. We then performed a second clustering step using only the conditions associated with each module (Fig.\u00a02a). This second step allowed us to resolve nuanced gene expression patterns, such as those that distinguish between interferon (IFN) type I and type II stimuli. The two-step clustering method yielded a total of 37 modules, ranging in size from 20 to 148 genes.\n\nFig. 2\nCorrelation network analysis reveals microglial gene modules. a WGCNA clustering scheme.\u00a01st order clustering was performed on 6215 genes across all core conditions [left]. Each resulting 1st order cluster was then run on WGCNA a second time (2nd order clustering). Example shows 2nd order clustering using the 1st order BR module [center],which yields two 2nd order modules \u2013 BR_blue and BR_turquoise.

In contrast, our modules captured responses from all six stimuli, with a given stimulus regulating anywhere from 7 to 19 modules (IFN type I and LPS, respectively) (Fig. 3b). Several modules showed a distinction between IFN I vs II stimuli (BR_turquoise, PI_blue, PI_turquoise), while other modules (CY_yellow, CY_blue, CY_brown, YE_turquoise and TQ_brown) were only regulated by TLR 1/2 and 4 stimuli. Most modules showed regulation in two or more conditions, but notably, no module was upregulated by all six stimuli.\n\nFig. 3\nModule markers can be used in a combinatorial code to distinguish between inflammatory states. a Differential expression of canonical M1 (Tnf, Il1b) markers upon stimulation with inflammatory stimuli.

Combining rapamycin with LPS did not reduce activity in any of the nine LPS-responsive modules. In contrast, combining resveratrol with LPS reduced gene expression by over 50% in several modules. Notably, this reduction in activity by resveratrol was restricted to some modules, as several other modules still showed the same level of activity as when treated with LPS alone (Fig.\u00a04a). Median decrease in gene expression in the four LPS-responsive modules with greatest effects of resveratrol (BR_blue, BR_turquoise, PI_blue, CY_yellow) was 1.74-fold (Fig. 4b, left). In comparison, there was no change in the LPS-response in other modules such as CY_blue, CY_turquoise, CY_brown (Fig. 4b, right). These results demonstrate that the modules can be independently regulated, and likely represent genes in distinct biological pathways.\n\nFig. 4\nA subset of LPS-induced modules are regulated by resveratrol. a Heatmap of median differential expression of module genes, normalized to LPS response. Only modules activated by LPS are shown. b Line plots comparing differential expression of genes in modules strongly regulated by resveratrol [left], or unaffected by resveratrol [right]. Each black line represents a single gene. Thick lines represent mean differential expression for each module [red line: BR_blue module, orange line: CY_yellow module, magenta line: PI_blue module, purple line: BR_turquoise, green line: CY_blue module, turquoise line: CY_turquoise module, blue line: YE_turquose module]\nWe observed strong overlap between the modules regulated by resveratrol and those regulated by interferon stimuli in Fig. 3b indicating potential suppression of the IFN mediated pathways by resveratrol. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis confirmed that the subset of genes regulated by resveratrol is enriched for genes involved in interferon signaling (Table\u00a01). Taken together, this shows that co-stimulation with LPS and resveratrol results in an intermediate activation state in which interferon signaling is ameliorated but other inflammatory signals remain high.Table 1\nGO terms associated with genes changed by resveratrol\nOne mechanism by which genes are co-regulated is via control by a common transcription factor. We used iRegulon [19] to identify transcription factors that may be acting as regulators of our gene modules. All modules showed strong association (Normalized Enrichment Score (NES)\u2009>\u20093 as defined by Janky et al., 2014) with at least one transcription factor. Six of the modules, BR_turquoise, BR_blue, PI_blue, CY_red, CY_turquoise and CY_brown, had transcription factors with particularly high NES (>\u20097), and these were predicted to regulate 72\u201387% of the genes in the module (Fig.\u00a05, Table\u00a02). The remaining three modules had associated transcription factors with 7\u2009>\u2009NES\u2009>\u20095, and the transcription factors were predicted to regulate 32\u201359% of the genes in their respective modules. Notably, there was little overlap in transcription factors between the modules. This segregation presents a potential biological mechanism for the modular nature of gene expression observed in our data.\n\nFig. 5\nCandidate transcription factors (TF) strongly associated with a module.

It is worth noting that only 15 of the 33 modules could be assessed for preservation, because the remaining modules did not show expression changes in response to LPS in vivo and most likely require a different stimulus. Of the 15 active modules, four modules showed module breakdown, where the module genes did not show correlated expression patterns. The remaining 11 modules were determined to be reproducible, that is, genes within these modules showed correlated expression changes in response to LPS in vivo. This indicates that, despite differences in gene expression at baseline, the modular architecture of gene expression was intact (Fig.\u00a06a-b).\n\nFig. 6\nModules derived in vitro can be observed in vivo (a-b) Representative modules upregulated [A] and downregulated [B] by LPS treatment in vivo and in vitro.

Pie chart [top] shows the proportion of genes from each list corresponding to a given module. Tables [bottom] show the list of genes and their module membership\nAging induces a primed phenotype in microglia [22], which is thought to be associated with chronic activation. We isolated microglia from 22-month old mice and compared their gene expression to that of the LPS-treated mice. Comparison of the most active modules in the two conditions revealed a differential response; LPS treatment most strongly involved modules CY_brown, CY_red, PU_turquoise, PI_blue, and CY_turquoise, whereas in aging, the primary modules were CY_yellow, BR_turquoise, and CY_turquoise (Fig.\u00a07a, left). Notably, this differential activation was also observed in vitro with acute (4\u2009h) or chronic (72\u2009h) LPS treatment respectively (Fig. 7a, right). Upon prolonged exposure to LPS in vitro, the microglial transcriptional response shifted from stronger activation of CY_red, PI_blue, and PI_brown modules to activation of BR_turquoise, CY_turquoise, and CY_yellow modules. To determine whether other chronic stimuli could also model the aged phenotype, we examined module activation in seven additional chronic stimulation conditions. Heirarchical clustering shows that, with the exception of LPS, no individual stimulus induced all three of the top aging-associated modules. However, we observed that of these three modules \u2013 CY_yellow, CY_turquoise, and BR_turquoise \u2013 two are strongly induced by chronic P3C stimulation and one is strongly induced by chronic IFN type I stimulation, indicating that each may contribute to part of the aging phenotype. Indeed, when P3C and IFNb were both included in a combined stimulus, this more closely recapitulated the aged phenotype (Fig. 7b).\n\nFig. 7\nModules distinguish between acute inflammation and aging in vivo. a Heatmap of median differential expression of module genes comparing acute and chronic conditions in vitro and in vivo. Values are normalized by condition. b Hierarchical clustering of median differential expression value of modules showing similarities between the in vivo aged condition and eight in vitro chronic stimulation conditions. Values are normalized by condition. c Enrichment maps for pathways regulated by LPS treatment [left] or aging [right]\nPathway analysis revealed the biological processes associated with the top modules activated in each condition (Fig. 7c). Modules activated in microglia from LPS treated animals were enriched for pathways related to proliferation, chemotaxis, reactive oxygen species production, and cytokine production. In contrast, modules in aging microglia were enriched for IFNa and IFNb signaling, and response to viral infection. Our analysis demonstrates the utility of gene expression modules to robustly detect different activation states of microglia in vivo, in this case acute inflammation and aging. As modules correspond to known stimuli and defined transcriptional activators, differences in module activation provide information on signaling involved in each microglia activation state (Fig. 8). Finally, we show that some aspects of aged microglia in vivo can be recapitulated during chronic stimulation in vitro.\n\nFig. 8\nGene modules distinguish between many different microglial states. Module activation patterns characterize microglia in various states. Hub gene markers of each modules can be used in a combinatorial code that distinguishes between states.

Foxtail millet (Setaria italic L.) is an important fodder grain crop in arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa because of its strong tolerance to drought and barren stresses. The molecular mechanisms of physiological and biochemical responses and regulations to various abiotic stresses such as low potassium conditions in foxtail millet are not fully understood, which hinders the research and exploitation of this valuable resource.In this research, we demonstrated that the millet variety Longgu 25 was the most insensitive variety to low potassium stress among other five varieties. The transcriptome analysis of Longgu 25 variety revealed a total of 26,192 and 26,849 genes from the K+-deficient and normal transcriptomic libraries by RNA-seq, respectively. A total of 1982 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified including 866 up-regulated genes and 1116 down-regulated genes. We conducted a comparative analysis of these DEGs under low-K+ stress conditions and discovered 248 common DEGs for potassium deprivation among foxtail millet, rice and Arabidopsis. Further Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis identified a series of candidate genes that may involve in K+-deficient response and in intersection of molecular functions among foxtail millet, rice and Arabidopsis. The expression profiles of randomly selected 18 candidate genes were confirmed as true DEGs with RT-qPCR. Furthermore, one of the 18 DEGs, SiMYB3, is specifically expressed only in the millet under low-K+ stress conditions. Overexpression of SiMYB3 promoted the main root elongation and improved K+ deficiency tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. The fresh weight of the transgenic plants was higher, the primary root length was longer and the root surface-area was larger than those of control plants after K+ deficiency treatments.This study provides a global view of transcriptomic resources relevant to the K+-deficient tolerance in foxtail millet, and shows that SiMYB3 is a valuable genetic resource for the improvement of K+ deficiency tolerance in foxtail millet.Potassium (K) is one of the essential macronutrients required for plant growth and development and involves in many important physiological processes in plant cells, including osmoregulation, turgor pressure control, electrical neutralization, and enzyme activation [1]. Previous studies have reported that K+ deficiency is a key abiotic stress factor in plants [2\u20134]. In soil, the K+ concentration is generally within the range of 1 to 200\u2009ppm (approx. 0.025 ~\u20095\u2009mM) [5]. However, the K+ concentration in the rhizosphere is usually less than 0.3\u2009mM, and K+ is deficient in large areas of cultivated land [6, 7]. Therefore, most plants are subjected to low K+ stress at some points during their development. Plants possess multiple K+ uptake systems (transporters and channels) with different K+ affinities and transportation activities to absorb adequate amounts of K+ from soil. In general, K+ channels mediate low-affinity K+ uptakes, and K+ transporters conduct high-affinity K+ uptakes. Transcriptional regulation is an important mechanism of plants in response to low-K+ stress [8\u201310]. For example, the expressions of several members of the KUP/HAK/KT family AtHAK5 [11], AtKUP3 [12], OsHAK1 [13], HvHAK1 [14, 15], as well as K+ transporter genes AtCHX17 [16] and TaAKT1 [17] were induced by K+ starvation. These K+ transporters may involve in K+ acquisition and homeostasis in plant cells under low-K+ conditions. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of Arabidopsis plants under low-K+ stress identified many candidate genes related to low-K+ perception and regulatory pathways associated with the response to K+ deficiency [18]. In rice, OsAKT1 is the main inward rectifying K+ channel in roots [19] and contributes considerably to K+ uptake at a wide range of external K+ concentrations, overexpression of OsAKT1 enhanced K+ uptake, which is beneficial in both K+-deficient and water-stress conditions [20]. Although considerable work has been done to understand the mechanisms of the plant response to K+ deficiency, an extensive work is still needed in crop plants to understand the detail mechanisms of K+ nutrition and signaling.Foxtail millet Setaria italic (Poales, Poaceae) is an important C4 panicoid crop in arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa due to its strong tolerance to drought and barren stresses. In addition, it possesses several salient attributes such as small genome (~\u2009515\u2009Mb; 2n\u2009=\u20092\u00d7=18) with a relatively lower repetitive DNA, an inbreeding nature and a short life cycle. Its genome has been sequenced by two independent groups namely the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) and China-US Department of Energy-Joint Genome Initiative (JGI) [21, 22]. So, foxtail millet has become an ideal material of monocotyledon to study the mechanisms of plant stress tolerance [23]. The availability of genome sequences in public databases has encouraged the foxtail millet research community to perform high throughput investigations in the aspects of functional genomics [24\u201326]. There are about 27,059 catalogued accessions germplasm resources [27]. However, they are not widely used in the functional analysis of important genes, particularly, in the research related to the functional genomics of K+ sensing, uptake, distribution and homeostasis in foxtail millet. As monocotyledon, it is meaningful to compare transcriptomic changes among foxtail millet, rice and Arabidopsis under low-K+ stress to gain insights into which mechanisms are shared and which are specific to each plant species.RNA-Seq technology has already been broadly utilized in the study of differential gene expression during plant responses to various biological and nonbiological stresses [28]. In the present study, we report such comparative RNA-seq study for the first time to further understand the complexity of foxtail millet under K+ deficiency at the whole transcriptome level. We found that there is a significant difference in K+ deficiency tolerance between 6 foxtail millet varieties, which have different characteristics of tolerance levels to drought and barren stresses and a wide adaptability in China, and discovered a K+ efficient variety Longgu 25. Then, we used RNA-Seq technology to monitor the transcriptomic profiles of the foxtail millet variety in responses to K+ deficiency. We analyzed the functional categorization of differentially expressed genes and compared the low-K+ response profiles between normal and K+ deficiency treatments. Using the published data, we compared the differences in the gene expression profiles of rice, Arabidopsis and foxtail millet under potassium deprivation, and found 248 common genes and 1734 foxtail millet specific genes. Overexpression of one of these millet specific genes SiMYB3 in Arabidopsis enhanced K+ deficiency tolerance.Correlation analysis of gene expression levels among samples is the key criterion to test whether the results are reliable and the collection of samples is reasonable. Based on the FPKM results, the correlation efficiencies among three replicates were calculated, where the square of the correlation efficiencies was greater than 0.93. Results showed that the experiment has good repeatability. To check if there is any difference in the gene expression, which may affect the phenotypic differences observed under K+ deficient conditions, we compared the RPKM-derived read counts and found 1982 genes expressed differentially between CK and LK samples, among them 866 up-regulated and 1116 down-regulated under the LK condition (Additional file 1: Table S3).Foxtail millet tolerates low soil fertility conditions and can achieve satisfactory yields in soils with low mineral levels [30]. However, the mechanism at transcription level underlying the tolerance against K+ deficiency in foxtail millet is unknown. There are very few studies reporting the gene transcriptional changes in foxtail millet for the absorption and transportation of potassium under low-K stress conditions [23]. The objective of the present study was to make a preliminary exploration at the transcript expression of foxtail millet genes under low-K+ stress conditions and to provide information on the mechanism behind their regulation and the transcriptomic profiling of foxtail millet seedling in response to low-K+ stress by use of RNA-Seq approach. Ma et al. (2012) used the GO analysis to compare and to analyze transcriptomic differences between rice and Arabidopsis under low-K+ stresses and found that the genes showing transcriptional changes in rice and Arabidopsis displayed similar GO distribution patterns in their responses to low-K+ stress [29]. In our experiments, the differentially expressed genes (DEG) were screened under CK and LK conditions. In our study, we found 1982 DEGs between the CK and LK samples, 248 DEGs are common among foxtail millet, rice and Arabidopsis, such as such as CIPK9 (CBL-INTERACTING PROTEIN KINASE 9), HAK5 (HIGH AFFINITY K+ TRANSPORTER 5), CYP family proteins etc. Especially HAK5, which is the major contributors to K+ uptake system in Arabidopsis thaliana [11]; And 1734 DEGs are specific to foxtail millet, including MYB, AP2, WRKY, BZIP transcription factors, etc., which may be the reason why Longgu 25 variety has good characteristics of low potassium tolerance, so the development and utilization of these genes as molecular markers can be the effective means for us to cultivate low potassium tolerance varieties. Therefore, these specific genes may be the focus of further research.Responses against K+ deficiency may initiate many molecular processes such as catalytic activity, binding, transporter activity and nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity (Fig. 4). Transgenic plants produced by over-expression of functional genes have shown to be able to improve K+ deficiency tolerance. But, the progress in this area of research is hampered by limited availability of candidate genes with significant effect on LK phenotypes. This may be due to the lack of complete understanding of the molecular basis of K+ deficient tolerance and of the involvement of a complex network of genes operating in close coordination. Identifying novel genes, analyzing their expression patterns in response to K+ deficiency and determining their potential functions in the adaptation for K+ deficiency will provide the basis for effective genetic engineering strategies to enhance tolerance against K+ deficiency [31]. Our finding of several transcription factors in DEGs is significant. Plant-specific transcription factors play vital roles in the activation of genes associated with stress-tolerance [32]. Transcriptional control of the expression of stress-responsive genes is a crucial part of the plant response to a range of abiotic and biotic stresses. This means that transcription factors may contribute to the complexity and overlap in their responses to different stressors, and research of these factors is likely to lead to new ways of enhancing crop tolerance to environmental stress [33]. Some transcription factors are related to the development of potassium-related metabolic pathways [34]. Approximately 6 and 4% genes are transcription factors in Arabidopsis and rice, which divide into 56 and 58 transcription factor families, respectively, and the bHLH family is the largest family. In our DEGs, there are 13 families (Fig. 3, Additional file 1: Table S4), and the MYB TF family contains the largest number of DEGs (i.e., Si012660m.g, Si008086m.g, etc. Additional file 1: Table S5). The MYB transcription factors comprise of the largest transcription factor family in plants and play key roles in plant development, secondary metabolism, hormone signal transduction, disease resistance and abiotic stress tolerance [35\u201337]. This indicates that the foxtail millet MYB family genes may be responsive to the K-stress. Our current study identified new genes with RNA-Seq such as SiMYB3, a member of the MYB family, its overexpression significantly promotes the main root elongation and improves K+ deficiency tolerance in transgenic plants (Fig. 8). This is an extension of the function of MYB transcription factors. Because, to date, most reports suggest that MYB transcription factors can enhance the tolerance of plants to low temperature and drought. There have been few reports of its ability to increase K+ deficiency tolerance. For example, the overexpression of ScT36 (an MYB-like transcription factor) in transgenic Arabidopsis resulted in enhanced cold tolerance [38], the overexpressing rice OsMYB3R2 led to stronger cold tolerance and an increased mitotic index in transgenic rice [39], and the enhanced freezing-stress tolerance was observed in Arabidopsis overexpressing OsMYB4 [40]. Transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing AtMYB15 exhibited hypersensitivity to exogenous ABA and improved drought and cold tolerance [41, 42]. Therefore, SiMYB3 can be a useful gene in improving K+ deficiency tolerance for other crops. However, further research is required to explore molecular mechanisms and regulations of SiMYB3 under K+ deficiency.In addition, 11 of 84 differentially expressed TF genes are the AP2 family proteins. Many AP2 transcription factors can activate genes in response to abiotic stress and are involved in the abscisic acid (ABA) response [43, 44]. In our study, 8 out of 10 NAC family genes (i.e., Si036535m.g, Si010053m.g, etc.) were found to be upregulated in K+ deficiency condition. We speculated that these genes may indirectly regulate potassium channels involved in different K-metabolic pathways in foxtail millet.Our data have substantially improved the global view of the foxtail millet transcriptome and paved the way for its further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying responses to K+ deficiency. SiMYB3 is a valuable genetic resource of abiotic stress in foxtail millet.Sterilized seeds of 6 foxtail millet varieties (Setaria italic. cv. Longgu 25, Shiliuzi, Hongmiaodabaigu, Jigu19, Jiugu14, Changnong40) were obtained from Professor Diao Xianmin of the Institute of Crop Sciences, China Academy of Agricultural Sciences and pregerminated on moistened filter papers in a plant growth chamber under the condition of 16\u2009h light/8\u2009h dark (21\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u2009\u00b0C) photoperiod with 65% humidity for 4\u2009days. Then the seedlings were transferred into plastic pots with modified Hoagland nutrient solution (4\u2009mM Ca(NO3)2, 6\u2009mM KNO3, 1.9\u2009mM MgSO4, 0.9\u2009mM (NH4)2HPO4, 100\u2009\u03bcM FeSO4\u00b77H2O, 100\u2009\u03bcM EDTA-2Na, 10\u2009\u03bcM MnCl2, 1\u2009\u03bcM CuSO4\u00b75H2O, 1\u2009\u03bcM ZnSO4\u00b77H2O, 30\u2009\u03bcM H3BO3, 0.03\u2009\u03bcM (NH4)6Mo7O24\u00b77H2O, pH\u20095.5). When the plants reached the 4-leaf stage, half of them were transferred to Hoagland nutrient solution with 10\u2009\u03bcM\u2009K+ as the K+-deficient treatment (LK) supplemented with NH4Cl as the nitrogen source. Another half of the plants were transferred to a normal solution (6\u2009mM\u2009K+) as control (CK). The nutrition solution was refreshed every 2\u2009days. The plants were harvested in three biological replicates 10\u2009days after the treatments for further assays.The foxtail millet seedlings of every variety grown in normal (CK) and potassium deficient (LK) condition were weighted (shoots and roots separately) before (fresh weight) and after (dry weight) dried at 80\u2009\u00b0C for 48\u2009h. The shoot-root ratio is equal to the length of shoot over the length of the root. To measure K+ content, the dry samples were incinerated in a muffle furnace at 575\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009h, the residue was dissolved in 0.1\u2009N HCl, and the K+ content was measured by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer. Relative Index\u2009=\u2009XLK/XCK; where XLK and XCK are the total value of dry weight, ground biomass and K accumulation in shoot under LK condition and CK condition, respectively. Three biological replicates were used for the biomass and K+ content measurements. The t-test was used to analyze the statistical significance (* P\u2009<\u20090.05, ** P\u2009<\u20090.01).Fresh roots of both control and treated foxtail millet seedlings (cv.Longgu 25) were collected, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u2212\u200980\u2009\u00b0C until RNA extractions. Every RNA sample was extracted from five independent seedlings. Extracted RNA was stored at \u2212\u200980\u2009\u00b0C until it was used for transcriptome sequencing and real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) validation. Three biological replicates were used for the RNA-Seq experiments. For Illumina sequencing, the total RNA was extracted from every sample using Trizol (Invitrogen) and treated with RNase-free DNase I (TaKaRa) for 45\u2009min according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The poly (A+) mRNA was purified from 20\u2009mg of the total RNA samples using Sera-mag Magnetic Oligo(dT) Beads (Illumina). Because RNA fragmentation produces a more even sequence read distribution than cDNA fragmentation [45], the mRNA was first sheared into short fragments using an RNA fragmentation kit (Ambion) before cDNA synthesis. Using these short mRNA fragments as templates, first strand cDNAs were synthesized using random hexamer primers and the reverse transcriptase of the kit (Invitrogen). The second-strand cDNA was synthesized using DNA polymerase I, followed by the RNase H treatment to remove the RNAs. For high-throughput sequencing, the sequence libraries were constructed following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Illumina). Fragments of ~\u2009300\u2009bp were excised and enriched by PCR for 18\u2009cycles. The products were loaded onto flow cell channels at a concentration of 2 pM for pair-end 90\u2009bp\u2009\u00d7\u20092 sequencing. The Illumina HiSeq\u2122 2000 platform was used for the sequencing.After removing the sequence reads containing sequencing adapters and low-quality sequence reads (reads containing more than 5% unknown bases or more than half of their bases with a quality of less than 5) using the FASTX-Toolkit software (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/). Biological replicates are required for almost every biological experiment, including high-throughput sequencing. If one sample is highly similar with another one, the correlation value between them is very close to 1. To assess the biological replicates, a Spearman correlation analysis of the log2-transformed FPKM values was performed. We aligned the reads to the foxtail millet genome (Phytozome v10.0.4) and annotated genes (http://brassicadb.org/brad/) using the SOAP aligner/soap2 software [46], allowing up to five mismatches. In addition, the annotated exons from the foxtail millet genome were used as reference genes to assign each read to a specific gene.The gene expression was calculated according to the method of RPKM (reads per kb per million reads) [47]. To identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between two libraries, a protocol from Audic and Claverie [48] was used. The false discovery rate (FDR) was used to determine the threshold of the p-value in multiple tests. The threshold of FDR\u2009\u2264\u20090.001 and an absolute value of log2Ratio\u2009\u2265\u20091 or log2Ratio\u2009\u2264\u2009\u2212\u20091 were used to judge the significance of the gene expression differences [49].The DEGs were subjected to a gene ontology (GO) analysis. For the GO analysis, the DEGs were first mapped to the GO terms in the database (http://www.geneontology.org/), the gene number was then calculated for every term, and the ultra-geometric test was used to find significantly enriched GO terms in the DEGs compared to the genome background. The p-value was calculated and determined using the Bonferroni correction, taking the corrected-p-value\u22640.05 as a threshold for significance. The GO terms satisfying these conditions are defined as significantly enriched GO terms in the DEGs.To investigate the common pathway in response to the potassium deficiency in plants, firstly we download the DEGs of Arabidopsis [11] and the rice cultivar Nipponbare [29] under potassium deficiency conditions, and then we aligned our DEGs against those from Arabidopsis and rice by BLASTP program with e-value less than 1e\u2212\u200910. For the common DEGs, the GO enrichment analysis was carried out using the BINGO program [50] with the FDR less than 0.05.Real-time quantitative PCR was performed on the randomly selected eighteen DEGs in response to potassium deficiency. The extracted RNA samples were used for real-time quantitative PCR to ensure the reliability and repeatability of the results. To eliminate genomic DNA contamination, total RNA was treated with DNase I (RNase Free) (Takara, Dalian, China) and then used to synthesize cDNA by a reverse transcription reaction using random primers (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Three biological replicates were performed using the Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) on the 7500 Real Time PCR System machine (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. The PCR-cycling conditions comprised of an initial polymerase activation step at 95\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009min, followed by 40\u2009cycles at 95\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009s, 60\u2009\u00b0C for 20\u2009s and 72\u2009\u00b0C for 32\u2009s. After each PCR run, a dissociation curve was measured to check the specificity of the product and the production of primer dimers. The relative amounts of the amplified products were calculated based on the standard curves generated by using standard cDNAs of known concentrations. The gene-specific primers (Additional file 1: Table S1) were designed using DNAMAN. The amplification of SiActin (Si001873m.g) was used as an internal control to normalize the data.Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) from 14-d-old seedlings of Longgu 25 variety. RNA quality and quantity were analyzed by electrophoresis and spectrophotometry. For cDNA synthesis, 1\u2009\u03bcg of total RNA was used for reverse transcription with FastKing RT Kit (with gDNase) (Tiangen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. The coding region sequence of SiMYB3 with a total size of 948\u2009bp was amplified with the PrimeSTAR DNA polymerase PCR kit (Clontech Takara) and primers 5\u2019-TAGAGGATCCCCGGGATGGGGAGGTCGCCGT-3\u2032 and 5\u2019-AGTGGATCCCCCGGGTCATAGTGGCAAGCTG-3\u2032. The fragment obtained was subcloned into pBI121 at SmaI site, and constructs were verified by sequencing.Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 was used as the wild type (WT) for all experiments carried out in this study. For phenotypic analysis, if not indicated differently, plants were cultivated in a growth room with long-day growth conditions (16\u2009h white light, 80\u2013100\u2009\u03bcmol\u2022m-2\u2022s\u2212\u20091/8\u2009h dark) at 21\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u2009\u00b0C. To construct expression vectors for the transformation of Arabidopsis plants, SiMYB3 gene was ligated into the vector pBI121 under control of the CaMV35S promoter. Flower-budding Arabidopsis Col-0 plants were transformed using the floral dip method under vacuum conditions as described previously [51]. T3 transgenic plants were identified by RT-qPCR and repeated with at least three independent plants. Primers were 5\u2032-GGCAAACAGGGAGAAGATGA-3\u2019and 5\u2032- GGCAAACAGGGAGAAGATGA-3\u2032 for actin; 5\u2032-AACTGAACGCCGCTTCATC-3\u2019and 5\u2032- GCTGCTCTCTGCTAGCATGTC-3\u2032 for SiMYB3. The reaction was performed under the following conditions: 3\u2009min denaturation at 94\u2009\u00b0C; then 40\u2009cycles of 10\u2009s at 94\u2009\u00b0C, 20\u2009s at 60\u2009\u00b0C and 32\u2009s at 72\u2009\u00b0C. Then positive transgenic plants were used for further analysis. Transgenic and wildtype (WT) Arabidopsis plants were subjected to LK treatments and control (MS0). Fifty plants of each line were used for the stress treatment. And then plants were subjected to the measurements of fresh weight, primary root length and root surface-area.APETALA2the Beijing Genomics InstituteBasic Helix-Loop-HelixBasic region leucine zipperControlDifferentially expressed genesThe false discovery rateGene OntologyChina-US Department of Energy-Joint Genome InitiativePotassiumthe Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and GenomesPotassium deficientv-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homologNAM/ATAF1/2/CUC1/2Reads per kb per million readsTranscription factorWildtypeThis work was supported by Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation, China (ZR2016CQ33); The National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFD0101802, 2016YFE0108600); the Yong Talents Training Program of Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences and Agricultural scientific and technological innovation project of Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CXGC2018E13).The datasets generated and analyzed during the current study are available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/) (accession number:SRA048234 [21]).

The lowest shoot-root ratio is 4.26 (Table 1). However, there was no phenotypic difference for Longgu 25 variety (Fig.\u00a01). The shoot-root ratio of Longgu 25 was 6.01, the highest among all varieties (Table 1). There was a significant difference in total dry weight and the ground biomass between different varieties. The relative index (XLK/XCK) of total dry weight (0.87) and the ground biomass (0.85) of Longgu 25 was the highest in all varieties (Table 1). There was no significant difference in the shoot K+ content between different varieties after the LK stress treatment (Table 1). So, Longgu 25 was selected for further study as the tolerant variety for K+ deficiency.Table 1\nTotal dry weight, the ground biomass and K+ content in shoot of different varieties in the K+ deficient (LK) and normal condition\n\n\nFig. 1\nDifferential responses of six foxtail millet varieties to K+ deficiency during seedling growth stage. The seedlings were transferred to modified Hoagland nutrient solution with 10\u2009\u03bcM\u2009K as the K+-deficient treatment (LK) supplemented with NH4Cl as the nitrogen source. The plants grown in normal media (CK) are shown on right and the plants experienced K+ deficiency (LK) are shown on left\nTo obtain a global view of transcriptome profiles relevant to the K+-deficient treatment in Chinese foxtail millet variety Longgu 25, the high throughput RNA-Seq analyses on poly(A+)-enriched RNAs from the untreated (CK) and LK libraries were performed using the Solexa/Illumina platform. After filtering out the low-complexity reads, the low-quality reads and the repetitive reads, 26,666,736 usable reads for the CK plants and 26,665,015 usable reads for the LK plants were obtained (Table 2). Of the total reads, 71.47% of the LK reads matched to unique (54.92%) or multiple (16.55%) genome locations, however, 77.34% of the CK reads matched to unique (44.27%) or multiple (33.07%) genome locations (Table 2). As listed in Table 2, approximately 40.17% of the LK reads and 31.27% of the CK reads were mapped to unique genes, and 16.53% of the LK reads and 12.49% of the CK reads were mapped to multiple reference genes (Additional file 1: Table S2).Table 2\nNumber of assembly reads sequenced and mapped to the genome and genes\nTo evaluate potential functions of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to K+ deficiency, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was performed by mapping each DEG into the records of the GO database (http://www.geneontology.org/). Under the biological process category, 21 GO categories were significantly enriched (corrected p-value\u22640.05) (Fig.\u00a02; Additional file 1: Table S4). Many genes that respond to various processes and stimuli were prominently represented, suggesting that these processes and stimuli may relate to the response of K+ deficiency. For the cellular component category (13 GO categories) (Fig. 2; Additional file 1: Table S4), most of the DEGs were associated with cell, cell part, organelle and membrane. Under the category of molecular function (12 GO categories) (Fig. 2; Additional file 1: Table S4), the main functional groups of the DEGs were genes with catalytic activity and activities of binding, transporter and nucleic acid binding of transcription factor (TF).\n\nFig. 2\nGene Ontology (GO) functional annotation of DEGs. All transcripts were assigned to at least one GO term and grouped into three main GO categories and 46 subcategories, including 21 categories in biological process, 13 in cellular component, and 12 in molecular function. The Y-axis represents the number of genes in a sub-category\nInterestedly, we detected the differential expression of 84 genes encoding for TFs under K+ deficiency conditions in foxtail millet, including 41 up-regulated and 43 down-regulated TF genes (Fig.\u00a03 and Additional file 1: Table S5). TFs are the regulatory proteins, which play a key role in stress responses. Among the various families, the largest number of differentially expressed TFs was in the v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (MYB) TF family (24%). The members of other TF families, including APETALA2 (AP2) (13%), NAM/ATAF1/2/CUC1/2 (NAC) (12%), Homeobox (12%), basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) (8%), WRKY (7%) and basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) (6%), were also highly represented in the DEGs (Additional file 1: Table S5).\n\nFig. 3\nDistribution of transcription factor families differentially expressed in foxtail millet seedlings under the K+ deficient condition\nTo identify the pathways in which the DEGs are likely to be involved, we performed the pathway analysis with the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. The formula used to determine the number of the DEGs in each pathway is the same as that used in the GO analysis. The analysis arranged 1982 DEGs to 103 KEGG pathways; top 20 pathways are shown Fig.\u00a04. The greatest numbers of the DEGs were in metabolic pathways (268 members) and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (205 members). The DEGs were also mapped to plant-pathogen interaction, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis.\n\nFig. 4\nDEG enrichment analysis of 20 (A-T) main pathways under low potassium stress. The x-axes represent the category of each pathway. The y-axes represent the number of genes in pathway analysis\nTranscriptome data from this study was compared with the published transcriptome data of Arabidopsis and rice on the response to potassium deficiency [11, 29]. Generally, the genes showing transcriptional changes in foxtail millet, rice and Arabidopsis in response to low-K+ stress displayed similar GO distribution patterns. The results indicate that genes in the categories of metabolic process may play crucial roles in responses to low-K+ stress among foxtail millet, rice and Arabidopsis. A total of 248 DEGs are common for potassium deprivation among foxtail millet, rice and Arabidopsis (Additional file 1: Table S6). Further GO enrichment analysis showed that some basic low potassium corresponding genetic pathways are consistent among plants under the condition of low potassium, such as binding pathway (Fig.\u00a05), and that there may be a functional overlapping of these genes in responses to potassium deprivation in foxtail millet, rice and Arabidopsis. However, we also found that a total of 1734 DEGs was only expressed in foxtail millet under the condition of low potassium (Additional file 1: Table S7).\n\nFig. 5\nGO enrichment analysis of the potassium deprivation responding genes shared among Arabidopsis, rice, and millet. A Cytoscape view of enriched GO in biological process (a), molecular function (b), and cellular component (c). The colors of the node represent GO terms enriched in the targets. White nodes represent nonenriched GO terms to show the hierarchical relationship between the enriched ontology branches. Enrichment significance levels are P-value <\u20090.05 and FDR\u2009<\u20090.05\nTo validate the DEGs, RT-qPCR analyses were performed using gene-specific primers for randomly selected 12 up-regulated and 6 down-regulated genes in the LK samples, which were identified by differential screening based on the Illumina sequencing technology (Additional file 1: Table S1). The results showed that all 18 DEGs exhibited the same expression profiles as measured in the transcriptome analysis (Fig.\u00a06). The transcript of one gene SiMYB3 (gene ID: Si012660m.g, the sequence of SiMYB3 in Additional file 2: Text S1.) was highly up-regulated under the LK condition, which suggests that the expression of SiMYB3 is induced by and responsive to the LK stress. SiMYB3 was expressed only in foxtail millet and not in rice and Arabidopsis (Additional file 1: Table S7). Furthermore, in the T3 transgenic Arabidopsis plants, SiMYB3 was overexpressed and detected by RT-qPCR in two lines (OE1 and OE2) but comparatively much less or no expression in the control plants (WT) (Fig.\u00a07).\n\nFig. 6\nComparison of the expressing profiles for selected DEGs between RT-qPCR analysis and RNA-Seq results. To confirm the reliability of Illumina sequencing technology, 18 candidate genes were randomly selected and their expressions were confirmed by RT-qPCR using RT-primers. Differential expression was observed for all the candidate genes, indicating that they are involved in the regulatory networks that are active during low-K stress condition. The results of RT-qPCR showed that the RT-qPCR assessments of these 18 genes were consistent with those of sequencing analysis\n\n\nFig. 7\nRelative expression of SiMYB3 in the wildtype (WT), transgenic lines (OE1 and OE2) of Arabidopsis plants by RT-qPCR\nTo investigate whether SiMYB3 plays a role in response to LK stress, transgenic (OE1 and OE2) and control wildtype (WT) Arabidopsis plants were subjected to CK and LK treatments. Under the CK conditions, there was no difference in development and growth between the transgenic and WT Arabidopsis plants. Under the LK conditions, the seedlings grown in potassium deficient media reduced shoot and root growth for WT Arabidopsis plants, and the transgenic Arabidopsis plants had higher fresh weight, longer primary root length and larger root surface-area than WT after K+ deficiency treatment (Fig.\u00a08). These data suggest that the SiMYB3 overexpression can promote the main root elongation and improve K+ deficiency tolerance in the transgenic plants. So SiMYB3 may be involved in root development and K+ absorption.\n\nFig. 8\nPhenotype analysis of transgenic lines during seedling stage under low potassium concentrations. a control; b Treatment under 10\u2009\u03bcmol low potassium; c, d and e fresh weight, primary root length and root surface area under control and low potassium treatment, respectively.

Different muscles have very different meat quality traits and a study of the myogenic process in satellite cells can help us better understand the genes and pathways that regulate this process and how muscles differentiate.Cell cultures of Longissimus dorsi muscle differentiated from myoblast into multinucleated myotubes faster than semimembranosus. Time-series RNA-seq identified a total of 13 differentially expressed genes between the two muscles during their development. These genes seem to be involved in determining muscle lineage development and appear to modulate the expression of myogenic regulatory factors (mainly MYOD and MYF5) during differentiation of satellite cells into multinucleate myotubes. Gene ontology enriched terms were consistent with the morphological changes observed in the histology. Most of the over-represented terms and genes expressed during myoblast differentiation were similar regardless of muscle type which indicates a highly conserved myogenic process albeit the rates of differentiation being different. There were more differences in the enriched GO terms during the end of proliferation compared to myoblast differentiation.The use of satellite cells from newborn Hanwoo calves appears to be a good model to study embryonic myogenesis in muscle. Our findings provide evidence that the differential expression of HOXB2, HOXB4, HOXB9, HOXC8, FOXD1, IGFN1, ZIC2, ZIC4, HOXA11, HOXC11, PITX1, SIM2 and TBX4 genes could be involved in the differentiation of Longissimus dorsi and Semimembranosus muscles. These genes seem to modulate the muscle fate of the satellite cells during myogenesis through a differential expression profile that also controls the expression of some myogenic regulatory factors (MYOD and MYF5). The number of differentially expressed genes across time was unsurprisingly large. In relation to the baseline day 0, there were 631, 155, 175, 519 and 586 DE genes in LD, while in SM we found 204, 0, 615, 761 and 1154 DE genes at days 1, 2, 4, 7 and 14 respectively.The Korean Hanwoo cattle is known for its meat quality and high marbling ability (intramuscular fat) [1]. Meat quality (e.g. juiciness, tenderness, flavor) is mainly determined by the structure of the meat and its fatty acid composition, both of which vary widely across muscle groups [1\u20133].Transcriptional analysis has been very useful to characterize gene expression differences in muscles from different breeds, with divergent phenotypes and across muscle groups [4]. It has also helped us understand the genetic mechanisms that underpin muscle development (myogenesis) [5] and how muscle developmental differences observed at the proteomic [6] and transcriptomic levels [7, 8] can affect production traits. Myogenesis is mainly controlled by the Myogenic Regulatory Factors (MRFs) that modulate myoblast proliferation, migration and fusion [9]. There are four MRFs (MYF5, MYOD, MRF4/MYF6, and MYOG), however there are also several other genes that contribute to the regulation of growth and differentiation [10] and there are still many unknowns surrounding the exact molecular mechanisms involved in muscle differentiation \u2013 particularly which genes change expression and when do these changes occur \u2013 that ultimately lead to the morphological and phenotypic differences observed across the different types of muscle.Satellite cells are myogenic stem cells with the potential to self-renew and produce differentiated progeny; for this reason, these cells play an essential role in postnatal growth, muscle regeneration and hypertrophy. Myogenesis of satellite cells is a good model to study changes in gene expression over time and how they relate to muscle proliferation and differentiation [7, 8, 11, 12]. The combination of RNA sequencing with histological techniques allows for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms mediating differentiation of satellite cells into different muscle types revealing their gene expression profile and regulatory mechanisms at specific differentiation stages. A better understanding of these mechanisms is important for developmental biology and can assist in the development of therapeutic protocols in muscle.In this study, muscle biopsies were performed on three Hanwoo calves to extract muscle satellite cells from Longissimus dorsi (LD) and Semimembranosus (SM). Cells from these two muscles were cultured and allowed to differentiate into myotubes. This process was studied using RNA-seq and morphological measurements across six time points. The main objective of this study was to describe the expression profile of genes during early muscle differentiation in Hanwoo and to find differentially expressed genes between LD and SM muscles that may be involved in modulating muscle fate. We found that the gene expression profile over time is similar in both muscles which indicates a highly conserved myogenic process. However, our results indicate that the two muscles differentiate at different rates and that 13 genes seem to be involved in determining the fate of the satellite cells into one muscle type or another. Identification of the biological triggers in the early stages of muscle development can be of value to understand the different characteristics of muscles in adult cattle.The expression of MYOD (myogenic differentiation 1) increased steeply after day 1 in LD. Expression levels were lower in SM and increases in expression were more gradual (Fig. 3). The increase of MYF6 (Myogenic Factor 6) mRNA is an indication of late differentiation which was observed from day 4 until day 14; here also a higher level of expression was observed in LD. MYOG (Myogenin) has a role in late differentiation [9] with the qPCR showing an increase in expression in both muscles from day 2 to day 14, and again a higher expression in LD. The higher expression of MYOD, MYF6 and MYOG in LD during the stage of late differentiation coincides with the faster differentiation observed in this muscle compared to SM (Fig. 2). The expression of PAX3, which is high during proliferation of satellite cells, was consistently low during the differentiation stages in LD, however, there was an increase in its expression on day 14 in SM. The myogenic marker IGF1 showed an increased expression from day 4 until day 14 (Fig. 3).The main enriched pathways related with muscle differentiation were: complement and coagulation cascades, cardiac muscle contraction, calcium signaling pathway, cell cycle and DNA replication. The enriched pathways from the differentially expressed genes are reported for each muscle and time point in the supplementary material (Additional file 6).Multiple genes have been identified in model organisms as being important to control the myogenic process. However, this is the first in vitro study to apply a time-series RNA-seq analysis to characterize the transcriptomic differences that occur during the differentiation processes of two distinct bovine MSC depots. Previous studies on bovine MSC have focused on the transcriptional differences in muscle proliferation rates [8], the last stage of differentiation or trans-differentiation of satellite cells [13] and the comparison of muscles [14]. Moreover, most studies have focused on the transcriptional differences between muscles [15], fat [16] or breeds [17] of adult animals.The myogenic process during embryonic development can be approximated by in vitro differentiation of MSC to provide us with a better understanding of the developmental differences between different muscles. We identified consistent differences in the expression of 13 genes (Fig. 5) by comparing Longissimus dorsi (LD) and Semimembranosus (SM) muscle satellite cells during the differentiation process which suggests that they could be involved in driving muscle compartmentalization. Up regulation of HOXB2, HOXB4, HOXB9, HOXC8, FOXD1, IGFN1, ZIC2 and ZIC4 genes in LD suggest their role in lineage development of MSC into trunk muscles. On the other hand, the higher expression of the genes HOXA11, HOXC11, PITX1, SIM2, and TBX4 in SM could be involved in the development of MSC into limb muscles.We did not test this in the study, but it is possible that epigenetic regulation during the embryonic development of LD and SM muscles as well as neighboring signals could have imprinted the MSC with specific methylation patterns that resulted in the observed differences in expression patterns during in vitro differentiation. Another study found similarly divergent expression in human abdominal adipose cells where the genes that showed higher expression were generally hypomethylated in the CpG regions and genes with lower expression had CpG regions more associated with hypermethylation when compared to gluteal cells [18]. In the same study, the gene HOXC11 was more expressed in the gluteal cells which lends support to its potential role in the development of limb structures. Epigenetic imprinting is essential for muscle regeneration [19] and to guide the asymmetric division of SC into specific cellular fates [20]. However, methylation studies with LD and SM MSC will be required to understand if there truly are epigenetic differences between these bovine muscle types and what role they play in muscle differentiation.The expression of HOX seems to be responsible for the correct development of muscles and regulation of muscle-specific genes in mature muscle tissue [21]. In chicken embryos the HOXA11 protein was found in myogenic precursor cells in the early limb bud and its expression gradually reduced as development progressed [22]. Also in chicken embryos, this gene is expressed at somite level 33\u201334 and overlaps with the hindlimb bud [23]. Forced expression of HOXA11 reduces the abundance of MYOD in the limb of embryo chickens and a similar repression of MYOD was observed in C2C12 cells transfected with HOXA11 [24]. The inhibiting action of HOXA11 upstream of MYOD could explain the higher expression of MYOD (Fig. 3) observed in LD in relation to SM due to the higher expression of HOXA11 in SM. After day 1, in both muscles, the expression of MYOD increased after the expression of HOXA11 went down (Additional file 4). These results suggest that HOXA11 can control the speed of differentiation depending of the origin of the muscle (in this case it promoted a delay in the differentiation of SM) which will guide the determination of different muscle types.Genes from the HOXC cluster (Homeobox C Cluster) were also reported in muscles where myoblast and myotubes showed differential methylation and that these genes present active promoters and enhancer domains that contain MYOD binding sites [25]. HOXC8 and HOXC11 were reported to be involved in the regulation of osteogenesis [26]. Recently it was suggested by [21] that only a subset of muscles may require HOXC8 protein for full activation of muscle-specific gene expression. In chicken and mouse embryos, the expression of HOXC8 lies in the trunk region posterior to the forelimb [23]. In mice embryos (E11.5) the gene HOXC11 was expressed on the rostral side of somite 27, the region involved in the development of hind limb buds [27]. However, the in-situ hybridization in chick embryos showed the location of HOXC11 at somite 36\u201337 mapping to the seventh sacral vertebrae at the posterior edge of the hindlimb [23].A study in chicken found that TBX4 seems to be involved in controlling limb identity [28] which supports our conclusion that TBX4 is involved in the regulation of SC differentiation into SM muscle. However, in mice embryos the gene TBX4 seems to regulate muscle and tendon patterning but has not been implicated in their development [29]. SIM2 also upregulated in SM has been shown to be expressed in mice and chicken embryonic limbs and with a higher expression in the ventral limb myoblast [30].In adult mice, the induced over expression of PITX1 led to significant body weight loss and muscle mass reduction which was primarily caused by muscle atrophy [31]. Using retroviral constructs for PITX1, PITX2 and PITX3 in satellite cells from mice, Knopp et al. [32] observed that the increased expression of the paired like homeodomain genes (PITX) suppressed the proliferation of myoblasts and increased the fusion into multinucleated myotubes during differentiation. In mice, Marcil et al. [27] generated double mutants for PITX1 and PITX2 \u2013 both mutant embryos lost some hind limb features and had smaller hind limb buds compared to the wild type [27]. In the same study, the expression of TBX4 (assessed by in situ hybridization) decreased around the hind limbs suggesting a role in the specification of hind limbs identity through a cascade that involved TBX4 and PITX1 as an upstream regulatory gene [27].The deficiency of HOXB4 reduces the capacity of hematopoietic stem cells to proliferate [33]. In myogenic progenitor cells the sub-region that contains HOXB4, HOXB5, HOXB6, HOXB7 and HOXB-AS3 is hypermethylated [25]. During chicken embryo development there are individual cells that express only a subset of the genes depending of the rhombomere of origin. The expression of HOXB4 was detected in rhombomere 7 while rhombomeres 4 and 5 express HOXB2 [34]. An in-situ hybridization study in chicken and mice associated the expression of HOXB4 with the anterior cervical vertebrae while HOXB9 was mapped to the posterior trunk [23].Pan et al. [35] used mice to show that the knockdown of ZIC2 resulted in a delay in the activation of MYF5 with a subsequent delay in MYOD, but the expression of PAX3 was not affected by the absence of ZIC2. This is comparable to our results, the expression of ZIC2 was higher in LD which could explain the increase of MYF5 in this muscle at days 0, 1 and 2 and subsequently the faster increase of MYOD in LD (Fig. 2). ZIC4 also had a higher expression in LD. During mouse embryogenesis the expression of ZIC4 is in the dorsal midline of the forebrain and in the dorsal spinal neural tube at E12.5, while at the mid-trunk level ZIC4 is restricted to the most dorsal part of the sclerotome and the dorsomedial dermomyotome [36].FOXD1 is another gene that has been associated with myogenesis control by regulating the expression of MRF. During the embryogenesis of flounder, the expression of FOXD1 at the 6 somite stage was found in adaxial cells and progenitor cells of the forebrain, midbrain and kidney [37]. Injection of mRNA FOXD1 reduced the speed of embryo development and the expression of MYOD in the somites, but the adaxial cells were not affected [37]. The negative effect of FOXD1 on MYOD was not clearly observed in our results (Fig. 3, Additional file 4), but there was however a negative correlation between the expression of these genes (\u2212\u20090.39). The correlation is stronger in LD (\u2212\u20090.65) than in SM (\u2212\u20090.17). The higher expression of FOXD1 in LD together with the possible dampening effect on the expression of MYOD suggests that FOXD1 may also be involved in muscle type differentiation.The bovine MSC presented a pattern of expression in the MRF genes similar to C2C12 mouse cells during differentiation. As in other studies, MYOD, MYF6 and MYOG were up-regulated during the differentiation of myoblast into myotubes. This was expected since MYOG reportedly regulates the fusion of myoblast into multinucleated muscle cells and MYF6 is expressed only in the last stage of the C2C12 mouse cell during differentiation [38]. A gene expression analysis of the goat muscle rectus abdominis reported that MYOD, MYOG and MYF6 were up-regulated while MYF5 was down-regulated in differentiated myotubes compared with proliferative myotubes [39]. It has also been reported that MYF6 began to be expressed during differentiation [40] and that the protein levels of MYOD, MYF5 and MYOG increased at day 10 of differentiation [12].We found the same pattern in the transcription levels of MYOG, MYOD and MYF6 for both muscles (but with a significantly higher expression in LD than in SM) indicating that the formation of multinucleated myotubes requires an increase in the expression of MYOD, MYOG and MYF6. Respectively, mRNA abundance levels for each gene started to increase on days 1, 2 and 4 and then remained high in the differentiated myotubes on day 14 (Fig. 3). In the case of MYF5, we observed a higher expression in LD on days 0, 1 and 2 with a slight reduction after day 2 in LD and day 4 in SM. In C2C12 myoblasts it was observed that the down-regulation of MYOG levels increased the levels of MYF5 [38] and in MYF5 null mice the differentiation is delayed at an early stage of regeneration [40]. In cattle, the down regulation of MYF5 seems to reduce the proliferation of myoblasts because it maintains satellite cell pools quiescent and reduces the number of activated satellite cells [8]. Together, the expression of these genes could explain the faster developmental differentiation of LD and its higher number of myotubes per area (Fig. 2).The expression of PAX3 was low but constant, suggesting that some myoblasts were still proliferating as previously reported in mice SC [41] or that it plays a role during the differentiation of bovine muscle. With IGF1, its mRNA abundance increased on days 4, 7 and 14, which was expected as the IGF1 hormone is one of the most important muscle growth factors secreted by myocytes [9].Overall, the GO enrichment analysis showed that most of the over-represented terms and genes expressed during myoblast differentiation were similar regardless of muscle type. We observed more differences in the enriched GO terms during the end of proliferation (day 0) compared to myoblast differentiation (days 4 and 7). At the beginning of the experiment, the terms cell cycle, proliferation and G2/M transition of mitotic (Fig. 6) had genes with higher expression, which agrees with the proliferation events that were occurring in the myoblasts. However, the expression of genes involved in these terms started to decrease in the other days due to the shift from cell division to cell differentiation, which is similar to results from previous studies in bovine [5].From day 2 and onwards the main enriched terms were actin cytoskeleton, myofibril assembly and muscle cell differentiation (Table 3). These changes agreed with the progress of myoblast differentiation and reflected the changes in cellular structure at the cytoskeleton level during myoblast fusion; similar GO terms were already previously reported [12]. Enriched cellular component terms myofibril and contractile fiber are in line with the work of Tripathi et al. [39]. The term inflammatory response was found significant on days 1 and 4 in LD and on days 4, 7 and 14 in SM, consistent with He and Liu [5] who connected it with a muscle regenerative process.The enrichment of genes (actinin alpha 2 \u2013 ACTN2, calpain 3 \u2013 CAPN3, myosin light chain 1 \u2013 MYL1, myosin light chain 2 \u2013 MYL2, complement C1s \u2013 C1S and troponin C1 \u2013 TNNC1) involved in calcium ion binding increased during the differentiation of myoblast into myotubes. During this stage, two main events require an increase in the flow of calcium (Ca++): 1) the fusion of myoblasts and 2) the development and organization of the contractile apparatus. In previous studies, it was suggested that the concentration of calcium ions influenced the fusion of myoblasts and therefore the number of nuclei in the myotubes of chicken [42]. On one side, Ca++ uptake increases before the fusion of the cytoplasmic vesicles with the cell membrane and acts as an intracellular stimulus [43]. On the other side, muscle contraction requires an increase in calcium-dependent cyclin proteins in order to increase the influx of Ca++ [44].The use of satellite cells from newborn Hanwoo calves appears to be a good model to study embryonic myogenesis in muscle. Our findings provide evidence that the differential expression of HOXB2, HOXB4, HOXB9, HOXC8, FOXD1, IGFN1, ZIC2, ZIC4, HOXA11, HOXC11, PITX1, SIM2 and TBX4 genes could be involved in the differentiation of Longissimus dorsi and Semimembranosus muscles. These genes seem to modulate the muscle fate of the satellite cells during myogenesis through a differential expression profile that also controls the expression of some myogenic regulatory factors (MYOD and MYF5). It is possible that the different profiles observed in the cell cultures are due to the origin of the satellite cells that where epigenetically imprinted during the embryonic development of Longissimus dorsi and Semimembranosus. However, epigenetic studies with LD and SM MSC will be required to understand if there truly are epigenetic differences between these bovine muscle types and what role they play in muscle differentiation.Satellite cells were isolated from Longissimus dorsi (LD) and Semimembranosus (SM) muscle samples of three unrelated Korean Hanwoo newborn calves to investigate gene expression changes during differentiation of myoblasts fusing into multinucleate myotubes. Tissues were collected from calves that died spontaneously during delivery from Hanwoo mothers belonging to the Hanwoo Research Institute\u2019s cattle herd (NIAS, Korea). The study was approved under the animal care and use protocols 2015\u2013112 and 2018\u2013319 by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institute of Animal Science, Korea.Satellite cells were then excised from the LD and SM tissues as previously described in [45, 46]. Briefly, the muscle samples were cut into 600\u2013700\u2009g pieces and transferred into a 1000\u2009ml beaker with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The samples were then transferred to a sterile area in a laboratory and the connective tissue was removed in the tissue culture hood. The muscles were then chopped up with sterile scissors and placed in satellite cell isolation buffer for incubation. Samples (250\u2009g) were incubated with 300\u2009ml of 0.1% pronase in Earl\u2019s Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS) for 1\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C with frequent mixing. Following incubation, the mixture was centrifuged at 1500 x g for 4\u2009min and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was suspended in phosphate-buffer saline (PBS; 140\u2009mM NaCL, 1\u2009mM KH2PO4, 3\u2009mM KCl, 8\u2009mM Na2HPO4) and the suspension was centrifuged at 500 x g for 10\u2009min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 1500 x g for 10\u2009min to pellet the mononucleated cells. The PBS was washed, and the differential centrifugation process was repeated another two times. Afterwards, the resultant mononucleated cell preparation was suspended in cold (4\u2009\u00b0C) Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) that contains 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10% (vol/vol) dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and frozen for subsequent studies.Hanwoo satellite cells from both LD and SM muscles were separately plated on 225-cm2 culture plates percolated with reduced growth factor basement membrane Matrigel, diluted 1:10 (vol/vol) with DMEM containing 10% FBS and incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C, 5% CO2 in a water-saturated environment. Plating density was 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells/ml so that all cultures were approximately 60 to 70% confluent after the incubation period. This ensured that the cell proliferation rate was not affected by contact inhibition. Cultures were fed at 48\u2009h with DMEM containing 10% FBS.Cultures that reached confluence (considered as day 0) were stimulated to differentiate with an induction medium that consisted of DMEM with 3% horse serum for 14\u2009days. Plates were triplicated for each sample for the RNA-seq and morphological analyses. Samples from the LD and SM satellite cell cultures from each of the three biological replicates were scrapped from the dishes at six time points (days 0, 1, 2, 4, 7 and 14) and transferred to NuncTM Cryobank Vial System tubes with 1\u2009ml capacity (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Samples were carefully frozen with liquid nitrogen and then stored at \u2212\u200980\u2009\u00b0C until RNA extraction.We performed Hematoxylin staining to determine the stages of differentiation and the differentiation index (at days 3, 4 and 7) of the culture plates for each muscle. The differentiation index is defined as the area, in percentage, occupied by the myotubes in the cultures. This index was calculated by calculating the area occupied by myotubes in at least five photographs taken from random fields of each plate. Photographs were taken using a Nikon NIS-elements (version 4.0; F-package) and Nikon Mi2 microscope with 20X phase-contrast objective. Differences in the index between LD and SM muscles at each time point were tested with an analysis of variance for a model fitting time (day), tissue and the interaction between time and tissue. P-values <\u20090.05 were considered significantly different.The differentiation of LD and SM muscle satellite cells (MSC) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry using a glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4; Abcam) antibody at days 0, 1 and 4 and a Myosin Light Chain (MLC; Abcam) antibody at day 7. Cultured cells were permeabilized using Triton 100 with PBS. Sections were blocked with a 10% goat serum in PBS, after which they were incubated with the GLUT4 and MLC antibody (20\u2009\u03bcl/mL, Abcam) for 1\u2009h. After washing with PBS for 5\u2009min, cultures were treated with the second antibody for another hour at room temperature and then, after PBS washing, stained with Hoechst (1.5\u03bcg/ml) for 1\u2009h. A negative control experiment was also carried out by omitting the antibody. Photographs were taken using a Nikon NIS-elements (version 4.0; F-package) and Nikon Mi2 microscope with 20X phase-contrast objective and a red filter. Nikon TRITC was used for wavelength detection from excitation 540 to barrier 605. The wavelength of secondary antibody (Alexa 568; Abcam 175,696) was between 578\u2009nm excitation and 603\u2009nm emission.RNA from the satellite cell cultures of the three Hanwoo calves was extracted from the LD and SM muscles for the six time points (days 0, 1, 2, 4, 7 and 14). Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). RNA quality and quantity were assessed using an automated capillary gel electrophoresis on a Bioanalyzer 2100 with RNA 6000 Nano Labchips according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Agilent Technologies Ireland, Dublin, Ireland). High-quality RNA (RNA integrity number\u2009>\u20097.2) was processed using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s procedures. The final individual RNA-Seq libraries were constructed using the Illumina Hiseq2000 platform, which created 100\u2009bp/paired-end (PE) sequence reads.Quality of the RNA sequence data was evaluated with FastQC v0.11.3 [47]. Low quality bases and adaptor sequences were removed with Trimmomatic v0.33 [48]. Reads were mapped to the reference genome (Bos taurus Ensembl UMD3.1) using Bowtie2 v2.2.6 [49]. Reads that mapped to multiple sites, single reads and unmapped reads were excluded from the analysis. Downstream analyses were performed with the statistical programming language R [50] and various R packages. GenomicFeatures v1.22.13 [51] and GenomicAlignments v1.6.3 [51] were used to annotate and count the reads. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was used to evaluate the clustering of the samples (time points and muscle types). edgeR 3.12.0 [52] was used for the analysis of differentially expressed (DE) genes by fitting a generalized linear model with a negative binomial distribution to model the data effects for time and tissue. RNA composition was normalized with the scaling factors from the trimmed means of the M-values using edgeR. Gene expression differences between muscles (LD vs SM) at each timepoint were evaluated as well as the changes in expression over time for each muscle in relation to day 0. Genes were considered as differentially expressed for a log fold change \u22652 (or\u2009\u2264\u20092, depending on the order of the contrast) [52] and a false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p-value <\u20090.05. The differentially expressed genes found in the study were tested with ClusterProfiler v2.5.5 [53] for Gene Ontology (GO) and Pathway enrichment analyses. This R package uses data from the Gene Ontology and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) databases to test for over-representation of DE genes in ontologies and pathways. For both analyses we considered terms and pathways as significant for a cutoff q-value <\u20090.05 to reduce false discovery rates due to multiple testing. The DE genes in the overrepresented terms had their expression across time (fold change ratio relative to day 0) graphed to evaluate the dynamics of expression changes from day 0 to 14. We also used VennDiagram v1.6.18 [54] to visualize overlap of differentially expressed genes across time points for each muscle. The background set of genes for both enrichment analyses consisted of the bovine genes expressed in this study after quality control.From the list of differentially expressed genes, eight were randomly selected for validation using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Expression of the MRF genes was also measured with qPCR due to their known role in myogenic processes. Total RNA was isolated from LD and SM muscle satellite cell cultures at six time points (days 0, 1, 2, 4, 7 and 14) from three independent biological replicates. Reverse transcription to cDNA was performed using the commercial kit SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis Supermix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The primer sequences are listed in Table 2.The measurement of the relative quantity of the cDNA of interest was performed using TAMRA PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) with the appropriate forward and reverse primers and 1\u2009\u03bcL of the cDNA mixture. We used the Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) with the thermal cycling parameters recommended by the manufacturer (40\u2009cycles of 15\u2009s at 95\u2009\u00b0C and 1\u2009min at 60\u2009\u00b0C). Relative expression was quantified with the 2-\u0394\u0394Ct method [55]. All sample values were normalized against the ribosomal protein S9 (RPS9) gene and expressed in arbitrary units. Titration of MRF mRNA primers against increasing amounts of cDNA gave linear responses with slopes between \u2212\u20092.8 and\u2009\u2212\u20093.0. To reduce the effect of assay-to-assay variation in the PCR assay, all values were calculated relative to a calibration standard run on every real-time PCR assay.Biological processCellular componentsCopies per MillionDifferentially expressed\nLongissimus dorsi\nMolecular functionMyogenic regulatory factorsMuscle satellite cells\nSemimembranosus\nThis work was carried out with the support of the Cooperative Research Program for Agriculture Science & Technology Development (Project No. PJ01091002 and PJ01361501) Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea.

The MSC were then treated with the differentiation medium and this timepoint was taken as day 0 (Fig.\u00a01). Differentiation of bovine myoblasts began between 2 and 4\u2009days later. LD formed multinucleated myotubes with significantly higher differentiation indexes compared to SM at days 3, 4 and 7 (Fig.\u00a02) which suggests a faster differentiation process in LD myoblasts. This faster differentiation in LD also hints at a faster proliferation rate in comparison to SM, however it was not measured in this study. On day 7, the myotubes of both muscles went through significant morphological changes by fusing to form mature multinucleated myotubes. There was also a significant reduction in the area occupied by the myotubes on day 7 in comparison to day 4 (Fig. 2). The differentiation indexes were calculated just for days 3, 4 and 7 since no myotubes were detected on day 2 (Fig. 2).\n\nFig. 1\nPhase contrast and immunohistochemistry of MSC during differentiation in bovine LD and SM tissues on days 0, 1, 4 and 7\n\n\nFig. 2\nDifferentiation indexes (area occupied by myotubes) on days 3, 4 and 7 in SM and LD\nTo characterize the gene expression profile during muscle differentiation, mRNA libraries were constructed at different stages of differentiation for LD and SM muscles. On average 80% of the paired reads mapped the B. taurus reference genome UMD3.1, from a mean value of 35,727,746 total reads per sample (Table 1 and additional details of the processed reads in Additional\u00a0file\u00a01). The principal components analysis of the gene expression showed that the differentiation stage was the primary source of variation and accounted for 81% of the variation; the differences in expression between the two muscle types explained a relatively small proportion of the variance (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02).Table 1\nSummary of RNA-seq reads\n\nThe values presented are the average of the three biological replicates for each muscle and time point\nThe stages of MSC differentiation observed in the histology aligned well with the qPCR time course expression of the Myogenic Regulatory Factors (MRF), PAX3 (paired box\u00a03) and IGF1 (Insulin-like growth factor 1) in both muscles (Fig.\u00a03). In LD, the expression of MYF5 \u2013 Myogenic Factor 5 (Fig. 3) rapidly increased on day 2, with a subsequent reduction in mRNA abundance from day 4 until day 14. This would be expected during the differentiation stage in which the myotubes were more abundant (Fig. 1). The expression in SM was relatively constant.\n\nFig. 3\nExpression of Myogenic Regulatory Factors and transcription factors in LD (blue lines) and SM (red lines) detected by qPCR. Error bars show standard errors of the mean of three biological replicates for three technical replicates\nThe number of differentially expressed genes across time was unsurprisingly large (Fig.\u00a04). In relation to the baseline day 0, there were 631, 155, 175, 519 and 586 DE genes in LD, while in SM we found 204, 0, 615, 761 and 1154 DE genes at days 1, 2, 4, 7 and 14 respectively (the complete list of DE genes is provided in Additional\u00a0file\u00a03).\n\nFig. 4\nVenn diagram with the number of common DE genes (FDR\u2009<\u20090.05, abs(log2FC) \u22652) between contrast of each timepoint vs day 0 for LD and SM muscles\nAcross all time points there were 13 genes differentially expressed between LD and SM (Additional file 3). The expression of the homeobox genes B2 (HOXB2), B4 (HOXB), B9 (HOXB9) and C8 (HOXC8), alongside forkhead box D1 (FOXD1), immunoglobulin-like and fibronectin type III domain containing 1 (IGFN), zinc finger members 2 (ZIC2) and 4 (ZIC4) were more abundant in LD, while the homeobox genes A11 (HOXA11) and C11 (HOXC11) plus paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 1 (PITX1), single-minded family bHLH transcription factor 2 (SIM2) and T-box\u00a04 (TBX4) were more expressed in SM (Fig.\u00a05 and Additional\u00a0file\u00a04). The consistent pattern of expression of these genes suggest that they could be involved in muscle fate differentiation into trunk or limb in cattle. Eight of these DE genes were randomly chosen for qPCR validation (Table 2). Significant differences in the relative expression levels were observed between muscles (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) confirming the results from the RNA-seq analysis.\n\nFig. 5\nExpression profile of DE genes comparing RNA-seq (solid bars) and qPCR (checkered bars) results during differentiation of satellite cells from LD (blue bars) and SM (red bars) muscles. The R2 Pearson correlation is shown for each gene\nTable 2\nList of qPCR primers used to validate the expression results from the RNA-seq analysis\nThe DE genes resulting from the time course analysis were used for a Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis. Enriched GO terms (Table 3) for Cellular components included extracellular space, contractile fiber, myofibril, sarcomere, actin cytoskeleton and cytoskeletal part. For Biological processes, some of the enriched terms were cell cycle, cell proliferation, cytoskeleton organization and muscle structure development. Calcium ion binding, receptor activity and cytoskeletal protein binding were enriched terms in the Molecular functions domain. The full list of enriched ontology terms is presented in the supplementary material (Additional\u00a0file\u00a05).Table 3\nGene Ontology of the differentially expressed genes in LD and SM muscles for days 1, 7 and 14 in relation to day 0. MF: molecular function; CC: cellular components; BP: biological process. Number of DE genes that are up-regulated (\u2191) and down-regulated (\u2193)\nAt the beginning of the differentiation (day 1) most genes involved in any enriched GO term were down regulated in both muscles, which is consistent with the morphological changes observed in the histology. However, due to the structural changes observed when myoblasts differentiated into myotubes (days 7 and 14 in Fig. 1), more genes, especially those involved in cellular component terms like microtubule and sarcomere were up regulated (days 7 and 14, Table 3). The down regulation of genes involved in cell cycle, G2/M transition of mitotic cell cycle and cell proliferation in differentially expressed genes from days 7 and 14 corresponds to the shift from proliferation to differentiation that was observed in the cultures (Fig. 1). The proportion of DE genes changed mainly due to the advancement of differentiation. To get a better understanding of the shift from proliferation to differentiation, we plotted the log2-fold change of the genes involved in the term G2/M transition of mitotic cell cycle (Fig.\u00a06). These genes were slightly upregulated at day 1 with a subsequent drop in abundance until day 4 and then low expression levels were maintained until day 14 in both muscles.\n\nFig. 6\nDifferentially expressed genes involved in the GO term G2/M transition of mitotic cell cycle for a) LD and b) SM\nWe used an ANOVA analysis to test the effects of tissue, time and the tissue by time interaction.

Main effects and interaction means were separated (P\u2009<\u20090.05) with the LSMEANS procedure of SAS. P-values came from the ANOVA analysis of the linear model:where treatment indicates time series for days 0, 1, 2, 4, 7 and 14 (6 levels) and tissue is LD and SM (2 levels).\n\nAdditional file 1:\nTable S1.

Historically, gene targeting was first done in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from the 129 family of inbred strains, leading to a mixed background or congenic mice when crossed with C57BL/6 mice. Depending on the number of backcrosses and breeding strategies, genomic segments from 129-derived ESCs can be introgressed into the C57BL/6 genome, establishing a unique genetic makeup that needs characterization in order to obtain valid conclusions from experiments using GEM lines. Currently, SNP genotyping is used to detect the extent of 129-derived ESC genome introgression into C57BL/6 recipients; however, it fails to detect novel/rare variants.Here, we present a computational pipeline implemented in the Galaxy platform and in BASH/R script to determine genetic introgression of GEM using next generation sequencing data (NGS), such as whole genome sequencing (WGS), whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA-Seq. The pipeline includes strategies to uncover variants linked to a targeted locus, genome-wide variant visualization, and the identification of potential modifier genes. Although these methods apply to congenic mice, they can also be used to describe variants fixed by genetic drift. As a proof of principle, we analyzed publicly available RNA-Seq data from five congenic knockout (KO) lines and our own RNA-Seq data from the Sall2 KO line. Additionally, we performed target validation using several genetics approaches.We revealed the impact of the 129-derived ESC genome introgression on gene expression, predicted potential modifier genes, and identified potential phenotypic interference in KO lines. Our results demonstrate that our new approach is an effective method to determine genetic introgression of GEM.The use of mouse models has resulted in a wealth of knowledge regarding gene function in animal and human diseases, including complex traits. The modern laboratory mouse is the result of careful breeding and trait selection that began in the early twentieth century [1\u20133]. Inbred mice, produced by brother-sister mating, are isogenic and homozygous, making it possible to know the genetic profile of the strain by typing an individual [4]. Some inbred strains have features that are valuable for transgenic [5] and embryonic stem cell (ESC) technology [6]. The 129-derived ESCs are particularly successful in germline transmission and have been extensively used in the creation of over 5000 knockout (KO) lines [6\u20138]. However, many ESC lines have been now derived from other strains. For example, ESCs from C57BL/6\u2009N are used in large consortium projects (e.g., EUCOMM). After screening for an ESC clone harboring the targeted allele (e.g., KO and knockin [KI]), ESCs are typically injected into blastocysts (from a strain that differs in coat color) in order to obtain chimeras showing a mixture of black and agouti (or albino) spots, suitable to estimate the degree of chimerism. These chimeras need to be crossed with wild-type (WT) mice to test for germline transmission. The heterozygous carriers of targeted alleles are then either intercrossed, obtaining a line with mixed background, or backcrossed (typically to recipient C57BL/6), obtaining a congenic line by further backcrossing [4, 9]. However, this strategy has disadvantages; the resulting mice will contain mixed backgrounds, and the development of a full congenic line could take up to 5\u2009years given that 10 generations of backcrosses are needed with the recipient strain [10]. Although this timeframe can be reduced when using marker-assisted backcrossing (speed congenics), it could still take at least 2.5\u2009years [11].An important consideration is the complex phenotypic evaluation that could result from targeted gene analysis in mixed background lines. Each individual KO or KI mouse (and the wild-type [WT] littermates) will have a different genetic background compositions, due to differences in the segregating background genes from the two parental strains [12, 13]. Thus, the different genetic backgrounds of KO/KI models could influence the resulting targeted-gene phenotype [14\u201318], particularly affecting the reproducibility of translational studies when mixed and/or uncharacterized backgrounds are used [19\u201321]. Additionally, the presence of a segment of the ESC-derived chromosome flanking the targeted gene also known as the \u201ccongenic footprint\u201d, can confound analysis of phenotypes associated with the targeted gene [22]. The congenic footprint and its pattern of expression could lead to an inaccurate comparison between WT and KO/KI mice due to the linkage of genes at the targeted locus [23]. In line with this, several reports have shown evidence of dramatic changes in gene expression associated with flanking genes, closely related to the genetic background [22, 24\u201326]. These interactions could incorporate bias in dissecting the KO/KI-dependent transcriptomes, adjudicating erroneous phenotypes [23, 27\u201329]. Incorporation of new genome editing nuclease-dependent techniques is certainly addressing this problem, allowing the generation of GEM on any inbred strain without using ESCs or chimeras. Still, novel variants could be fixed in these lines due to off-target effects from the Cas9 model generation [30] and/or genetic drift over time [31], justifying the need for accurate genetic background characterization in every GEM line used. Although background characterization can be performed using SNP genotyping in different platforms [32], these methods test a limited number of loci, not always related to protein coding genes, and do not detect novel variants.Next generation sequencing (NGS) enables high throughput sequencing of genes and genomes at relatively low cost. However, resulting NGS data is very complex, and additional computational methods should be available for the scientific community to characterize the genetic background of GEM lines. Here, we present a computational pipeline that uses NGS data from whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS), whole exome sequencing (WES) and/or RNA-Seq to detect the nature, ploidy and amount of introgressed variants in GEM lines. This pipeline can generate genome-wide plots of variants per genotype, detect congenic footprints and identify potential modifier genes, which will enable a better understanding of the phenotypic outcomes in studies using partially congenic or mixed background GEM lines, as well as to unravel novel genetic interactions in these models.We obtained Sall2 KO mice from Dr. Ryuichi Nishinakamura (Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan) by a material transfer agreement (MTA, 2010). Genotyping of these mice was as previously described [33] and their housing was performed according to the Animal Ethics Committee of the Chile\u2019s National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT, Protocol FONDECYT project 1,151,031). At 13,5\u2009days post coitum female mice were euthanized with a CO2 inhalation process, and MEFs from Sall2 WT and KO embryos were isolated as described previously [33]. Mice were routinely genotyped by isolating tail DNA as previously reported [33]. In brief, 1\u2009\u03bcL of genomic DNA was used for PCR analysis using the following oligonucleotides: forward, 5\u2032-CACATTTCGTGGGCTACAAG-3\u2032; reverse, 5\u2032-CTCAGAGCTGTTTTCCTGGG-3\u2032; and Neo, 5\u2032-GCGTTGGCTACCCGTGATAT-3\u2032. The sizes of the PCR products were 188\u2009bp for the WT and 380\u2009bp for the KO.Sall2+/+, Sall2+/\u2212, and Sall2\u2212/\u2212 primary and immortalized MEFs were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, GE Healthcare HyClone), 1% glutamine (Invitrogen), and 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Experiments with primary Sall2+/+ and Sall2\u2212/\u2212 MEFs were performed with early passages (passages 3\u20134). Immortalized Sall2+/+ and Sall2\u2212/\u2212 MEFs were obtained using SV40 large T antigen based on a modified protocol from Zhu et al. [34]. For transfection of primary MEFs, we used Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and 2\u2009\u03bcg of SV40 large T antigen expression vector (Addgene Plasmid #9053). After cell transfection, we proceeded to select for low density. To complete the immortalization process, 5\u20136 post-transfection passages were carried out. Human embryonic kidney epithelial cells (HEK293; American Type Culture Collection CRL-1573\u2122) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% glutamine, and 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin.We purified RNA (Qiagen) from Sall2+/+, Sall2+/\u2212 and Sall2\u2212/\u2212 MEFs treated or not with doxorubicin 1\u2009\u03bcM (Sigma Aldrich) for 16\u2009h. RNA-Seq libraries were prepared at the University of Cambridge sequencing facility (UK). Sequencing in a Next-seq 500 machine yielded an output of 400 gigabases and four FASTQ files per sample. We merged the FASTQ files matching each sample and aligned the reads against the mouse genome assembly (mm10 build) using the HISAT2 aligner (v2.0.5.1, default settings) [35]. We sorted the BAM files using the SortSam.jar script from Picard tools and implemented the HTSeq code (union mode) to quantify the number of reads per gene in each BAM file [36]. The GTF file (genes.gtf) used in HTSeq was from the igenomes repository (mm10, Illumina). Prior to testing for differential expression, we normalized the count table with the RUVSeq package available in Bioconductor (R, Bioconductor: https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RUVSeq.html) with in-silico empirical negative controls and RUVg normalization [37]. The edgeRun code (exact test, y\u2009=\u200950,000) was used to perform differential expression analysis between WT and KO samples [38]. We selected further DEGs with an FDR\u2009<\u20090.001. Gene ontology analysis was performed by using the InnateDB database (https://www.innatedb.com) [39].We uploaded individual BAM files from the RNA-Seq data to the main Galaxy platform (https://usegalaxy.org/). After sorting, genome-wide simple diploid calling was applied using Freebayes (https://github.com/ekg/freebayes). We filtered variants from the resulting raw VCF (Variant Call Format) files using the VCFlib program (https://github.com/vcflib/vcflib) with the following criteria: -f \u201cDP > 10\u201d (Depth over 10 reads) and -f \u201cQUAL > 30\u201d (minimum Phred-scaled probability of error over 30). Chromosomal histograms were plotted using an \u201cin-house\u201d R script (see \u201cscript outline\u201d in https://github.com/cfarkas/Genotype-variants). For identification of common variants in KO animals not present in their WT counterparts, we used several tools from the VCFlib toolkit available in Galaxy. We started intersecting KO VCF files using the VCF-VCF intersect program (reference genome mm10) and annotated genotypes (VCF annotate genotypes) using calls from the WT file. We filtered the resulting annotated VCF file by selecting lines that did not match those of the WT (Filter and Sort). An output file with the KO-linked variants was obtained.Four BASH scripts were used sequentially to 1) sort bam files with SAMtools (sort_bam.sh), 2) perform variant calling with Freebayes (variant_collection.sh, parameters described above), 3) filter variants in each VCF file with VCFlib/Bcftools dependencies (filtering_combined_mouse.sh, parameters for VCFlib described above) and 4) dissect KO/KI-linked variants and visualize common variants for each genotype with R (genotype_variants_mouse.sh, see \nhttps://github.com/cfarkas/Genotype-variants\n).We developed a script written in R (genotype_variants.R) for proper visualization of variants across mouse chromosomes. The script takes the intersected VCF files from WT and KO mice in VCF format as inputs and produces an output of variant frequency per chromosome. The script also includes statistical detection of chromosomes with KO-linked variants in the experiments. We tested the frequency distribution of variants with the Cochran-Armitage test for trend distribution, available in the DescTools package implemented in the R statistical program (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DescTools/index.html). Detected variants were binned every 10 million base pairs according to their chromosomal coordinates, ordered in a contingency table and plotted. After this, a Cochran-Armitage test for trend distribution was implemented to identify chromosomes containing KO-linked variants, based on the frequency distribution of WT and KO genotypes. Graphics were done with the ggplot2 package, implemented in R (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html).We isolated RNA from cells using TRIzol (ThermoFisher Scientific, Inc.) followed by chloroform and isopropanol extraction. The RNA samples were treated with Turbo DNA-free Kit (Invitrogen) to eliminate any residual DNA from the preparation. Total RNA (2\u2009\u03bcg) was reverse transcribed using the M-MLV reverse transcriptase (PROMEGA) and 0.25\u2009\u03bcg of Anchored Oligo(dT)20 Primer (Invitrogen; 12,577\u2013011). We performed qPCR reactions in triplicate using KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Master Mix (2X) Kit (Kapa Biosciences) and primer concentrations of 0.4\u2009\u03bcM (Additional file 10: Table S1). Cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95\u2009\u00b0C for 3\u2009min, then 40\u2009cycles with 95\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009s (denaturation) and 60\u2009\u00b0C for 20\u2009s (annealing/extension). To control specificity of the amplified product, a melting-curve analysis was carried out. No amplification of unspecific product was observed. Expression of each gene was relative to Polr2a gene (RNA pol II) and plotted as fold change compared to control in each case.Proteins from cell lysates (50\u201380\u2009\u03bcg of total protein) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred for 1\u2009h at 200\u2009mA to PVDF membranes (Immobilon; Millipore) using a wet transfer system. The PVDF membranes were blocked for 1\u2009h at room temperature in 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T (TBS with 0.1% Tween), and incubated with primary antibody at an appropriate dilution at 4\u2009\u00b0C overnight in blocking buffer. After washing, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in TBS-T buffer for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Immunolabeled proteins were visualized by ECL (General Electric Healthcare, Amersham, UK). Antibodies used for Western blotting were as follows: anti-angiogenin (1:500, ab10600; Abcam), anti-p53 (1:500, PAb240; Abcam), anti-p21 (1:500, sc-6246; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-\u03b2-actin (1:10000, C4; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-SALL2 (1:1000, HPA004162; SIGMA).For transient transfection, 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 immortalized MEFs (iMEFs) from Sall2+/+ mice were electroporated using 30\u2009\u03bcg of plasmids at 1150\u2009V for 30 milliseconds (NEON Transfection System, Thermo Fisher Scientific). For transduction of Sall2 shRNA into iMEFs, lentiviral particles were packaged in HEK293 cells by co-transfecting pCMV-dR8.2 dvpr (Addgene Plasmid #8455), pCMV-VSVG (Addgene plasmid #8454) and pLKO.1 (Addgene Plasmid #8453) containing the 5\u2019-CCGGAAGTCATGGATACAGAAGCACACTCGAGTGTGCTCTGTATCCATGACTTTTTTTG -3\u2032 (loop & stop in bold) sequence, which targets exon 2 of Sall2. The medium was changed every 24\u2009h with 9\u2009\u03bcg/mL of polybrene and 24, 48 and 72-h supernatants were filtered through a 0.45\u2009\u03bcm filter, collected and added to WT iMEF cells in each case. iMEF cells were selected with 5\u2009\u03bcg/mL of puromycin and further recovered with fresh DMEM medium.WT iMEFs were electroporated as described above, with vectors encoding CRISPR-Cas9 in frame with PaprikaRFP (ATUM, DNA TWOPOINTO INC) using the following guide RNA sequences: GGTGAGCGAGGAATTCGGTC and TAGTCTAGGTGCTCCGGTAC targeting the largest exon of the mouse Sall2 gene (exon 2). These two proteins can be efficiently produced from one coded peptide that relies on the self-cleaving 2A peptide to allow translational skipping [40]. At 16\u2009h following electroporation, the top 2% of the brightest cells were sorted with BDFACSAria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences-US), and pools of 100 cells were plated. The pools were grown for two weeks, and Western blotting against SALL2 was performed to identify silenced cells. Genomic PCR and further sequence analysis were used to confirm CRISPR-Cas9-mediated edition of the Sall2 locus.Since the 129P2 inbred strain (used for Sall2 gene targeting) was already characterized in the Mouse Genome Project (Wellcome Sanger Institute, UK) [46, 47], we next applied the pipeline to identify 129-derived variants from the Sall2 KO sequencing experiment. We plotted variants from each genotype according to genomic coordinates using our script written in R (genotype_variants.R, Fig. 2d). Variants were binned every 10 million base pairs (Mb) from each genotype and plotted by chromosome. In the case of Sall2 KO, the distribution of KO common variants was similar to the distribution of WT variants, with the exception of Chr 14, where the Sall2 gene targeting was done (located at 52.3\u2009Mb) (Fig. 2d). We also investigated the distribution of all variants (subtracting C57BL/6J variants) in each KO line analyzed and applied the Cochran-Armitage test for trend distribution to find chromosomes presenting differential distribution of variants. According to the analysis, the Gtf2ird1 KO line displayed extensive backcrossing with C57BL/6J and shows a congenic footprint on Chr 5 where the Gtf2ird1 gene is located (P\u2009<\u20090.0001, Cochran-Armitage test for trend distribution) (Additional file 2). The Mecp2 KO also presented extensive backcrossing with C57BL/6J mice, but not an obvious footprint on Chr X where the Mecp2 gene is located (P\u2009=\u20090.4508) (Additional file 2). Still, variants linked to the targeted gene were expected due to the congenic nature of this KO line.Similar to the Gtf2ird1 KO, the Stc1 KO line presented extensive backcrossing with C57BL/6J and a clear footprint on Chr 14 where Stc1 is located (P\u2009<\u20090.0001) (Additional file 2). The Itch KO also presented extensive backcrossing with C57BL/6J mice; however, four chromosomes display obvious targeted locus-linked variants (Chr 2, Chr 9, Chr 10 and Chr 16 with P\u2009<\u20090.0001 for the first three and P\u2009<\u20090.02 for the last) (see Additional file 2).The Sall2 KO presented very similar distribution as shown in Fig. 2d, suggesting that most of the variants in this line come from 129P2-derived ESCs (Additional file 2). Thus, the mixed background with the ESCs was obvious in this KO due to the amount of 129P2 introgressed variants along ten chromosomes, including Chr 14 where Sall2 and the footprint are located. Five chromosomes presented differential distribution of variants, with Chr 14 showing the lowest p-value (Additional file 4: Table S1 ). Similar to the Sall2 KO, the Hnrnpd KO displayed a mixed background, but the average distribution of the variants greatly differed between genotypes (Additional file 2). Although a footprint was present on Chr 5 where Hnrnpd is located, the variant distribution was significantly different in 12 other chromosomes (Additional file 4: Table S1 ), likely due to a low number of backcrosses with C57BL/6J. Thus, we expected potentially disturbing passenger mutations from 129S6-derived ESCs (W4) in the Hnrnpd KO line [48]. We also reviewed Casp4 variants on Chr 9, a gene naturally inactivated (5 base pair deletion) in several 129 strains (S1, S2, S6, P2, X1) [49]. Variant calling from every biological replicate of this study revealed the genotype of 129 congenic Casp4 across samples, evidencing ploidy of Casp4 129-derived variants in one WT and in two Hnrnpd-KO samples (Additional file 4: Table S2). We confirmed this observation by the lack of expression of Casp4 exon 7, as described for several 129 strains [50] (Fig. 2e). Thus, besides variants that are linked to the targeted locus, mixed backgrounds in KO lines could have a deep influence on gene expression or phenotypes, as reviewed previously [10, 51, 52].In addition to the RNA-seq data, we also tested our pipeline using WES data from the GEO dataset, GSE115017, and single cell WGS from the ArrayExpress archive, E-MTAB-4183. We successfully detected the introgressed variants from DBA/2 mice in the C57BL/6J-DBA/2 sample from the GSE115017 study, and mixed background samples from the E-MTAB-4183 study, depicting the number of chromosomes with ESC introgression, respectively (Additional file 3). Taken together, our procedures can offer a reliable way to detect genetic variation from NGS data, effectively identifying genetic introgression.In the case of the Stc1 KO, nearly half of the variants were heterozygous; thus, the ploidy of this footprint has heterozygous and homozygous distribution (Fig. 4f). Reviewing the distribution of homozygous and heterozygous variants for every littermate showed that the KO1 embryo displayed homozygous variants in both homozygous and heterozygous portions of the footprint, while KO2 and KO3 embryos only displayed these variants at the homozygous portion (Fig. 4g). Conversely, KO2 and KO3 embryos displayed heterozygous variants, while KO1 barely has these types of variants (Fig. 4h). Thus, the KO1 embryo is homozygous for both portions of the footprint while KO2 and KO3 are not. Figure 4i shows a summary of the ploidy in every littermate for the Stc1 KO line, evidencing ploidy variability in the footprint region. All these analyses suggest that the inheritance of the congenic footprint is complex and cannot be assumed as homozygous in every case.To confirm Sall2-dependent DEGs in another genetic background, we also used data from a microarray study of transcription factor (TF)-inducible mouse ESCs in which a single TF (such as Sall2) is induced in a doxycycline-controllable manner [55], which allowed cross-validation of 37 other DEGs from the RNA-Seq experiment (Additional file 7: Table S3). From this comparison, 15 DEGs presented similar fold changes between studies (Fig. 5f). We evaluated two of these DEGs by qPCR, confirming trends from the RNA-Seq and the microarray studies (Fig. 5g). These 15 DEGs partly confirmed the initial gene ontology terms (Additional file 7: Table S4). Additionally, we cross-validated the Sall2-dependent downregulation of Ang, Pnp, and Rpph1 using a CRISPR model of SALL2 in HEK293 cells, lacking the highest expressed isoform of Sall2 (Fig. 5h). Our study confirmed that the congenic footprint and its interaction with the genetic background influence transcriptome analysis from KO lines. Thus, additional experimental approaches and cross validation are required to determine gene-dependent targets.We also analyzed gene expression using doxorubicin as an environmental perturbation, since this drug increases nucleosome turnover around the promoters of active genes [58]. We tested 16 congenic DEGs ranked by fold change for genotype dependency in the control condition, of which eight display linear genetic dependency (Fig. 6b, left). Global perturbation with doxorubicin altered fold changes of these genes and the DEGs with genetic dependence (Fig. 6b, right). Four of these genes displayed genetic dependence in both control and doxorubicin-treated conditions (Ang, Tmem260, 4930579G18Rik and Osgep, see red dots in Fig. 6b), and Ang was one of the most differentially expressed genes in both cases (Additional file 7: Table S1 and Additional file 8: Table S2, respectively). Sall2-KO Ang displayed low expression levels both in control and doxorubicin-treated MEFs compared to WT Ang expression. However, the fold change in Ang expression induced by doxorubicin was similar between genotypes (Fig. 6c). These results suggest that the congenic (129P2) Ang promoter, controlling both Ang and Rnase4 genes [59] is functional, but Ang transcription is low in the 129P2 strain. In agreement with our data, RNA-Seq data from the striatum of the eight Collaborative Cross founder strains [60] (SRA project ID: PRJNA228935) showed that Ang expression is remarkably low in six out of the eight strains (except C57BL/6J and CAST/EiJ), values corresponding to outliers in comparison to the group. We did not see this effect in the expression of Rnase4 (Fig. 6d). Moreover, strains with low levels of Ang in the striatum presented several variants in the Ang/Rnase4 gene, which were absent in the C57BL/6J and CAST/EiJ strains (Additional file 9A). These variants are also present in Sall2-KO MEFs, congenic from 129P2, but absent in the WT counterpart (Additional file 9B), suggesting an association of these variants with the low expression of congenic Ang. In line with this, Sashimi plots from the RNA-Seq data across mice founders supported by-pass of Ang transcription linked to the genomic variants (Fig. 6e and f, respectively and see Additional file 9C). Furthermore, an independent RNA-Seq study from the hippocampus of 129S1/SvImJ mice [61] (GEO DataSets accession GSE76567) showed strong downregulation of Ang transcripts compared to the C57BL/6J mice (Additional file 9D), a trend that we also experimentally confirmed in the cortex of the Sall2-KO mice by qPCR (Additional file 9E). By Western blot analysis, we confirmed strong downregulation of ANG protein levels in Sall2-KO MEFs (Fig. 6g), in agreement with the low Ang early detected by qPCR (See Ang in Fig. 5b). In contrast, mild downregulation of ANG protein levels was detected in Sall2-silenced cells (Fig. 6h) along with mild downregulation of Rnase4 (Fig. 6i). Similarly, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated Sall2KO in WT MEFs showed mild downregulation of Ang (Fig. 6j, see model validation in Additional file 11). These results suggest that SALL2 transcriptionally regulates Ang/Rnase4, but Ang expression is additionally affected by congenic variants present in the Sall2 KO line. Consistent with transcriptional regulation by Sall2, the Ang/Rnase4 promoter contains a cluster of three SALL2 binding sites around the transcription start site (data not shown). An Ang/Rnase4 promoter of 1231 base pairs displayed less activation in Sall2-KO versus WT cells, consistent with the mild downregulation of Ang and ANG protein levels in Sall2-silenced cells (Fig. 6k). Taken together, congenic Ang is transcribed at low levels due to genetic determinants inherited from 129P2, somehow masking Sall2-dependent transcriptional regulation. Thus, Ang could be classified as a potential modifier gene in Sall2-KO MEFs.The origin of the ESCs used in gene targeting, the number of backcrosses and consecutive breeding used for the maintenance of GEM (KO/KI) lines (including potential genetic drift) all can have a profound impact in the genetic make-up of these models. These genetic variations within mice from the same KO or KI line will influence gene expression and phenotypes, potentially jeopardizing experimental conclusions. Thus, the genetic background of GEM mice imposes biases that need to be addressed before making conclusions to ensure reproducibility of gene expression and the phenotypes associated to a targeted gene.We designed an automatized pipeline implemented in both the Galaxy platform and in a BASH/R script to perform genetic background characterization of GEM lines. Using NGS data, our pipeline can 1) identify introgression of ESC-derived variants in the C57BL/6 background and other recipient genomes, including genome-wide variant visualization; 2) define partial congenic, fully congenic, or mixed backgrounds and 3) detect and characterize the ploidy of the congenic footprint. After applying the pipeline, the Ensembl variant predictor algorithm [44] can be used to classify variants as novel or existent. However, a potential limitation of our pipeline in Galaxy, using WGS data (at high depth) is the amount of computational time employed in the variant calling, making the use of public servers impractical and restricting the calculations to a cluster. To circumvent this problem, we implemented the pipeline purely in BASH, raising the open file limit for such analysis (see Github: https://github.com/cfarkas/Genotype-variants). Thus, our pipeline is flexible in the use of both RNA and DNA sequencing data. Large-scale genomic sequencing data is superior for measuring introgression of genes or genomic segments, from one strain to another, as well as for identifying sequence differences in non-transcribed DNA. However, using RNA seq data, it is possible to assess influences on gene expression caused by the congenic footprints and to identify putative modifier genes with an eQTL strategy. Of relevance, is that our approach provided the opportunity to uncover genetic contamination along with novel variants fixed by genetic drift.To explore the introgression of gene variants in GEM mice, we applied the pipeline using publicly available high throughput data, in addition to our experimental data from Sall2 KO mice. As a proof of concept, we were able to identify the ploidy of 129-derived variants that leads to a Casp4 null mutation (reported in several 129 strains) in the background of Hnrnpd KO mice. We also found that the number of novel variants is highly variable between KO lines, even overpassing ESC introgressed variants. This observation represents a bias since novel and missense variants correlate in number, imposing novel backgrounds for the KO lines and the need for proper characterization of these variants.Our studies indicate that the number of congenic genes varies between KO lines, and in one case introgressed genes are outside the targeted chromosome (e.g., for the Itch KO). The latter example implies that both genotypes (WT/KO) were independently maintained. Alternatively, we may have detected a partially (incomplete) congenic strain with residual segments outside the targeted chromosome. After obtaining linked variants by the WT subtraction, we suggest DNA sequencing of cells or tissues from heterozygous littermates, as it will further confirm the extension of the footprint. Since most of the variants near the target gene are homozygous, calls from a heterozygous genotype can discriminate these variants assuming Mendelian inheritance. This method was successful in the Sall2 KO, as evidenced by the >\u200960\u2009Mb footprint. Nevertheless, a more complex scenario of ploidy can be found, as it is the case of the Stc1 KO where nearly half of the footprint is heterozygous and introgressed with different ploidy among KO littermates. We recognized that this issue is concerning in terms of reproducibility across biological replicates in KO studies.Using Sall2 KO as a model, it was possible to assess the influences on gene expression caused by the congenic footprint and to identify putative modifier genes (eQTLs) using RNA-Seq data. By silencing Sall2 (using shRNA, CRISPR-Cas9) within cells of same genetic background (WT littermate), we also demonstrated the importance of validation of target-dependent genes initially identified using the Sall2 WT/KO MEFs. Likely because of the influence of the introgressed 129P2 genome in Chr 14 of Sall2 KO cells, several DEGs found in WT/KO MEFs comparison could not be confirmed by Sall2 shRNA experiments. Interestingly, Pnp, a gene within the congenic region of Chr 14, was identified as a DEG in the Sall2-shRNA studies, but not in the analysis of the RNA-seq data from Sall2 WT/KO lines. Further analysis uncovered a bias caused by genetic variation in the KO model due to mismatches in the PCR primer hybridization region (Fig. 5e). The congenic nature of Pnp likely explains the failure to detect it as a DEG in the Sall2 KO MEFs. In fact, polymorphisms in gene regulatory regions can modify their transcriptional output by creating or ablating transcription factor binding sites or other transcriptional regulatory elements [25].Using several experimental approaches, we found that the low transcription of Ang in Sall2 KO MEFs is likely caused by genetic components inherited from the targeted ESCs, but also by the absence of functional SALL2 transcription factor. Our experimental data also suggest that congenic Ang is a modifier gene, which show effects on genes related to the targeted gene, specifically affecting SALL2-target Cdkn1a (p21) expression. However, we cannot discount the idea that the levels of Cdkn1a in the Sall2 KO could be consequence of a polygenic effect and not only due to low levels of ANG.In summary, due to the mentioned constraints in the use of KO/KI congenic mice, conclusions related to gene expression and phenotypes could be misleading. Selection of an appropriate strain and characterization of the genetic background are critical aspects of any experiment using GEM lines. Even for technical reasons, polymorphisms in coding genes should be detected for adequate primer design if qPCR validation is intended. In silico characterization of variants coming from the genetic background, including the dissection of congenic variants, can improve our understanding of phenotypic outcomes in GEM lines. However, validation of data using alternative approaches (e.g., shRNA, siRNA, and CRISPR-Cas9 targeting) is also required for specific target-dependent conclusions. We suggest generating KOs by genome editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9, in order to assign gene expression and phenotypes solely due to the targeted gene. Nevertheless, genetic characterization is also needed due to the occurrence of off-target mutations or genetic drift. Our strategy can refine the use of KO lines and open opportunities to uncover new genetic interactions, such as the Ang/Cdkn1a axis described here.We present a computational pipeline implemented in the Galaxy platform and in BASH/R script to determine genetic introgression of GEM models using NGS data. The pipeline allows identification of congenic strains, ploidy nature of variants and the estimation of the backcrossing state in the models in use as well as visual assessment of congenic regions in the mouse genome. In addition, it allows identification of putative modifier genes. We suggest that our strategy together with target validation experiments refines the use of KO/KI lines and opens opportunities to uncover new genetic interactions that could impact phenotypic outcomes.129P2OlaHsd mouse strainAngiogeninClustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeatsDeoxyribonucleic AcidExpression QTLEmbryonic stem cellGenetically engineered miceGene Expression OmnibusImmortalized MEFsInsertion/deletion polymorphismKnock-inKnockoutMouse embryonic fibroblastsMouse Genomes ProjectNext Generation Sequencingp21Cip1/Waf1Polymerase chain reactionQuantitative real-time PCRQuantitative trait lociRNA-sequencingShort hairpin ribonucleic acidSingle nucleotide polymorphismSequence Read ArchiveTumor Protein p53 (mouse)University of California Santa CruzVariant Call FormatVariant effect predictorWhole Exome SequencingWhole Genome SequencingThis work was supported by a Regular Fondecyt Grant (#1151031) to RP, Regular Fondecyt Grant (#1160731) to AC, Fondecyt PhD Scholarship 2013\u20132017 to CF, and P30 CA016672 DHHS/NCI Cancer Center Support Grant to MD Anderson Cancer Center to FB.Genotype-Variants pipeline is available on Github at https://github.com/cfarkas/Genotype-variants.

The pipeline can be implemented both in the Galaxy platform [41, 42] and directly in BASH using several scripts (See METHODS section). If the VCF file of the ESC is available, the pipeline can also identify ESC-introgressed variants (Fig. 1).\n\nFig. 1\nA computational pipeline for the detection of ESC-derived introgressed variants. Galaxy Platform: The pipeline starts with the input of the aligned BAM file from each genotype on the corresponding mouse genome build (e.g., HISAT2 output on the mm10 genome build for RNA-Seq data, BWA output from WES or WGS). The Freebayes variant caller program (simple variant calling) produces a VCF file from every BAM file. We filtered these VCF files using VCFlib, with the following parameters: -f \u201cQUAL > 30\u201d, \u2212f \u201cDP > 10\u201d. Next, VCF-VCF intersect program intersects VCF files from each genotype to obtain the average variation on each genotype (mm10 build, default parameters). If the genome of the ESC used for targeting is available, and variants are correctly characterized, we can use these calls to intersect ESC introgressed variants in the VCF files from each genotype. We used VCF files available in the mouse genome project (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/data/mouse-genomes-project) based on the GRCm38 mouse genome release, compatible with the mm10 build (release REL-1505-SNPs_Indels). In these VCF files, the prefix \u201cchr\u201d in every variant call line needs to be added for compatibility with Freebayes VCF files (see UNIX code). If the genome of the ESC is not available, novel and ESC-derived variants are obtained. To confirm chromosomes with a differential distribution of variants among genotypes, we applied the Cochran-Armitage test for trend distribution. BASH: Input BAM files from RNA-Seq/WES/WGS are sorted and indexed with the sort_bam.sh script, then, variant_collection.sh script is applied for variant collection in each BAM file with Freebayes. Filtering and intersection are proceeded as described in the Galaxy platform with the filtering_combined_mouse.sh script. At this step, intersection with ESC-derived variants from the mouse project can be applied to the intersected VCF files (see Github: https://github.com/cfarkas/Genotype-variants). Finally, genome-wide plots of the intersected variants per genotype including KO-linked variants can be obtained by applying the genotype_variants_mouse.sh script\nWe first tested the pipeline in silico using RNA-Seq data from five congenic KO lines publicly available in GEO datasets with the following accession numbers: GSE71126, GSE81082, GSE47395, GSE65686 and GSE83555 (Mepc2, Gtf2ird1, Stc1, Itch and Hnrnpd/AUF-1 targeted genes, respectively). In addition, we generated and analyzed our own RNA-Seq data from MEFs isolated from Sall2 WT and Sall2-knockout embryos (Sall2 KO). The Sall2 gene targeting was done in 129P2/OlaHsd (129P2)-derived ESCs (E14.1) [43]. The pipeline was applied to call novel and existing variants from each experiment. Further characterization of the variants was done with the variant effect predictor (VEP) algorithm [44]. Focusing on KO samples, we found that the number and ratio of novel/existing variants varied among the KO lines, and that novel variants accounted for more than 50% of the total variants, as seen in Mecp2 and Gtf2ird1 KOs (Fig. 2a). We also observed that the number of missense and frameshift variants were positively correlated with the number of novel variants (Fig. 2b) (P\u2009=\u20090.0167, Spearman\u2019s correlation). The ratio of homozygous/heterozygous variants among KO lines also varied, but homozygous variants predominated in each RNA-Seq experiment (Fig. 2c) as expected from inbred backgrounds [45].\n\nFig. 2\nGenome-wide detection and distribution of variants from GEM mice. a Interleaved bar graph showing the percentage of novel (black bars) and existing (grey bars) variants characterized by the variant effect predictor (VEP) in each KO. The total number of variants is depicted above each bar. b Percentage of frameshift variants (red), missense variants (green) and other variants (grey) characterized in every KO. c The ratio between homozygous (black) and heterozygous variants (grey) expressed as percentages in every KO. d Histogram of 129P2OlaHsd private variants per chromosome in Sall2 WT and null embryos. We binned the genomic coordinates of each chromosome every 10 million bases and plotted the variants of each genotype as frequency histograms according to these positions. Blue bars represent variants from one WT embryo and red bars represent the average variants from three Sall2-null embryos. e Sashimi plots from three biological replicates of WT and KO RNA sequencing samples from Hnrnpd KO. Per-base expression is plotted on the y-axis of Sashimi plot; genomic coordinates on the x-axis, and the gene structure are represented on the bottom (in blue, obtained from the USCS server). We obtained the genotypes of the Casp4 gene from each replicate with Freebayes based on at least one SNP call. We highlighted the expression of exon 7 in a black rectangle to denote its absence in Casp4 null samples\nSince the existence of variants linked to targeted loci leads to inaccurate comparisons between WT and KO mice, it is important to detect this bias. Our pipeline in the Galaxy platform (also automatized in the BASH pipeline) allows the analysis of variant distribution and extension, the so-called congenic footprint (Fig. 3a). For the analysis of introgressed variants, we input the intersected VCF files from WT and KO genotypes of Gtf2ird1, Mecp2, Stc1 and Itch congenic lines, in addition to the Sall2 KO (MEFs) and Hnrnpd/AUF-1 KO due to the presence of variants on Chr 14 and Chr 5, respectively. We initially performed genotype annotation on KO VCF files using WT VCF files and then selected variants in chromosomes with a significant difference in distribution detected using a Cochran-Armitage test. After selecting lines of KO-annotated VCF files that do not match genotypes, an output with KO-linked variants per chromosome was obtained. For the functional characterization, the variant predictor algorithm (VEP) was used to determine the effect of these variants, including the list of genes linked to the KO genotype (Fig. 3b). As expected, we detected a single chromosome with footprint variants in Gtf2ird1, Mecp2, Sall2 and Stc1 KO lines (Fig. 3c, d, e, and f, respectively) each one with a different number of variants (Additional file 5: Table S1-S4 ). The distributions of variants in the Sall2 and Stc1 KOs were similar because both genes are located on Chr 14 (Fig. 3e and f, respectively). Surprisingly, Itch KO displayed a footprint in four chromosomes, including Chr 2 where the gene targeting was done (Fig. 3g and Additional file 5: Table S5). We also noticed that variants outside of Chr 2 were heterozygous and could be inherited with the congenic footprinting. VEP annotation led to a diverse number of genes in each KO line (Additional file 5: Table 6). Additionally, the number of backcrossings in each model can be estimated using the formula cM\u2009=\u2009[200/N], where N is the generation number and cM the extension of the footprint in centimorgans [53, 54]. The extension of the footprint was estimated with the aid of the histograms in each KO line (denoted as red coordinates in Additional File 5), and homozygous coordinates were transformed to cM using the Mouse Map Converter application (http://cgd.jax.org/mousemapconverter/). Figure 3h depicts the number of backcrossings per KO line, indicating that Hnrnpd/AUF-1 KO had the lowest number of backcrosses (5) and the largest footprint (42.14\u2009cM), consistent with a mixed background. Conversely, Itch KO had the highest number of backcrosses (17) and the smallest footprint (11.94\u2009cM) consistent with a full congenic KO line. These results demonstrate that our novel approach is a reliable method for the detection of introgressed variants and congenic genes, including the estimation of the number of backcrosses in each KO line.\n\nFig. 3\nDissection of variants linked to targeted genes: the congenic footprint. a A pipeline for the detection of KO-linked variants based on intersected VCF files per genotype as input. We ignored header lines from the inputted VCF file (Filter and Sort program, skipping header lines starting with #). We performed genotype annotation with the VCFAnnotateGenotypes program on null VCF files using the WT counterpart. After selecting lines that not match \u201cAdded-genotypes\u201d, we obtained an output with KO-linked variants. b To obtain KO-linked genes from variants in (A), we assessed annotation of variants per genotype with the variant effect predictor program from Ensembl (VEP) and then subtracted KO-linked genes with the aid of Venn diagrams. c Histogram of KO-linked variants for the Gtf2ird1 KO. We binned the genomic coordinates of each chromosome every 10 million bases, and then plotted the variants as frequency histograms according to these positions. The number of congenic genes encompassing these variants is indicated. d The same histogram as in (C) for Mecp2 KO located in Chr X. e The same histogram as in (C) for Sall2 KO located on Chr 14. f The same histogram as in (C) for Stc1 KO located on Chr 14. g The same histogram as in (C) for Itch KO located on Chr 2. This KO presents four chromosomes with KO-linked variants (Chr 2, 9, 10 and 16). The total number of congenic genes encompassing these variants is indicated. h Predicted number of backcrossings with C57BL/6J mice per model. Genomic range of KO-linked variants per model were calculated with the pipeline and translated to centimorgans (cM) with the mouse map converter service (http://cgd.jax.org/mousemapconverter/) according to previously published studies [53, 54]. The extension of KO-linked variants per model in cM is depicted in red\nWe reasoned that the inheritance of congenic variants could vary in ploidy among biological replicates, excluding homozygous inheritance in every case. For this reason, we next addressed ploidy of the congenic footprint in the same KO lines. We focused on the Sall2 and Stc1 KOs, as both genes are located on Chr 14. In the Sall2 KO, 1006 variants were predicted with 80% homozygosity linked to the KO genotype (Additional file 5: Table S3 ). We noticed a center-oriented distribution of these variants (Fig. 4a). To study inheritance of these variants and further characterize the ploidy of the congenic footprint, we used variants from a heterozygous Sall2 MEF littermate. If the inheritance of the footprint is Mendelian, we reasoned that heterozygous calls in the heterozygous Sall2 MEF (Sall2+/\u2212) will contain the introgressed variants (Fig. 4b). We found 178 homozygous and 1977 heterozygous variants in the Sall2+/\u2212 MEF littermate (Additional file 6: Table S1 and S2 ) also with center-oriented distribution of the heterozygous variants (Fig. 4c). We used heterozygous variants from these MEFs to annotate genotypes on the previous 1006 predicted Sall2-KO linked variants. In agreement with the prediction, 906 variants were annotated using this procedure, covering 91.2% of the Sall2-KO introgressed genes (Figs. 4d, e and Additional file 6: Tables S3-S4). Thus, inheritance of the Sall2-KO linked variants is homozygous in its extension.\n\nFig. 4\nPloidy of congenic footprint. a Histogram of KO-linked variants for Sall2 KO distinguishing homozygous (red bars) from heterozygous (blue bars) variants. We binned the genomic coordinates of each chromosome every 10 million bases and plotted the variants with each ploidy as frequency histograms according to these positions. b Cartoon depicting the congenic footprinting of each embryo in the Sall2 KO, located on Chr 14.

We represented each ploidy with a distinct color (homozygous segment in red, heterozygous segment in blue). Chromosomal positions are indicated\nWe then investigated the influence of the congenic footprint on gene expression using Sall2-KO MEFs (Fig. 5a). To study the 129P2 genome introgression on Chr 14, we compared the transcriptome of WT versus KO MEFs, identifying 520 DEGs with FDR\u2009<\u20090.01 (Additional file 7: Table S1). Gene ontology analysis showed several clusters of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, virus response and cell adhesion, among others, suggesting an association of Sall2 with these biological functions (Additional file 7: Table S2). We confirmed several DEGs by qPCR, including non-coding genes, such as Rmrp, the pre-ribosomal transcript, Rn45s, and genes located in the introgressed region, such as Ang, Rpph1, Gch1, and Anxa8 (Fig. 5b). To address whether these genes are Sall2-dependent, we silenced Sall2 in WT MEFs using a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and then performed qPCR to examine the impact of Sall2 silencing within the same genetic background (Fig. 5c). From all the genes tested, only Gch1, Rpph1, Ang, and Cd36 were affected by Sall2 silencing, but with different fold changes compared with that obtained using RNA-Seq analysis (see Pnp in Fig. 5d). Although qPCR analysis initially showed that Pnp was downregulated in Sall2-KO MEFs, this result was an artifact resulting from poor reverse primer hybridization due to mismatches in the genomic region, confounding the analysis of Pnp in Sall2-KO cells (Fig. 5e).\n\nFig. 5\nThe congenic footprint influences gene expression of Sall2-KO MEFs. a Cartoon comparing a segment of Chr 14 in Sall2 WT versus Sall2-KO MEFs.

In the case of the Sall2-KO MEFs, about 204 genes on Chr 14 were congenic; therefore, we expected genetic interference with the KO mutation (Additional file 5: Table S6). Out of the 204 genes, 61 carried missense mutations, and 17 were DEGs (Additional file 8: Table 1). To identify potential modifier genes in the congenic region of the Sall2 KO, we applied the eQTL strategy [56]. We propose a pipeline for the detection of candidate eQTLs, based on the linear dependence between expression and genotype, as previously described [57]. We obtained normalized gene counts of congenic genes from Sall2 WT as well as heterozygous and KO MEFs and tested linear regression against arbitrary values for each genotype (WT\u2009=\u20091, Het\u2009=\u20090.5, and KO\u2009=\u20090) (Fig. 6a).\n\nFig. 6\nScreening of eQTLs in the Sall2 KO congenic region. a Pipeline based on the linear dependency of gene expression to genotype for the detection of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in congenic regions. Digital counts of gene expression from congenic DEGs in WT, heterozygous and KO genotypes are normalized (e.g. RUVSeq package, available in Bioconductor) and used for further analysis. Then, lineal regression of gene counts across genotypes is obtained, previously defining arbitrary values for each genotype (WT\u2009=\u20091, Het\u2009=\u20090.5, KO\u2009=\u20090).

SALL2 is known to induce Cdkn1a in neurons, ovarian epithelial cells and MEFs under genotoxic stress [33, 62, 63]. On the other hand, ANG negatively regulates p21CIP/WAF through p53 degradation in human cells [64, 65]. Cdkn1a was not detected as a DEG in the RNA-Seq analysis by comparing Sall2 WT vs KO MEFs. Therefore, genetic interference with Cdkn1a transcription is likely to occur in Sall2- KO mice due to the existence of a congenic footprint. We noticed minor changes in p21 protein and Cdkn1a mRNA levels between Sall2 WT and KO MEFs (Fig. 7a and b, respectively). Conversely, shRNA-mediated Sall2 silencing in Sall2 WT MEFs showed strong downregulation of p21 protein and Cdkn1a mRNA levels, consistently with previous reports [63, 66] (Fig. 7c and d, respectively). We hypothesized that the downregulation of ANG partly explains the unchanged p21 protein and Cdkn1a mRNA levels in Sall2-KO MEFs. In agreement with this hypothesis, mature ANG expression into Sall2 WT MEFs readily downregulated p21 protein and Cdkn1a mRNA levels, assuming transcriptional repression of Cdkn1a by ANG (Fig. 7e and f, respectively). Surprisingly, we did not see this effect on endogenous P53 protein levels (TRP53), as previously reported [64]. A model of Cdkn1a regulation was proposed based on SALL2 and ANG as opposite regulators. In the Sall2-silencing model, mild downregulation of ANG protein levels is achieved; thus, the activator of Cdkn1a (SALL2) is in very low levels while the repressor (ANG) is present, downregulating Cdkn1a (Fig. 7g, upper). Conversely, in the Sall2 KO model, the activator is lost, and the repressor is expressed at low levels, relieving the inhibition on Cdkn1a (Fig. 7g, lower). These suggest that ANG exerts transcriptional regulation on Cdkn1a in a manner that opposes SALL2, interfering Cdkn1a regulation in Sall2-KO cells.\n\nFig. 7\nGenetic interference of Cdkn1a, a canonical target of Sall2. a Left: Representative Western blot for SALL2, P21, and ACTIN in Sall2 WT and KO cells.

A summary of the advantages and disadvantages of SNP genotyping and the pipeline are presented in Table 1. For example, our pipeline, which is based on NGS sequencing data, is versatile (accepts WGS/WES/RNA-Seq data) and greatly outperforms dense SNP arrays in sensibility and detection of novel/rare variants (especially DNA-Seq data [67]). Furthermore, it allows visual estimation of the extension of variants with the aid of histograms containing variant frequency per chromosome. As reported, SNP arrays have fixed sensibility and do not perform well in detecting rare variants, including novel variants [68].Table 1\nAdvantages and Disadvantages for the use of NGS data in genetic background characterization\n\nWe reviewed the advantages and disadvantages in genetic monitoring using NGS data (through our pipeline) versus SNP-dense microarrays. We considered implementation, computational resources, rare variant detection, novel variant discovery, QTL detection, sensibility and visualization in each method\n\n\nAdditional file 1:\nSchematic view of the sources of genetic variation identified in KO/KI congenic mice. First, the choice of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from the inbred brown mice is a major source of genetic variation, and genetic characterization of these cells could be unavailable (1). Second, the number of backcrossing with C57BL/6 (substrain N or J) will lead to variable introgression of variants from ESCs into littermates, depending on how many backcrossings were performed (2). Finally, further breeding strategies across generations will determine the final constitution of variants in WT and KO/KI littermates, including the congenic footprint (3). The N of crossings will also determine the number of novel fixed variants in animals. Mice images were designed by the authors.

The causative spirochetes have reservoirs in mammalian hosts, but there has been limited analysis of the genomes of isolates recovered from animals. The aims of this study were to characterize genomic features of two Leptospira interrogans strains recently isolated from asymptomatic dogs in Thailand (strains CUDO5 and CDUO8), and to perform comparative genome analyses with other strains. Molecular adaptive evolution in L. interrogans as signaled by positive selection also was analyzed.Whole genome sequence analysis revealed that strains CUDO5 and CUDO8 had genome sizes of approximately 4.9 Mbp with 35.1% GC contents. Using monoclonal antibodies, strains CUDO5 and CUDO8 were identified as serovars Paidjan and Dadas, respectively. These strains harbored genes known to be associated with acute and chronic infections. Using Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms phylogeny (SNPs) with 97\u2009L. interrogans strains, CUDO5 and CUDO8 had closest genetic relatedness with each other. Nevertheless, the serovar determinant region (rfb locus) showed variations in the genes encoding sugar biosynthesis. Amongst 13 representative L. interrogans strains examined for molecular adaptive evolution through positive selection under the site-model of Phylogenetic Analysis of Maximum Likelihood, genes responsible for iron acquisition (tlyA and hbpA), motility (fliN2, flgK, and flhB) and thermal adaptation (lpxD1) were under increased selective pressure.L. interrogans serovar Paidjan strain CUDO5 and serovar Dadas strain CUDO8 had close genetic relatedness as analyzed by SNPs phylogeny. They contained genes with established roles in acute and chronic leptospirosis. The rfb locus in both serovars showed gene variation associated with sugar biosynthesis. Positive selection analysis indicated that genes encoding factors involved in motility, temperature adaptation, and iron acquisition were under strong positive selection in L. interrogans. These may be associated with adaptation in the early stages of infection.Gram-negative spirochetes of the genus Leptospira cause the disease Leptospirosis, which is one of the most important zoonotic infectious conditions worldwide, including in Thailand [1, 2]. Pathogenic Leptospira strains can infect most mammals and produce a wide range of clinical manifestations varying from acute life-threatening disease to chronic asymptomatic forms [3]. In humans, leptospirosis is estimated to have a worldwide annual average morbidity of 1.03 million cases with a mortality of 58,900 cases, and these figures are poised to increase due to climate change [4]. Asymptomatic animals that are carrying leptospires in the convoluted tubules of the kidney play an important role in disease maintenance and in transmission via infected urine [1].Based on DNA-DNA hybridization and 16S rRNA phylogeny, Leptospira can be classified into more than 22 species located within three groups: the pathogenic, intermediate and non-pathogenic groups. In addition, more than 300 serovars have been described based on antigenic diversity in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structure on the cell surface. These different serovars can be identified using the cross-agglutination absorption test (CAAT) [3].Pathogenic L. interrogans serovar Lai strain 56601 was the first leptospire to be subjected to genome sequencing, and the data obtained revealed the unique physiological characteristics and virulence factors of this strain [5]. Subsequently, the genomes of a number of other both pathogenic and non-pathogenic Leptospira strains have been subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS) to investigate the genetic basis of pathogenesis [6]. Using comparative genomic analysis, pathogenic markers were defined based on gene gain and loss events, and genome rearrangements were identified [6\u20138]. An aspect that has not been explored for Leptospira is measurement of selective pressure, inferred by non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rate in genes in conserved genome regions, signaling that the genes are under positive selection: in other species these adaptations have been shown to have an important role in species diversification and adaptation in different ecological niches and hosts [9].In pathogenic bacteria, positive selection is an evolutionary driving force arising by mutations in protein-coding genes that are associated with bacterial adaptation to changes in their environment or host species [10]. Advantageous point mutations enhance bacterial physiological fitness or virulence factor profiles appropriate to survival under various conditions [11]. Genome-wide analyses of positive selection associated with increased rates of point mutations in specific genes has been reported for several bacteria, including Bacteroides fragilis [12], Escherichia coli [13, 14], Mycobacterium tuberculosis [15], Salmonella serotypes [16] and Pasteurella multocida [17]. To date reports of positive selection in Leptospira remain scarce, and there is still a lack of genomic information for Leptospira isolates recovered from asymptomatic animals.In the present study, we determined the serotypes and then sequenced the genomes of two L. interrogans isolates that were recently recovered from the urine of asymptomatic Thai dogs. We then undertook comparative analysis with these genomes and 22 other representatives of validly published Leptospira genomes obtained from the NCBI database. The Thai L. interrogans strains were subjected to genomic characterization and phylogenetic analysis to examine evolutionary relationships. Within-species, comparative genome analysis was performed with 97 strains of L. interrogans to obtain insight into the pan-genome structure. Strain-specific genes of the two Thai strains that were associated with specific functions including virulence also were identified. Furthermore, a genome-wide analysis for positive selection was undertaken on the core genes of L. interrogans to determine genes involved in adaptive evolution. The results provide insight into the Leptospira genome and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of factors involved in molecular pathogenesis and adaptive evolution in pathogenic Leptospira.According to PHASTER analysis, no intact bacteriophage (phage) was identified in strains CUDO5 or CUDO8. However, incomplete phages with sizes ranging from 6.1 to 11.4 Kbp were found in both strains: these included PHAGE_Synech_ACG_2014b_NC_027130, PHAGE_Synech_ACG_2014f_NC_026927, PHAGE_Psychr_pOW20_A_NC_020841 and PHAGE_Sphing_PAU_NC_019521. None of these predicted phages contained any sequences associated with known pathogenicity islands or antimicrobial resistance genes. Most of the Leptospira species and strains contained incomplete phages with sizes ranging from 4.1 to 13.8 Kbp, but the only one shared was PHAGE_Sphing_PAU_NC_019521, which was found in 11 of the 13\u2009L. interrogans strains (Additional file 1: Table S2).In the current study, serotyping using pAbs and mAbs showed that L. interrogans strain CUDO5 belonged to serogroup Bataviae (pAbs titer\u2009=\u20091:640), with close similarity to L. interrogans serovar Paidjan (mAbs titer\u2009=\u20091:20480), whilst strain CUDO8 belonged to serogroup Grippotyphosa (pAbs titer >\u20091:1280) with antigenic similarity to L. kirschneri serovar Dadas (mAbs titer\u2009=\u20091:20480).Analysis of the lipopolysacharide biosynthesis (rfb) locus from the whole genome sequence data demonstrated that serovar Paidjan (strain CUDO5) contained nucleotide sequences of approximately 116 Kbp, which was larger than for serovar Dadas (strain CUDO8) that harbored nucleotides of around 114 Kbp. These regions encoded 125 and 113 genes for serovar Paidjan and Dadas, respectively (Additional file 1: Tables S8 and S9). In agreement with a previous report [6], the upstream and downstream flanking genes in the rfb locus were conserved, with petE encoding copper-binding protein and rpsF encoding 30S ribosomal protein S6 being present in both serovars (Additional file 2: Figure S1). The complete gene cluster of dTDP-rhamnose biosynthesis (rfb ABCD) and genes related to rhamnose containing glycan (rfbB and galE) were found in these two rfb loci. Besides rhamnose biosynthesis genes, serovar Dadas contained additional genes involved with capsular heptose biosynthesis (fcl, gmhA and rfbC). Sialic acid biosynthesis genes including neuA1 and neuB2 were found within the rfb locus of serovar Paidjan. The gene encoding bacillosamine/legionaminic acid aminotransferase (pglE), which plays a role in protein glycosylation via the N,N\u2032-diacetylbacillosamine biosynthesis pathway, was found in both serovars. Three aminotransferases belonging to the DegT family that are involved with LPS O-antigen side chain biosynthesis were identified in serovar Paidjan. Genes related to the Wzx/Wzy-dependent pathway (wzx and wzy) were not situated in the rfb locus of either strain, but were located elsewhere in the genome (BLASTP analysis). A total of 11 enzymes for lipid A biosynthesis encoded by htrB, kdsA, kdsB2, kdtA, lnt, lpxA, lpxB1, lpxC, lpxD1, lpxD2 and lpxK were present across the Thai Paidjan and Dadas genomes, but both lacked lpxB2 and kdsB1 (BLASTP analysis) that are found in L. interrogans serovar Lai strain 56601 [6].The results from the JSpecies analysis showed that the ANI percentages among the genus Leptospira varied widely from 64.17 to 99.19% for pairwise genome comparisons in the pathogenic, intermediate, and non-pathogenic Leptospira groups. For example, genomic comparison between L. wofflii and L. biflexa revealed 64.17% nucleotide similarity, whereas L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni and L. interrogans serovar Djasiman had 99.19% nucleotide similarity (Additional file 3: Table S1). Moreover, in 13 representative L. interrogans strains, the ANI values gave a similarity percentage of more than 98%. Strains CUDO5 and CUDO8 had the highest ANI values to each other (99.08%).The core gene set across the L. interrogans strains (n\u2009=\u200997) was made up of 734 gene\u00a0families, whilst the accessory gene set varied from 2062 to 3303 gene families (Additional file 3: Table S3). The functional classification of the gene repertoire in core- and strain-specific genes according to COG categories was different. Core-genes encoding for proteins related to category J (Translation, ribosomal structure and biosynthesis), E (Amino acid transport and metabolism) and R (General prediction only) were abundant among the total core-genes identified, whereas strain-specific genes encoding for proteins involved in categories R (General function prediction only), L (Replication, recombination and repair) and M (Cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis) were over-assigned among this set of genes. The COG distribution of the core-, accessory and strain-specific genes are shown in Fig. 6b.The pan-genome analysis of the 97\u2009L interrogans strains identified genes that were only found in the two Thai canine strains (i.e. were specific to them). L. interrogans strain CUDO5 contained eight strain-specific genes, of which seven could not be classified by eggNOG; hypothetical protein. One gene was found using an NCBI database search, and its predicted product resembled a type III restriction endonuclease. In strain CUDO8, BPGA identified three strain-specific genes, of which two were classified as hypothetical proteins, and the other was assigned as phage terminase large subunit.To obtain more insight into positive selection based on protein tertiary structure, amino acid residues under positive selection were mapped on 3D-modeled protein structures. Of the 101 genes under positive selection and predicted to be related to putative virulence in Leptospira, four representative proteins that have been experimentally confirmed to be virulence factor of pathogenic Leptospira were selected for this analysis: hemolysin A (encoded by tlyA); TonB-hemin binding receptor (encoded by hbpA); flagella motor switch protein (encoded by fliN2); and UDP-3-O-(3-hydroxymyristoryl) glucosamine N-acyltransferase (encoded by lpxD1). These all had values of \u03c9\u2009>\u20091, significant q-values, and a high confidence of obtaining 3D-protein-based homology predictions. The tlyA, hbpA, fliN2 and lpxD1 genes encoded proteins made up of 259, 776, 178 and 340 amino acid residues, respectively.The present study reports the first genomic characterization of L. interrogans strains isolated from dogs in Thailand, and presents a comparative genome analysis of these with the published genomes of another 12 Leptospira species. Moreover, a genome-wide scan of genes under positive selection, focusing on potential virulence factors of L. interrogans, was undertaken to obtain insights into genetic diversity, molecular pathogenesis and molecular adaptation of the Leptospira strains.L. interrogans serovar Paidjan strain CUDO5 and L. interrogans serovar Dadas strain CUDO8 were isolated from the urine of asymptomatic dogs in an area of Thailand with a high frequency of human leptospirosis, and a 9.92% prevalence in animals. Evidence from previous rrs phylogenetic analysis has revealed close genetic links between isolates from animals and humans in this area [19]. Therefore, theses strains have epidemiological importance and potentially may pose a risk to public health in the region. The availability of genome sequences from both Thai Leptospira serovars provides useful new information relating to disease diagnosis and prevention.Analysis of the genomes of the two Thai strains demonstrated that they had similar numbers of CDSs and sub-system categories to other analyzed L. interrogans strains. Most of the genes encoded proteins responsible for basic biological processes such as transcription, translation, cell wall synthesis and motility, and the findings confirm the high conservation of CDSs among L. interrogans strains.Phages are viruses that infect specific bacterial hosts, and are abundant in the environment [20]. Prophage-related genes were found in the Leptospira genomes, presenting as incomplete phages without any obvious association with pathogenicity islands or antimicrobial resistant genes, but with diverse prophage types (Additional file 1: Table S3). In this study, Sphingomonas phage (PHAGE_Sphing_PAU_NC_019521) was found in 11 of the 13 representative L. interrogans strains, and this phage potentially could be exchanged between L. interrogans and Sphingonomas paucimobilis in shared environments such as in water sources [21].The CRISPR-Cas system is defined as part of the bacterial adaptive immune system. This system can remember and destroy phages and plasmids invading the host cell by producing specific crRNA against these elements [18]. Our results are in agreement with a previous study where the CRISPR-Cas system was found only in intermediate and pathogenic group strains, which harbored at least one subtype of CRISPR1, whereas non-pathogenic Leptospira species did not have this system [6]. The CRISPR-Cas system has been thought to be a necessary functional system in pathogenic Leptospira [6]. The strains from dogs in this study possessed two CRISPR1 loci (subtypes I-B and I-C). CRISPR1 subtype I-B targets foreign DNA invasion, while the function of subtype I-C is still uncharacterized. These two loci of the CRISPR-Cas system also are found in Pyrococcus furiosus, suggesting its ability to use crRNA to defend against a wide range of foreign genetic material, including both DNA and RNA [22]. Various crRNAs targeting either plasmids or phages in various species were identified in L. interrogans serovar Dadas strain CUDO8 (n\u00a0=\u200940) and to a lesser extent in L. interrogans serovar Paidjan strain CUDO5 (n\u00a0=\u200931) (Additional file 1: Table S4). The difference suggests that CUDO8 may have been subjected to infection with more phages and plasmids than CUDO5. The fact that the plasmid of L. interrogans serovar Linhai strain 56609 was found in CUDO5 and CUDO8 might reflect their shared evolutionary history, or transfer of the plasmid during their occupation of shared microenvironmental niches before their dissemination to different hosts. On the other hand, it should be noted that crRNAs targets predicted by bioinformatics programs quite commonly have non-specific or coincidental hits (both plasmid and phage), especially when querying with short sequences. Therefore, a CRISPR interference assay is required to validate the crRNAs target results relating to interference with foreign genetic material in Leptospira [23].The presence of virulence genes associated with the pathogenesis of leptospirosis have been used to divide Leptospira species and strains into three groups: pathogenic, intermediate and non-pathogenic [24]. In this study, we identified virulence factors present in strains CUDO5 and CUDO8 genomes using the VFDB database. However, VFDB searching has some limitations since virulence genes/proteins with confirmed roles in other bacteria might not reflect their function in strains CUDO5 and CUDO8. Therefore, a combination search with orthologous virulence genes with established roles in acute and chronic leptospirosis also was undertaken. All pathogenic Leptospira strains contained genes encoding catalase, collagenase, TonB-hemin binding receptor, immunoglobulin-like protein B and sphingomyelinases, which all are confirmed as virulence markers during the early stage of infection [24]. On the other hand, intermediate and non-pathogenic Leptospira lack many of these virulence genes: their acquisition may reflect an evolutionary process favoring host infection and disease [6], whilst loss of these genes may result in attenuation and reduction in virulence. Although strains CUDO5 and CUDO8 have genes with confirmed roles as virulence factors, they were isolated from the urine of asymptomatic dogs. Their ability to establish persistent infections with long-term kidney colonization is likely to reflect a balance of gene content and expression that favors an advantageous carrier state - maximizing the opportunity for further transmission via urine.Comparative genome analysis can be used to understand genomic diversity and provide insights into biological functions and evolution [25]. Using the power law exponents of Heap\u2019s law, our data indicated that L. interrogans strains have an open pan-genome [6, 7]. This finding suggests that the gene pool of the spirochetes can expand, and the observed genomic plasticity probably results from multiple ways of incorporating new genetic material into their genomes such as through horizontal gene transfer and/or replication of advantageous genes via gene duplication [7]. This phenomenon is beneficial in relation to adaptations resulting in increased infectivity and survival in a broad range of mammalian hosts and the environment [1].The Leptospira species that were analyzed were separated into three groups using DNA-DNA hybridization as well as by virulence gene profiles [6]. The 13 representative strains of L. interrogans had ANI values of over 98%, suggesting that nucleotide sequences of L. interrogans strains are mostly conserved, even though the strains were of different serovars and were from different origins and epidemiological units. The ML-based core-SNPs phylogenetic analysis identified both distinct and clustered Leptospira serovars in the same branch of the phylogenetic tree. This finding reflected the diversity of the Leptospira strains, even amongst those coming from the same geographical origins. It also inferred different accumulations of SNPs in the core genome in each strain. Moreover, there were instances of connectivity between human and animal Leptospira isolates, providing genetic evidence supporting the occurrence of disease maintenance in animals and cross-species transmission. Notably, the phylogenetic tree confirmed that the two Thai canine strains were closely related to each other. However, the serotyping results revealed that they belonged to different serogroups and serovars (serogroup Bataviae serovar Paidjan for strain CUDO5 and serogroup Grippotyphosa serovar Dadas for strain CUDO8). Consistent with the rfb locus analysis, serovars Paidjan and Dadas had gene variations in these regions. Nevertheless, genes association with rhamnose biosynthesis (rfb ABCD) and rhamnose containing glycan (rfbB and galE) were distributed in both serovars. Previously, the LPS of pathogenic Leptospira has been shown to contain more rhamnose than intermediate Leptospira, and moreover specific sugars were found related to particular serovars [26]. This finding was in agreement with our results in the case of serovar Dadas that contained three additional genes associated with capsular heptose biosynthesis. Furthermore, the gene encoding aminotransferase PglE that was found in both serovars might play a crucial role in creating novel sugar composition during the glycosylation process of outer membrane proteins [27]. The three aminotransferases belonging to the DegT family in serovar Paidjan might be associated with LPS O-antigen side chain biosynthesis, leading to differences between the serological characteristics of the serovars [28]. These findings provided possible explanations for the difference in LPS composition and outer membrane protein post-translational modifications between serovars Paidjan and Dadas. However, more experiments are required to compare the relationship of the genes in the rfb locus, sugar composition, sugar ramification and structural determination of the LPS, since there are large variations and complexities in this material [1]. A previous investigation of the LPS of pathogenic and intermediately pathogenic Leptospira species using multiple methods including LPS extraction, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and electron microscopy revealed significant differences in terms of carbohydrate and fatty acid composition, including in Leptospira isolated from common reservoir hosts [26]. The presence of large quantities of a specific sugar in a particular serovar is believed to play an important role for survival and colonization in certain environments [26]. Therefore, a combination of genomic detail and biochemical and structural analysis will allow a better understanding of LPS biology in the adaptation strategies in these two pathogenic Leptospira.In bacteria, strain-specific genes are associated with specific functions and niche adaptations [25]. Strains CUDO5 and CUDO8 harbored strain-specific genes compared to the other strains in this study (n\u2009=\u200997), but these were mostly predicted as hypothetical proteins with unknown functions. Nevertheless, strain-specific genes of known function were found in these strains, consisting of; a type III restriction endonuclease and phage terminase large subunit. The function of these genes may be related to the pathogenesis of Leptospira. Notably, type III restriction endonucleases are functionally associated with defense mechanisms against invading foreign DNA. Therefore, this gene possibly functions to protect L. interrogans from phage infection, and could modulate the genetic exchange barrier [29]. As no complete phage was reported in this study, the cryptic prophage including phage terminase large subunit might indicate the existence of a prior phage infection that was probably degraded by the CRISPR-Cas system and/or a restriction modification system, and was subsequently trapped in the Leptospira chromosome [30]. Although the role of phage terminase large subunit in the Leptospira strains was not established, cryptic prophages in E. coli contribute to survival in adverse environment conditions [31]. Therefore, this cryptic prophage might help Leptospira to cope with stress in new hosts and environments.Beneficial mutations in bacterial genes under positive selection can assist in molding bacterial-host adaptation [11], whilst recombination helps positive selection to become fixed in the population [32]. Our investigation of positive selection among the genomes of 13 representative L. interrogans strains focused on genes encoding virulence-associated proteins. Genes under significant positive selection included 101 predicted virulence-associated genes and 352 genes with various functions, including those involved in cell wall/envelope biosynthesis; amino acid transport and coenzyme transport and metabolism; and signal transduction and cell translation: these function in binding and transport of essential nutrients in the early stages of infection and bacterial replication. Using the VFDB database, the genes under positive selection were grouped by virulence functions consisting of adhesion, anti-phagocytosis and iron uptake systems. In Leptospira infection an initial step is adhesion at the site of abrasion or on mucous membranes. In general, several adhesion factors are responsible for attachment to a variety of cell surfaces, such as the extracellular matrix (ECM), complement factors, macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelium cells and kidney cells [6, 33]. Therefore, positive selection could enhance adhesion ability and assist Leptospira in spreading throughout the body during the initial stages of infection. Moreover, positive selection was found on binding sites involved in immune recognition. Protein conformational changes may be part of a strategy for anti-phagocytosis by using surface adhesion-related proteins to trap complement factors and in turn avoid opsonization and IgG deposition on the leptospiral surface membrane [34]. In this study, four genes encoding experimentally confirmed virulence factors in pathogenic Leptospira were selected to construct 3D-structure models with positive selection site mapping to investigate possible functional implications of changes to the proteins (genes tlyA, hbpA, fliN2 and lpxD1). Specific amino acids in each molecule were identified as being under positive selection, but the significance of these in relation to their structure and function was not investigated further. Genes related to iron uptake systems were under positive selection, including the tlyA gene encoding hemolysin A and hbpA encoding the TonB-hemin binding receptor for which the structures were analyzed. These genes may provide a synergistic effect for iron acquisition from red blood cells during Leptospira infection [35]. Previously, endoflagella and protein-related LPS biosynthesis were confirmed as true virulence factors in pathogenic Leptospira [36]. In the present study, we found positive selection on genes associated with endoflagella, including fliN2 encoding for flagella motor switch protein, flgK encoding for flagella hook-associated protein, and flhB encoding for polar flagella protein. This positive selection is likely to be important for motility of Leptospira, allowing translocation, penetration and dissemination in host tissues [37, 38]. The gene lpxD1 encoding for UDP-3-O-(3-hydroxymyristoryl) glucosamine N-acyltransferase that is involved with lipid A biosynthesis as part of the LPS structure also was subjected to positive selection. Studies have shown that alterations to the gene lpxD contribute to modification in lipid A, and subsequently influence outer membrane integrity when bacteria are subjected to changing temperatures [36, 39]. Therefore, the positive selection on lpxD1 may be involved in assisting Leptospira to adapt to temperature differences in mammalian hosts. Additionally, mutations in lpxD1 have been considered to be involved with kidney and liver colonization by Leptospira in an asymptomatic animal model. It also has been suggested that pathogenic Leptospira have lipid A modification strategies to evade immune response in the early stage of infection, leading to development of chronic leptospirosis in mammalian hosts [40]. The gene colA encoding for collagenase (ColA) showed evidence of both positive selection and recombination in this study. ColA has been experimentally confirmed as a virulence factor in Leptospira [41]. Positive selection in colA might promote Leptospira invasiveness in the host body, whilst recombination of this gene might facilitate spread of advantageous mutations to other Leptospira [32, 41].Pathogenic Leptospira have the ability to cause chronic infection by evading the host immune response [42]. Several different strategies have been described for immune evasion including biofilm formation, an increase in LPS O-antigen, and down-regulation of outer membrane proteins [43\u201345]. Moreover, during prolonged infections immune pressures acting on such pathogens are likely to select for advantageous genetic variation within the genome, leading to accumulation of mutations that increase survival fitness or that cause loss of function in virulence factors [46]. The balance of these genetic alterations may contribute to the strain\u2019s adaptation and establishment of a reservoir/carrier state in an animal. Our study has improved understanding of genetic adaptation in this important zoonotic pathogen and provided promising gene targets for further research. This should lead to development of better control strategies, such as improved vaccines and more accurate diagnostic tests for use in the region.This study provided genomic data and characterization of Thai L. interrogans serovar Paidjan stain CUDO5 and L. interrogans serovar Dadas strain CUDO8 isolated from the urine of asymptomatic dogs; furthermore, comparative genomic analysis with the genomes of 97\u2009L. interrogans strains were undertaken and revealed an open pan-genome for the strains. Genes with established roles in acute and chronic leptospirosis were found in both Thai canine strains. Core-SNPs phylogeny confirmed their close genetic relatedness, but the rfb locus analysis identified genetic variations between them that were consistent with the different serotyping results. Genes under positive selection were identified, including genes encoding factors involved in motility, temperature adaptation, and iron acquisition: these may be involved in bacterial dissemination, thermal adaptation and nutrient uptake. Further investigations into the functions and expression of these genes, including in vivo experiments are required to expand these findings.With approval by the Chulalongkorn University Animal Care and Use Committee (CU-ACUC; Protocol number 1531075) and the Institutional Biosafety Committee (CU-VET-IBC; Protocol number 18310430), two Thai L. interrogans strains named CUDO5 and CUDO8 that were isolated from the urine of asymptomatic dogs in Nan province, Thailand (year 2014), were used in this study. The bacteria were identified to species level by partial rrs sequencing and comparative phylogeny, and were assigned as novel sequence types (ST) ST26 and ST33 respectively by multilocus sequence analysis of seven housekeeping genes (caiB, glumU, mreA, pfkB, pntA, sucA and tpiA) [19].L. interrogans strains CUDO5 and CUDO8 that were passaged less than five times were kept as stock culture and stored at \u2212\u200980\u2009\u00b0C before use. A 500\u2009\u03bcL volume of each thawed stock was cultured in 5\u2009mL of liquid Ellinghuasen-McCullough-Johnson-Harris (EMJH) medium with 3% rabbit serum, and incubated at 30\u2009\u00b0C for two weeks. Subsequently, 300\u2009\u03bcL of the cultures were spread on blood agar and incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C for two days to verify lack of contamination with other bacteria by visual inspection of surface growth. To purify and collect the leptospires, the suspensions were centrifuged at 15,000\u00d7g at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 15\u2009min and then the genomic DNA was extracted from the cell-pellet using the Wizard\u00ae Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The quality and quantity of the DNA were measured using a spectrophotometer to obtain the A260/230 ratio (1.51 for CUDO5 and 1.75 for CUDO8) and the A260/280 ratio (1.80 for CUDO5 and 1.83 for CUDO8) (NanoDrop\u2122, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and Qubit\u2122 Fluorometric Quantitation (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), respectively. Genomic DNA was stored at \u2212\u200920\u2009\u00b0C before library preparation and genome sequencing.Serotyping of the L. interrogans strain CUDO5 and CUDO8 was performed at the OIE National Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Leptospirosis, The Netherlands. A total of 43 polyclonal rabbit antisera (pAbs) raised against strains of all pathogenic and non-pathogenic Leptospira serogroups were used in the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) to determine the serogroup (Additional 5, Table 1). Subsequently, the isolates were further identified to the serovar level using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Strains CUDO5 and CUDO8 were subjected to serovar typing employing the whole set of mAbs derived from Leptospira serogroup Bataviae serovar Losbanos strain LT 101\u201369: F129C2, F129C3, F129C4, F129C6, F129C7, F129C9, F129C15, F129C18, F129C19, F129C20, F129C24, F129C25 and F129C26, and Leptospira serogroup Grippotyphosa serovar Grippotyphosa strain Moskva V, serovar Vanderhoedeni strain Kipod 179 and serovar Grippotyphosa strain Dutch M: F71C2, F71C3, F71C9, F71C13, F71C16, F71C17, F164C1, F165C1, F165C2, F165C3, F165C7, F165C8 and F165C12, respectively (https://leptospira.amc.nl/leptospirosis-reference-centre/typing-with-monoclonal-antibodies/) (Additional file 6: Tables S1 and S2).DNA from L. interrogans strains CUDO5 and CUDO8 was subjected to whole genome sequencing and de novo assembly, as previously described [47]. Briefly, DNA libraries were prepared from genomic DNA using the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation kit (Illumina, USA), following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (average insert size\u2009=\u2009375\u2009bp). Genome sequencing was carried out using Illumina MiSeq with a 250 paired-end run cycles. As a consequence of the substantial genetic variation in the serovar determinant region, and to avoid bias using reference mapping, de novo genome assembly was conducted using the A5-Miseq pipeline that consisted of 5 steps including read cleaning and base error correction, contig assembly, crude scaffolding, mis-assembly correction and final scaffolding [48]. Scaffolds were oriented and ordered against the whole genome sequence of L. interrogans serovar Lai strain 56601 using ABACAS [49]. Gaps among the scaffolds were closed using the IMAGE program [50]. The draft genomes of L. interrogans strains CUDO5 and CUDO8 were annotated using rapid prokaryotic genome annotation (PROKKA) [51] and Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology (RAST) version 4.0 [52]. Prophage sequences were identified using the PHASTER web server with the default setting [53]. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and Cas regions were examined by CRISPRone [54]. The spacer results from CRISPRone were further analyzed for CRISPR RNA (crRNA) targets by searching against the GenBank-Phage and RefSeq-Plasmid databases using CRISPRTarget [55]. To predict overall putative virulence genes, the genomes of strains CUDO5 and CUDO8 were search against the virulence factor database (VFDB) [56]. Moreover, a list of previously confirmed virulence genes involved with acute and chronic Leptospira infections was generated based on a literature review of in vitro and in vivo experimental models [24, 36, 57] (Additional file 1: Table S7). From these, 33 representative genes with good data support were selected for gene orthologous identification using amino acid sequences retrieved from UniProt database: these sequences then were subjected to a BLAST search against all proteomic sequences of representative Leptospira strains using BLASTP analysis with an e-value threshold of 1e-06 and protein identity of more than 40% [58]. A heat map of the presence and absence of virulence genes among Leptospira strains was constructed using Clustergrammer with the default parameter [59].Draft genome sequences of L. interrogans strains CUDO5 and CUDO8 were submitted to NCBI\u2019s database as Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) sequences under the accession numbers NKYH02000001.1 and NKYG00000001.1, respectively [47].To define genome relatedness and similarities among members of the genus Leptospira, 22 representative genomes derived from 19 pathogens, two intermediate and one non-pathogen were recruited to be analyzed together with the two Thai Leptospira strains (Table 1). Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) was calculated for each pair of Leptospira genomes by BLASTN analysis using JSpecies with the default setting [60].To examine phylogenomic relationships and gain insights into the evolutionary history of L. interrogans, whole genome sequences for 97\u2009L. interrogans strain were recruited for the analysis (Additional file 3: Table S2), using the genomic sequence of the closely related species L. kirschneri serovar Cynopteri strain 3522 CT (CYN) as an outgroup. The genomes were aligned, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in conserved regions called, recombination sites filtered, and then concatenated as core-single nucleotide polymorphisms (core-SNPs) using parsnps in the Harvest package [61]. A phylogenetic tree constructed from aligned core-SNPs sequence was generated using the maximum-likelihood (ML) method with the GTR model and 1000 bootstrap replicates by RAxML [62]. The tree was edited and visualized using EvolView [63].The 97\u2009L. interrogans genomes were subjected to pan-genome analysis using the Bacterial Pan Genome Analysis Pipeline (BPGA) package, version 1.2 [64]. The GenBank files obtained from the NCBI annotation were used as the input file. Orthologous proteins shared among the L. interrogans strains were clustered using USEARCH with 50% identity cut-off. Cluster of orthologous groups (COG) analysis was used to identify core genes, accessory genes and strain-specific genes. The pan-genome and core-genome were identified using exponential growth and decay models for each newly added L. interrogans genome using the power fit law equation \u201cf(x) = a \u00d7 xb\u201d. A pan-genome curve was generated to examine whether the pan-genome of L. interrogans is open (having an unlimited gene repertoire) or closed (having a limited maximum number of genes in the gene pool) [65]. Moreover, strain-specific genes of strain CUDO5 and CUDO8 were identified using eggNOG [66] and the NCBI database, incorporating default parameters.To detect adaptive evolution in orthologous proteins shared among 13 representative L. interrogans strains, GET_HOMOLOUGUE was used to cluster protein-coding gene alignments with 80% identity and coverage [67]. Each of the 13 representative genome sequences was manually evaluated and converted to codon sequence alignment using PAL2NAL software, version 14.0 [68]. To detect positive selection, the rates of non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions were estimated using the site-model of the CODEML program in the PAML package: this determined the viable ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS, or \u03c9) at substitution sites among codon alignments [69]. Model M1a, that allowed sites in which \u03c9 =1 or\u2009<\u20091, was compared with model M2a that allowed sites with \u03c9\u2009>\u20091. The Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) and the likelihood statistic (2\u0394\u2113) were calculated and compared with the critical value from the \u03c72 distribution with two degrees of freedom. If LRT rejected M1 and accepted M2 with an estimated \u03c9\u2009>\u20091 this was interpreted as evidence of positive selection. The Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) was employed to identify positive selection sites by calculating posterior probability (PP) in each codon using a cut-off PP\u2009>\u20090.95 [70]. Phipack and GENECOV were used to identify genes under positive selection with recombination [71, 72]. Multiple testing corrections were undertaken using the procedure of Benjamini and Hochberg [73]: for all genes identified as being positive for selection, q-values were calculated from p-values using the QVALUE package from R [74], setting a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5% to control false positive detection. A binomial test was used to estimate associations between each of the COG and VFDB categories and the frequency of positive selection.To construct protein tertiary structure, amino acid sequences deduced from genes under positive selection were modeled using homology-based protein modeling with the intensive mode in the Phyre2 (Protein Homology/analogy Recognition Engine) web server [75]. Three-dimensional (3D) protein structure was mapped with amino acid residues under positive selection and visualized by PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular graphic System, Version 2.0 Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC).Average Nucleotide IdentityBayes Empirical BayesCluster of Orthologous GroupClustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeatEllinghuasen-McCullough-Johnson-HarrisLikelihood Ratio TestMonoclonal antibodyPolyclonal antibodySingle Nucleotide PolymorphismVirulence Factor of Bacterial Pathogen DatabaseNot applicable.All data generated or analyzed in this study were obtained from the NCBI database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).

For L. interrogans strain CUDO5, the A5-Miseq de novo genome assembler generated 163 scaffolds with 124.47 times genome coverage and an N50 of 111,967\u2009bp: the genome size was estimated at 4.94 Mbp with a 35.1% GC content. For strain CUDO8, 83 scaffolds were obtained with 109.34 times genome coverage and an N50 of 165,528\u2009bp, with a genome size of approximately 4.91 Mbp and a 35.1% GC content. PROKKA annotation showed that strains CUDO5 and CUDO8 had 4040 and 4013 predicted coding sequences (CDSs), respectively. Both strains only had one copy of each of the three ribosomal RNA genes (5S, 16S and 23S). RAST categorized the functions of the CDSs in strains CUDO5 and CUDO8 into 323 and 320 sub-systems containing 1896 and 1936 CDSs, respectively. Most CDSs in strains CUDO5 and CUDO8 respectively related to RNA metabolism (288/1896 and 296/1936), cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments (284/1896 and 291/1936), amino acids and derivatives (194/1896 and 192/1936), protein metabolism (159/1896 and 167/1936), carbohydrates (149/1896 and 155/1936), cell wall and capsule (131/1896 and 115/1936), and motility and chemotaxis (103/1896 and 105/1936) (Fig.\u00a01). By comparison within and between different strains, the number of CDSs in Leptospira species varied from 3600 to 4342 by PROKKA annotation. In RAST analysis L. santarosai and L. interrogans serovar Lai had the lowest and highest number of CDSs, at 1513 and 1952, respectively (Additional file 1: Table S1).Table 1\nRepresentative Leptospira species and strains used in the study\n\n\nFig. 1\nRAST subsystem annotation in L. interrogans serovar Paidjan strain CUDO5 (pink bar) and serovar Dadas strain CUDO8 (green bar). The functional subsystem category with the largest number of annotations is RNA metabolism, following by Cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments, and Amino acids and derivatives, respectively\nA CRISPR-Cas system was identified in strains CUDO5, CUDO8 and in some of the other strains using the CRISPRone web tool. Interestingly, non-pathogenic L. biflexa lacked this system. Direct repeats (DRs) were not identified in the genomes of L. borgpetersenii, L. alstonii, L. kmetyi, L. lincerasiae and L. wolffi; however, specific Cas proteins related to the CRISPR-Cas system were predicted in these Leptospira species. In this study, we followed the CRISPR-Cas system classification criteria that broadly categorize the CRISPR-Cas system into two classes (Class 1 and Class 2). The CRISPR-Cas system class 1 (CRISPR1) consists of three types (type I, III and IV), whilst the CRISPR-Cas system class 2 (CRISPR2) harbors two types (type II and V), with subdivision into 16 distinct subtypes based on different combinations of Cas protein [18]. Based on the presence of specific Cas proteins, several CRISPR1 subtypes were predicted in representative Leptospira species, including subtypes I-A, I-B, I-C and I-E (Additional file 1: Table S3). Among the L. interrogans strains, including CUDO5 and CUDO8, two CRISPR1 loci (subtype I-B and subtype I-C) were found (Fig.\u00a02a). The CRISPR1 subtype I-B locus contained seven cas genes (cas1, cas2, cas3, cas5, cas6, cas7 and cas8b3) flanked with different numbers of DRs and spacers, while the CRISPR1 subtype I-C was an orphan locus that harbored seven cas genes (cas1, cas2, cas3HD, cas4, cas5, cas7 and cas8c) without a flanking CRISPR array region. The CRISPR array region of strain CUDO5 consisted of 4 DRs with nucleotide lengths from 36 to 39\u2009bp and 15 spacers, whereas strain CUDO8 harbored 4 DRs with nucleotide lengths from 35 to 48\u2009bp and had 36 spacers (Fig. 2b). Spacer sequences predicted from CRISPRone were used to find CRISPR RNA (crRNA) targeting specific foreign sequences using the CRISPRTarget web tool. The plasmid lcp1 of L. interrogans serovar Linhai strain 56609 and Synechococcus phage ACG-2014b gave maximum matching scores in strain CUDO5. On the other hand, Leptospira phage LnoZ_CZ214 and plasmid lcp3 of L. interrogans serovar Linhai strain 56609 showed maximum matching scores in strain CUDO8 (Fig.\u00a03).\n\nFig. 2\nCRISPR-Cas gene organization in L. interrogans serovar Paidjan strain CUDO5 and serovar Dadas strain CUDO8. Strains CUDO5 and CUDO8 contained CRISPR1 subtypes I-B and I-C. CRISPR1 subtype I-B is a complete locus flanked with a CRISPR array which harbors specific direct repeats (DRs) and spacers (panel a), with different quantities based on the time of exogenous DNA exposure (panel b)\n\n\nFig. 3\nGraphical display of CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and target protospacer DNA in L. interrogans serovar Paidjan strain CUDO5 and serovar Dadas strain CUDO8. Spacer specific sequences are transcribed to crRNA to protect against phage and plasmid re-infection. The crRNA in strains CUDO5 and CUDO8 gave highest matching scores to a plasmid of L. interrogans serovar Linhai strain 56609. Colored yellow indicates the complementary matching between spacer and target protospacer sequence; red indicates the mismatching of spacer and target protospacer sequence and blue represents the flanking sequence between spacer and target protospacer\nBy searching in the VFDB database, the genomes of L. interrogans strains CUDO5 and CUDO8 were shown to encode 518 and 512 putative virulence factors, respectively. The predicted virulence genes were involved with motility, chemotaxis, toxins, adhesion molecules and iron uptake systems, amongst others (Additional file 1: Tables S5 and S6). The BLAST results for gene orthologous identification among representative Leptospira strains using amino acid sequences from 33 confirmed virulence factors showed that BtuE, ClpB, FlaA, FliY, HbpA, HemO, LipL45, Loa22, Mce, OmpL1, TlyA, TlyB and TlyC were distributed in all Leptospira strains. Genes encoding KatE, HtpG, ColA, Lig and Sph tended to be restricted to pathogenic Leptospira strains. Strains CUDO5 and CUDO8 were found to possess all core virulence-associated genes involved in acute and chronic leptospirosis infection (Fig.\u00a04) (Additional file 1: Table S7).\n\nFig. 4\nThe distribution and conservation of 33 representative confirmed virulence genes in pathogenic, intermediate and non-pathogenic Leptospira species. Genes encoding for outer membrane protein (loa22), flagella motor switch protein (fliY), and hemolysins B and C (tlyB and tlyC) were conserved in all 24 Leptospira strains. Genes encoding was conserved only in pathogenic Leptospira strains. Strains CUDO5 and CUDO8 contained all of the 33 virulence genes\nFor phylogenomic analysis of L. interrogans strains, a total of 87,442 concatenated core-SNPs from the 97 genomes (Additional file 3: Table S2) were used to generate a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree with the GTR nucleotide substitution model. All strains were obtained from different geographical regions and hosts. The phylogenetic tree revealed two defining features: serovar specific branches, and a connectivity of human and animal isolates. Some serovars were clustered in the same clades, with bootstrap percentage of more than 75 supported, including serovar Australis (strains 200,703,203, SU5 and LT2148), serovar Grippotyphosa (strains Andaman, 2006006986, UI08368 and LT2186), serovar Hardjo (strains Prajitno, OV5 and Norma), serovar Pomona (strains UT364, GR5, AKRFB, Pomona and CSL 4002), and serovar Pyrogenes (strains 200701872, R168, L0374 and Sri Lanka 30). These strains came from different geographical locations. Notably, an intermingling of human and animal isolates was identified, particularly in the cluster of serovar Australis (human and pig), Hardjo (human and cattle), Pomona (human, pig and cattle) and Pyrogenes (human and rodent). L. interrogans serovar Paidjan strain CUDO5 and serovar Dadas strain CUDO8 were grouped in the same branch, with a bootstrap percentage of 100. Moreover, strains CUDO5 (serovar Paidjan) and CUDO8 (serovar Dadas) isolated from the urine of asymptomatic dogs were clustered on the evolutionary tree with leptospiral isolates recovered from humans in Thailand and China (Fig.\u00a05).\n\nFig. 5\nWhole genome core-single nucleotide polymorphisms (core-SNPs) phylogeny of L. interrogans based on the maximum likelihood method with 1000 bootstrap replicates. The core-SNPs phylogenomic analyses was visualized by EvolView [63]. The tree shows that L. interrogans serovar Paidjan strain CUDO5 and serovar Dadas strain CUDO8 were placed in the same branch with a bootstrap percentage of 100 as highlight in peach color. Serovar specific clades with bootstrap percentage of more than of 75 are highlight in blue color, including serovar Australis, Grippotyphosa, Hardjo, Pomona and Pyrogenes. L. kirscheneri serovar Cynopteri strain 3522 CT (CYN) was used as an outgroup in this study\nUsing the power fit law equation, it was calculated that b\u2009=\u20090.167923, and the expected size of the L. interrogans pan-genome was 7782 gene families. The pan-genomes tended to increase after each new genome addition (Fig.\u00a06a), and were assumed to be open in this analysis (n\u2009=\u200997). In contrast, the core-genome gradually decreased and became constant after 80 genomes were analyzed (Fig. 6a).\n\nFig. 6\nPan-genome analysis of L. interrogans (n\u00a0=\u200997) using the BPGA pipeline. The power and exponential law equations were used to create pan- and core-genome curves of L. interrogans (panel a). The COG categories distribution of core, accessory and strain-specific genes in 97\u2009L. interrogans strains are shown in panel b, and according to Heap\u2019s law the Leptospira genome was predicted to be open. The COG categories are denoted as follows: D (Cell cycle control, cell division, chromosome partitioning), M (Cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis), N (Cell motility), O (Posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones), T (Signal transduction mechanisms), U (Intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport), V (Defense mechanisms), J (Translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis), K (Transcription), L (Replication, recombination and repair), C (Energy production and conversion), G (Carbohydrate transport and metabolism), E (Amino acid transport and metabolism), F (Nucleotide transport and metabolism), H (Coenzyme transport and metabolism), I (Lipid transport and metabolism), Q (Secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism), P (Inorganic ion transport and metabolism), R (General function prediction only), and S (Function unknown)\nAccording to GET_HOMOLOGUES, a total of 2721 single-copy orthologous genes were shared among the 13 representative L. interrogans strains, and these were defined as core genes. After eliminating incomplete sequences due to frameshift mutations, insertions and deletions, 2408 protein-coding sequences were left. Of these, 56.36% of the encoded proteins had known function and the rest were hypothetical proteins. This study focused only on proteins of known function. Based on the LRT statistic for the site-model, 352 genes were under significant positive selection (FDR\u2009<\u20095%). Genes under positive selection were further identified based on functional classification and on whether they encoded known virulence factors, using the COG and VFDB categories respectively. In relation to functional classification, COG classified protein-coding genes involved with category M (cell wall/envelope biosynthesis), E (amino acid transport), H (coenzyme transport and metabolism), T (signal transduction mechanism) and J (Translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis) were significantly over-represented among the genes showing evidence of positive selection (P\u2009<\u20090.05, one-side binomial test) (Additional file 4: Table S1). Of these genes under positive selection, 101 were predicted as encoding putative virulence factors. Most of the genes in the three groups adhesion, anti-phagocytosis and iron uptake system were significantly over-represented (P\u2009<\u20090.05, one-side binomial test) (Additional file 4: Table S2). Moreover, another 74 genes showed evidence for positive selection and recombination (Additional file 4: Tables S3 and S4, Additional file 5: Figure S1). Interestingly, colA encoding for collagenase was identified amongst these, and this had an amino acid sequence homology of 29.19% to the enzyme in Clostridium perfringens. Positional mapping of 101 predicted virulence genes under positive selection is shown in Fig.\u00a07, and a summary of statistical analyses relating to positive selection for 18 representative virulence genes related to adhesion, anti-phagocytosis, iron uptake system, LPS biosynthesis, exotoxin and motility of L. interrogans is presented in Table\u00a02.\n\nFig. 7\nCircular genome map of L. interrogans serovar Lai strain 56601 and the other 13 representative strains studied, with the location of 101 predicted virulence genes under positive selection marked. Comparative sequence analysis was performed with BRIG [76] using L. interrogans strain 56601 as a reference (thick black innermost ring) against other representative related L. interrogans strains. The second inner ring indicates GC contents (black color) followed by the GC skew (purple and green colors). Each colored ring shows the host origin in each strain of chromosomal DNA of Leptospira presented as follows: magenta for dogs, blue for pigs, cyan for cattle and light-green for humans. The outermost labels show the location of 101 predicted virulence genes under positive selection in L. interrogans. The intensity of the ring color represents the percentage of nucleotide identity from 50 to 90\nTable 2\nStatistical summary of 18 virulence-associated genes under positive selection in 13 representative L. interorgan strains\n\naThe abbreviations for COG categories are defined as: M (Cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis), P (Inorganic ion transport and metabolism), J (Translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis) and N (Cell motility)\nb\u03c9 is the ratio of dN/dS under positive selection (model M2a)\nC2\u0394\u2113 is likelihood ratio test (LRT) statistic\ndtlyA is not found in VFDB database but this gene has been shown to be a virulence factor in pathogenic Leptospira [24]\neAll substitutions of flhB are non-synonymous and dS\u2009=\u20090; therefore the \u03c9 value is undefined and represented as 999 in the table. According to CODEML developer, LRT is not affected by dS in this analysis as shown by a significant q-value result\nThe results from the BEB analysis revealed that three amino acids in L. interrogans TlyA (amino acid positions 40, 43 and 258), two in HbpA (positions 240 and 395), 11 in FliN2 (positions 54, 58, 63, 65, 67, 68, 69, 70, 72, 74 and 75) and one in LpxD1 (position 47) were subjected to positive selection with a high posterior probability (PP\u2009>\u20090.95). According to the protein tertiary mapping by PyMOL, positive selection of TlyA occurred in the loop connecting two \u03b1-helices and the end of the C-terminus (Fig.\u00a08a), whereas for HbpA, positive selection was present in the loop connecting two \u03b2-pleated sheets (Fig. 8b). In FliN2, positive selection occurred in the loop linking two \u03b1-helices (Fig. 8c), while for LpxD1 positive selection was detected within a \u03b2-plated strand (Fig. 8d). Moreover, at more than 90% confidence, Phyre2 modeled L. interrogans TlyA as sharing 37% amino acid identity with a putative hemolysin of Streptococcus thermophiles; FliN2 had 44% amino acid identity to a flagella motor switch protein homolog in Salmonella Typhimurium; HbpA shared 14% amino acid identity with a ferripyoverdine receptor in Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and LpxD1 shared 26% amino acid identity with UDP-3-O-(3-hydroxymyristoryl) glucosamine N-acyltransferase in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The Phyre2 investigator tool showed that none of the amino acid residues under positive selection in TlyA, HbpA, FliN2 or LpxD1 occurred in the pocket sites.\n\nFig. 8\nThree-dimensional protein models of Hemolysin A (encoded by tlyA: panel a), Ton-B hemin binding receptor (encoded by hbpA: panel b), Flagella motor switch protein (encoded by fliN2: panel c), and UDP-3-O-(3-hydroxymyristoryl) glucosamine N-acyltransferase (encoded by lpxD1: panel d) under positive selection in L. interrogans.

The goal of the current work was to compare the patterns of gene expression and the genetic determinism of IMF traits in the porcine gluteus medius (GM) and longissimus dorsi (LD) muscles.A comparative analysis of the mRNA expression profiles of the pig GM and LD muscles in 16 Duroc pigs with available microarray mRNA expression measurements revealed the existence of 106 differentially expressed probes (fold-change >\u20091.5 and q-value <\u20090.05). Amongst the genes displaying the most significant differential expression, several loci belonging to the Hox transcription factor family were either upregulated (HOXA9, HOXA10, HOXB6, HOXB7 and TBX1) or downregulated (ARX) in the GM muscle. Differences in the expression of genes with key roles in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism (e.g. FABP3, ORMDL1 and SLC37A1) were also detected. By performing a GWAS for IMF content and composition traits recorded in the LD and GM muscles of 350 Duroc pigs, we identified the existence of one region on SSC14 (110\u2013114\u2009Mb) displaying significant associations with C18:0, C18:1(n-7), saturated and unsaturated fatty acid contents in both GM and LD muscles. Moreover, we detected several genome-wide significant associations that were not consistently found in both muscles. Further studies should be performed to confirm whether these associations are muscle-specific. Finally, the performance of an eQTL scan for 74 genes, located within GM QTL regions and with available microarray measurements of gene expression, made possible to identify 14 cis-eQTL regulating the expression of 14 loci, and six of them were confirmed by RNA-Seq.We have detected significant differences in the mRNA expression patterns of the porcine LD and GM muscles, evidencing that the transcriptomic profile of the skeletal muscle tissue is affected by anatomical, metabolic and functional factors. A highly significant association with IMF composition on SSC14 was replicated in both muscles, highlighting the existence of a common genetic determinism, but we also observed the existence of a few associations whose magnitude and significance varied between LD and GM muscles.Intramuscular fat (IMF) content and fatty acids (FA) composition have important effects on the oxidative stability, tenderness and juiciness of pig meat [1]. These phenotypes are moderately heritable and, in consequence, they can be improved through artificial selection [2]. Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been carried out in pigs to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) influencing IMF content and composition traits [3\u201312]. Population sizes employed in these studies have oscillated between 138 [12] and 2326 [11] individuals. Indeed, IMF content and composition traits are not routinely recorded by the pig breeding industry despite their strong impact on the manufacturing of cured products because they are difficult and expensive to measure. All these studies have investigated the genomic architecture of IMF traits in a single muscle, so we do not know yet whether the genetic determinism of IMF content and composition is shared across muscles. In a number of GWAS for IMF phenotypes, genome scans for expression QTL (eQTL) have been carried out as a strategy to pinpoint potential causal mutations. Hundreds of eQTL associated with muscle gene expression phenotypes have been identified, and several of them have been shown to co-localize with QTL for traits of economic interest [8, 13\u201320].In a previous study, we determined the IMF content and composition of two muscles, longissimus dorsi (LD) and gluteus medius (GM), in a commercial population of 350 Duroc pigs [21]. Phenotypic correlations between FA traits in these two muscles displayed moderate values ranging from rP\u2009=\u20090.28 to 0.58 [21]. These results suggested the existence of potential differences in the genetic determinism of FA composition across muscles. The goal of the current work was to investigate whether differences exist in the mRNA expression profiles of the GM and LD muscles. Moreover, we aimed to identify QTL for IMF content and composition traits in the GM and LD muscles of Duroc pigs and to establish their positional concordance.Paralleling the results in the GWAS analysis, the two SNPs in the SLC38A1 and SLC38A4 genes showed significant associations with C16:0 in the GM muscle but not in LD (Table 3). Regarding the two SNPs in the UVRAG gene, they showed significant associations with C14:0 in both muscles (Table 3). Finally, polymorphisms in the KCNIP2, BLOC1S2 and SCD genes displayed significant associations with C18:0 (q-value <\u20090.005) and SFA (q-value <\u20090.05) in both muscles, a result that, once again, confirms part of the associations detected in the GWAS (Table 3). The polymorphism of the SCD and BLOC1S2 genes was also associated with UFA content in the GM and LD muscles (Table 3).We have also investigated whether genes located within QTL regions are DE when comparing the mRNA expression profiles of the LD and GM muscles. If a threshold based on |FC|\u2009>\u20091.5 and q-value <\u20090.05 is considered, the only locus showing differential expression is the 5\u2032-nucleotidase, cytosolic II (NT5C2) gene, which maps to SSC14 (114\u2009Mb). If we consider a lowered significance threshold (|FC|\u2009>\u20091.2 and q-value\u2009=\u20090.05), then six additional genes display DE between GM and LD (Additional\u00a0file\u00a05).With the aim of confirming the existence of these cis-eQTL, we have used a previously published RNA-Seq data set comprising 52 of the 103 pigs analysed with microarrays [23]. As shown in Additional file 3, six cis-eQTL regulating the expression of six genes (ANXA8, BLOC1S2, COX15, GGCT, LGALS8 and FBXW4) showed significant differences across at least 2 genotypes when mRNA expression means measured with both microarrays and RNA-Seq were compared with a Student\u2019s t-test. Moreover, both microarray and RNA-Seq methods were consistent with regard to the direction of the changes observed when comparing genotypes (Additional file 3).The absence of an eQTL regulating SCD mRNA expression was unexpected because there are evidences that the rs80912566 (g.2228T\u2009>\u2009C) SNP is associated with the expression of this gene [24]. In Additional file 3, we have compared the GM SCD mRNA levels, measured with microarrays in TT, TC and CC pigs. Although TC individuals display a higher SCD mRNA expression than the CC and TT ones, differences are not statistically significant. A similar pattern was found when SCD mRNA expression was measured by RNA-seq (Additional file 3). We also analysed the correlation between the expression of the genes regulated by cis-eQTL and the phenotypes determined by the QTL to which they map to (Additional\u00a0file\u00a06). We found that the expression of the TAF5 gene is significantly correlated with C20:3 and saturated and unsaturated FA contents.To the best of our knowledge, no report has been published so far comparing the transcriptomic profiles of two different muscles in pigs. Our differential expression analysis revealed that several loci encoding HOX homeodomain transcription factors (HOXA9, HOXA10, HOXB6, HOXB7, ARX and TBX1) are DE between the LD and GM muscles. These transcription factors have a well-known role in morphogenesis of developing embryos and, in adult vertebrates, they are involved in a plethora of functions related to cell division and muscle contractility [25]. Similarly, the comparison of the transcriptomic profiles of gastrocnemius and quadriceps muscles in mouse revealed that several genes involved in embryogenesis (i.e. DKK3, HOXD8, HOXD9 and TBX1) are DE between these two muscles [26]. Moreover, Armstrong et al. [27] compared the expression profiles of nine lamb muscles by RNA-Seq and detected significant gene expression differences in almost all pairwise comparisons. Interestingly, the comparison of semitendinosus vs. supraspinatus mRNA levels showed that HOXD8 and HOXC10 genes are DE in these two muscles. Conceivably, HOX homeodomain transcription factors might play a critical role in the adult skeletal muscle of mice, sheep and pigs by controlling cell identity and differentiation of muscle fiber types.The microarray analysis of gene expression also revealed that several genes related to the metabolism of glucose and lipids are DE between GM and LD muscles (Additional file 1 and Additional file 2). Consistently, Armstrong et al. [27] compared the transcriptomic profiles of the semitendinosus, semimembranosus and longissimus lumborum muscles vs. suspraspinatus and evidenced that carbohydrate metabolism pathways are enriched in the sets of DE genes. According to our results (Additional file 1), the fatty acid binding protein 3 (FABP3) mRNA, which encodes a molecule binding and transporting FA towards specific cell compartments [28], is overexpressed in the GM muscle. This finding is significant because it is known that fatty acid binding protein content in most cells is generally proportional to the rates of FA metabolism [28]. Moreover, a polymorphism of the porcine FABP3 gene has been associated with IMF content and other lipid traits (reviewed in [3, 29]). Two other relevant genes that are downregulated in the GM muscle are the Nemo-like protein kinase (NLK), whose variation has been also associated with IMF content in pigs [30], and the nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group F member 1 (NR2F1) locus, an inhibitor of lipoprotein assembly in intestinal cells [31]. The protein kinase AMP-activated non-catalytic subunit \u00df2 (PRKAB2) gene, which was also downregulated in GM, encodes a subunit of the AMP-activated protein kinase, an enzyme that increases the rate of \u00df-oxidation of FA in the skeletal muscle [32]. With regard to the glucose metabolism, the solute carrier family 37 member 1 (SLC37A1) gene, which is overexpressed in GM, encodes a glucose-6-phosphate antiporter [33]. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase uses glucose-6-phosphate as a substrate to generate NADPH that can be used in FA biosynthesis [34]. These patterns of differential expression reflect differences in the lipid metabolism of LD and GM, a feature that could explain, at least in part, the higher IMF content of the GM (Additional\u00a0file\u00a07). Noteworthy, Morales et al. [35] observed differences in the activity of two lipogenic enzymes when comparing the GM and the semimembranosus muscles in a sample of Iberian and Landrace pigs.When backfat was used as a covariate to perform the GWAS for IMF content, we did not detect any significant association. In contrast, when we excluded this covariate from the statistical analysis, we found significant associations with IMF content in the GM (1 significant SNP) and LD (4 significant SNPs) muscles in a SSC6 region (146.5\u2013147.7\u2009Mb) which contains the leptin receptor gene (LEPR). Such association agrees well with previous studies showing that the polymorphism of the LEPR gene is associated with IMF content in Korean native \u00d7 Yorkshire [36], Landrace \u00d7 Iberian [37], Duroc \u00d7 Iberian [38] and Duroc [12] pigs. The binding of leptin, a hormone secreted by the adipose tissue, to its receptor regulates satiety, body weight and the energy balance [39], so it could have potential effects on muscle fat deposition. Indeed, Ros-Freixedes and coworkers showed that the LEPR c.1987C\u2009>\u2009T SNP is associated with plasma leptin concentration, backfat thickness and IMF content in 853 Duroc pigs, suggesting the causal effects of this gene on fat deposition [12].The SSC14 region comprised between 110.9\u2013114.5\u2009Mb encompassed most of the associations observed in our study (Table 2, Fig. 2). In both muscles, marker effect sizes were negative for C18:0 and SFA and positive for C18:1 (n-7) and UFA, suggesting the existence of one causal mutation with opposed effects on both phenotypes or of at least two causal mutations with different effects on these phenotypes. This region had been identified in previous GWAS as associated with IMF composition. Yang et al. [7] carried out a GWAS for FA composition phenotypes and detected associations between SNPs on SSC14 (121\u2009Mb, assembly version Sscrofa10.2) and LD C18:0 content in Sutai \u00d7 (White Duroc \u00d7 Erhualian) F2 pigs, whilst Zhang et al. [11] reported associations of this region with the C18:1(n-9)/C18:0 ratio in a related pig population. The same region was reported by Zhang et al. [10] and Sato et al. [4] as associated with LD C18:0 in Duroc \u00d7 (Landrace \u00d7 Yorkshire) crossbred pigs and in Duroc pigs, respectively. Consistently, Ros-Freixedes et al. [12] described that the SSC14 (110\u2013114\u2009Mb, assembly version Sscrofa11.1) region is associated with GM and LD C18:1, SFA, monounsaturated FA (MUFA) and the C18:1/C18:0 ratio, whereas Van Son et al. [5] indicated that this very same region displays associations with C16:0, C16:1, C18:0, C18:1(n-9), SFA and MUFA contents in subcutaneous fat. Altogether, these results support the existence of one or several genetic determinants on SSC14 (110.9\u2013114.5\u2009Mb) with multiple effects on muscle FA composition. Interestingly, the annotation of the QTL regions revealed that the SSC14 (110.9\u2013114.5\u2009Mb) region contains, in addition to 33 protein-coding genes, three microRNAs (ssc-miR-436, ssc-miR-146b and ssc-miR-1307) and 4 lincRNA genes (Additional file 4). Studies performed in humans indicate that miR-146b inhibits the proliferation of visceral preadipocytes and stimulates their differentiation [40], while the functions of the lincRNAs are mostly unknown.In the analysis of candidate genes (Table 3), we have observed that SNPs mapping to the KCNIP2 (rs320607389, SSC14: 112.86\u2009Mb) and BLOC1S2 (rs335981556, SSC14: 111.39\u2009Mb) genes show significant associations with LD and GM C18:0 contents. However, the most obvious candidate locus to explain the associations detected in the SSC14 (110.9\u2013114.5\u2009Mb) region is the SCD gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in the desaturation of FA. Our results show the existence of significant associations between SNPs mapping to the SCD gene and GM and LD C18:0 and SFA (Table 3). Previously, Estany et al. [24] reported that the g.2228\u2009T\u2009>\u2009C SNP (rs80912566) located in the 5\u2019end of the porcine SCD gene is additively associated with the desaturation C18:1/C18:0 ratio in both muscle and subcutaneous fat in Duroc pigs, a result that would be consistent with ours. In a recent study, Fern\u00e1ndez et al. [41] analysed the association of the SCD genotype and IMF composition in three (Iberian \u00d7 Landrace)\u2009\u00d7\u2009Landrace, (Iberian \u00d7 Duroc)\u2009\u00d7\u2009Duroc and (Iberian \u00d7 Pi\u00e9train)\u2009\u00d7\u2009Pi\u00e9train backcrosses. These authors showed that the g.2228\u2009T\u2009>\u2009C (rs80912566) SNP in the 5\u2019end of the SCD gene is associated with LD C18:0 (P-value\u2009=\u20090.001) and SFA (P-value\u2009=\u20095.7\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2212\u20093) contents but not with C18:1(n-9) content (P-value\u2009=\u20090.207) in the Duroc backcross. A similar outcome was obtained in the Pi\u00e9train backcross, highlighting the consistency of such results. In the GWAS carried out in the current work, the ALGA0081091 SNP, which shows the most significant associations with GM and LD C18:0 and C18:1(n-7), is located on SSC14:111,483,985\u2009bp while the SCD g.2228\u2009T\u2009>\u2009C SNP (rs80912566) maps to 14: 111,461,751\u2009bp. In other words, there are ~\u200922\u2009kb between both markers. Sato et al. [4] and Van Son et al. [5] also reported that the SSC14 (120\u2013124\u2009Mb, assembly version Sscrofa10.2, 110\u2013114\u2009Mb in the Sscrofa11.1 assembly) SNPs displaying the most significant associations with FA composition are located ~\u200922\u2009kb and 280,389\u2009kb away from the SCD g.2228\u2009T\u2009>\u2009C SNP, respectively, suggesting that SCD g.2228\u2009T\u2009>\u2009C is linked to a yet to be found causal mutation with pleiotropic effects on FA traits.The analysis of eQTL for 74 genes mapping to the SSC14 (110.9\u2013114.5\u2009Mb) QTL did not reveal any genetic determinant regulating SCD mRNA expression (Table 4). We also investigated differences in SCD mRNA expression amongst pigs with different g.2228\u2009T\u2009>\u2009C SNP SCD genotypes (Additional file 3) and we did not find significant differences. Fern\u00e1ndez et al. [41] compared the expression of the SCD mRNA in (Iberian \u00d7 Duroc)\u2009\u00d7\u2009Duroc pigs with different haplotypes and found that individuals homozygous for the H1 SCD haplotype (which comprises the TT genotype) had a higher SCD mRNA expression in the LD muscle when compared with swine with other haplotypes, but differences were not statistically significant. Similar results were obtained by the same authors when analyzing SCD mRNA expression in (Iberian \u00d7 Pi\u00e9train)\u2009\u00d7\u2009Pi\u00e9train pigs [41]. The g.2228\u2009T\u2009>\u2009C SNP maps to the 5\u2019UTR of the SCD gene, so it might have effects on the stability or the translatability of the transcript, but this needs to be confirmed with a functional assay.By combining microarray and RNA-Seq data, we obtained evidence of eQTL regulating the expression of the BLOC1S2 gene which maps to the SSC14 (110.9\u2013114.5\u2009Mb) QTL (Table 4). The BLOC1S2 gene encodes a protein that forms part of the BLOC-1 complex, which is involved in the biogenesis and maturation of lysosomes and endosomes [42]. There are increasing evidences that lysosomes have a key role in the processing and sorting of exogenous and endogenous lipids [43]. Another gene of interest is COX15, which is involved in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase, the terminal component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain [44]. The expression of these two genes did not significantly correlate with the phenotypic variation of C18:0, C18:1 (n-7), SFA or MUFA (Additional file 6). This could be due to the fact that the co-localizations detected by us do not have any functional meaning or, more likely, to the complex genomic architecture of these traits, which are determined by the action of multiple genes. On the other hand, there are many examples of genes whose expression levels do not directly correlate with protein levels and even less with protein activity levels. Therefore, although eQTL are an excellent starting point to detect sequence variability associated with gene activity, it is critical to assess also the potential consequences of regulatory polymorphisms with functional assays.We have also identified several genomic regions i.e. SSC2 (10.6\u201311.7\u2009Mb), SSC2 (21.9\u201322.3\u2009Mb), SSC5 (76.2\u201377.1\u2009Mb), SSC9 (10.4\u201313.2\u2009Mb) and SSC18 (39.4\u201342.3\u2009Mb) displaying genome-wide significant associations with LD C17:0, LD C16:1(n-9), GM C16:0, LD C14:0 and GM C20:3(n-3), respectively (Table 2 and Figs. 3 and 4). Amongst these, only the QTL for GM C16:0 on SSC5 and the QTL for GM C20:3(n-3) on SSC18 displayed effect sizes clearly different from zero (Table 2).The association between SSC9 (10.4\u201313.2\u2009Mb) and LD C14:0 has been consistently reported in the scientific literature. Sato et al. [4] and Zhang et al. [10] also described associations between SNPs comprised within this region and LD C14:0 content recorded in Duroc swine and Duroc \u00d7 (Landrace \u00d7 Yorkshire) crossbred pigs, respectively. Moreover, Zhang et al. [11] showed that this SSC9 region is associated with the C16:1(n-7)/C14:0 ratio in Duroc \u00d7 (Landrace \u00d7 Yorkshire) swine. On the other hand, genomic regions on SSC2 (10.6\u201311.7\u2009Mb) and SSC5 (76.2\u201377.1\u2009Mb) have been also associated with FA traits in Erhualian and in a meta-analysis comprising five pigs populations, but such associations differ from the ones reported by us with regard to the involved phenotype [11].Our GWAS should have enough power to detect associations produced by SNPs with moderate to large effects, while SNPs with small effects would be undetectable (Additional file 3). In a similar study based on 331 pigs and a significance threshold of 1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2212\u20096, Zhang et al. [45] showed that the power to detect a QTL that explained 5% of the phenotypic variation was \u224823.6%, but it increased to 90% when the QTL explained 10% of the variance. In another study based on half-sib families of 60 individuals and a population size of 500 individuals, Teyss\u00e8dre et al. [46] showed that, when assuming h2\u2009=\u20090.3\u20130.6, QTL explaining 4% of the variance of FA traits could be detected with a power of 80%. In the light of these results and ours, it is reasonable to infer that QTL with modest to large effects can be detected with a population of 300\u2013400 pigs, while the majority of QTL with small effects would be missed.The detection of different associations for traits recorded in the GM and LD muscles might be due to technical and biological factors. The size of the Duroc population analysed in the current work is modest and the precise quantification of QTL for minority FA can be challenging. Both factors might increase the rate of false negatives (type 2 error), thus generating spurious muscle-specific associations. We aimed to take a further look at this issue by genotyping a panel of selected SNPs mapping to QTL regions and investigating their associations with FA traits in the LD and GM muscles. The genotyping of the rs341329842 (SS5: 77.0\u2009Mb) and rs333018168 (SSC5: 77.4\u2009Mb) SNPs mapping to the SLC38A1 and SLC38A4 genes confirmed that they are associated with C16:0 in the GM but not in the LD muscle (Table 2). These two genes are involved in the transportation of glutamine [47], an amino acid that can be used as a substrate for lipogenesis [48], so it would be worth to further explore their role on the genetic determinism of FA composition. We also typed two SNPs, rs321243508 (SSC9:10.3\u2009Mb) and rs328455999 (SSC9:11.3\u2009Mb), which map to the UVRAG gene. This locus encodes a key regulator of autophagy [49], a biological process with an important impact on lipid storage [50]. The polymorphism of the UVRAG gene was associated with C14:0 in both muscles (Table 3), but the significance of such association was slightly higher for LD (q-value\u2009=\u20090.001) than for GM (q-value\u2009=\u20090.005). It is difficult to evaluate the relative impact of technical and biological factors on the lack of replication of several significant associations found either in LD or in GM. Carbonetto et al. [51] measured the weight of four hindlimb muscles in mice and, by using genotypes obtained with the high-density MegaMUGA SNP panel, they found that 18 and 15 genomic regions showed associations that were shared and non-shared across the four analysed muscles, respectively. In pigs, the existence of muscle-specific genomic associations with FA traits should be further investigated because such phenomenon may have practical implications in the framework of genomic selection schemes aimed to improve IMF composition traits.The comparison of the mRNA expression profiles of the LD and GM muscles has demonstrated the existence of significant differences in the mRNA expression of genes involved in the differentiation of muscle cells as well as in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. This differential expression might be caused by differences in the body location, function and metabolism of the two porcine muscles under study. Performance of a GWAS has revealed an association between a region on SSC14 (110.9\u2013114.5\u2009Mb) and FA composition that happened to be highly significant in both GM and LD muscles. This region also contained cis-eQTL for genes with potential connections with lipid metabolism. In contrast, several of the associations reported in our study were not consistently found in both muscles, a finding that could be due to technical (e.g. lack of power) and/or biological factors.Phenotypes were recorded in 350 barrows from a commercial Duroc line (Lipgen population) distributed in five half-sib families. After weaning, this pig population was transferred to the experimental test station at the Centre de Control Porc\u00ed of the Institut de Recerca i Tecnologia Agroaliment\u00e0ries (IRTA). A detailed description of the experimental population and management conditions can be found in Gallardo et al. [52, 53]. Pigs were slaughtered at around 190\u2009days of age (approximately 122\u2009kg of live weight) following a commercial protocol in compliance with Spanish welfare regulations. Samples (200\u2009g) of GM and LD muscles were taken immediately after slaughter to perform meat analyses at IRTA-Centre of Food Technology. A near infrared transmittance device (NIT, Infratec 1625, Tecator Hoganas, Sweden) was used to determine IMF content in the GM and LD muscles. The measurement of FA composition (C10 to C22 range) in the GM and LD muscles was achieved by gas chromatography of methyl esters [54]. A complete list of the IMF content and composition traits measured in the current experiment is shown in Additional file 7.For the current study, mRNA expression in the GM and LD muscles was analysed in 16 pigs chosen at random from the Lipgen population. This sample size should be sufficient to test if both muscles have similar or different transcriptomic profiles. Gluteus medius and LD muscle samples were collected from Duroc pigs at slaughter, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u2212\u200980\u2009\u00b0C. Both GM and LD mRNA expression profiles were characterized with the GeneChip Porcine Genome Array (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). All details about RNA isolation, microarray hybridisation and quality control of expression data are provided in C\u00e1novas et al. [55]. Microarray data describing GM and LD mRNA expression profiles were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) public repository (GEO accession numbers: GSE19275 and GSE25708). The GeneChip Porcine Genomic arrays (ThermoFisher Scientific, Barcelona, Spain) were also used to measure mRNA expression in GM samples from 103 Duroc pigs (the 16 samples mentioned before plus 87 additional samples) with the aim of performing an eQTL scan. Data pre-processing, background correction, normalization and log-transformation of expression values between samples were carried out by computing a Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) as described by Irizarry et al. [56]. Differential expression between muscles (GM vs. LD) was assessed by following the limma-trend pipeline recommendations [57, 58], where the limma\u2019s empirical Bayes procedure was modified to incorporate a mean-variance trend, modeling the relationship between variance and gene signal intensity. Fold-change (FC) values refer to mean expression levels in GM compared to LD.Probes showing a |FC|\u2009>\u20091.5 and q-value <\u20090.05 were considered to be differentially expressed (DE) in the GM vs. LD comparison. Probes showing a significant DE were then translated to gene equivalents by using the Affymetrix porcine annotation data (chip porcine) assembled database [59] and the Biomart database available at Ensembl repositories (https://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/). Pathway enrichment analysis and gene ontology annotations were performed upon the more stringent filtering of DE probes (|FC|\u2009>\u20091.5 and q-value <\u20090.05) using Panther Gene List Classification System (http://www.pantherdb.org).Whole-genome genotyping of the 350 Duroc pigs was performed using the Porcine SNP60 BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA) which contains probes for 62,163 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Filtering analyses based on the quality of the genotyping results were performed with the GenomeStudio software (Illumina). By using PLINK v. 1.07 [60], we filtered SNPs with minor allele frequencies below 5%, rates of missing genotypes above 10% or showing highly significant departures from the Hardy-Weinberg expectation (threshold set at a P-value of 0.001). The SNPs that did not map to the porcine reference genome (Sscrofa11.1 assembly) and those located in sexual chromosomes were also excluded from further analyses. After these filtering steps, a subset of 32,784 SNPs were used as markers in the genome-wide association study (GWAS).Additionally, 12 SNPs mapping to the solute carrier family 38 member 1 (SLC38A1, rs341329842) and member 4 (SLC38A4, rs333018168), UV radiation resistance associated (UVRAG, and rs328455999), biogenesis of lysosomal organelles complex 1 subunit 2 (BLOC1S2, rs335981556), potassium voltage-gated channel interacting protein 2 (KCNIP2, rs320607389) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD, rs335981556, rs698797651, rs323081995, rs80912566, rs342182479, rs45434498 and rs713641545) genes were genotyped in the Veterinary Service of Molecular Genetics (http://svgm.es/ca/Home) of the Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona by using a QuantStudio 12\u2009K Flex real-time PCR instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Primers are listed in Additional\u00a0file\u00a08. These SNPs were identified by taking into account the whole-genome sequencing of the five parental boars (our unpublished data) as well as by the RNA-Sequencing of 52 pigs selected from the population of 350 offspring individuals [23]. Polymorphisms were selected according to their co-localization with the QTL identified in the current work as well as by their potential effect on gene function (SNPs at splice sites or causing amino acid substitutions were prioritized). We also prioritized SNPs that were segregating in our resource Duroc population.Statistical methods employed in the current work have been previously reported by Gonz\u00e1lez-Prendes et al. [61]. In this way, mixed-model association analyses were carried out with the Genome-wide Efficient Mixed-Model Association (GEMMA) software, developed by Zhou and Stephens [62]. This method corrects population structure by considering the relatedness matrix, which is built by taking into account all genome-wide SNPs as a random effect. We used the following statistical model to estimate each SNP effect on IMF content and composition traits:where y is the vector of phenotypic values for all individuals; W is a matrix including a column of 1\u2009s, the incidence of fixed effects (batch of fattening, with 4 categories) plus a covariate that depends on the trait: (1) IMF content in GM (for FA traits measured in the GM muscle), (2) IMF content in LD (for FA traits measured in the LD muscle), (3) backfat thickness (for IMF content measured in GM and LD); \u03b1 is a vector of the corresponding fixed effects that includes the intercept, the batch effects and the regression coefficient on the covariate; x is a vector of marker genotypes in each individual; \u03b4 is the effect size of the marker (allele substitution effect); u is a vector of random individual genetic effects with a n-dimensional multivariate normal distribution u\u2009\u223c\u2009N (0, \u03bb \u03c4\u2212\u20091 K), being \u03c4\u2212\u20091 the variance of the residual error, \u03bb is the ratio between the two variance components and K a known relatedness matrix derived from SNP genotypes; and \u03b5 is the vector of errors. The statistical relevance of the systematic environmental sources of variation and the covariates were previously corroborated by Gallardo et al. [52] and Casellas et al. [63]. In this study, QTL were defined as those genomic regions containing at least 2 SNPs significantly associated with a given IMF content or composition trait. Correction for multiple testing was implemented with a false discovery rate (FDR) approach [64]. The gene-centric association analysis for the SLC38A1, SLC38A4, UVRAG, BLOC1S2, KCNIP2 and SCD loci was performed with GEMMA by using the same methods reported above. The power of the GWAS to detect associations in a population of 350 Duroc pigs was evaluated with the Genetic Power Calculator software [22]. We assumed equal allele frequencies between an unobserved causal variant and an observed genotype in our panel of SNPs under two different scenarios of linkage disequilibrium (r2\u2009=\u20090.6 and r2\u2009=\u20090.8). The type I error rate (\u03b1) was fixed to \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.00005 (equivalent to a q-value\u2009=\u20090.05 in our associations test). The effect size of the SNP (\u03b2) expressed in standard deviations (we assumed a normal distribution) and a minor allele frequency (MAF) equal to 0.35 were taken into account to calculate the variance explained by the causal variant in the population (q2\u2009=\u2009\u03b22*MAF).We performed a genome scan to identify potential cis-eQTL regulating the expression of 74 genes mapping to QTL determining IMF traits recorded in the GM muscle by using a previously reported methodology [61]. Gene expression phenotypes were determined with microarrays, as reported above. Official gene names and positions of each probe included in the GeneChip Porcine Genomic array (ThermoFisher, Barcelona, Spain) were identified in the BioMart database [65]. The statistical model assumed in the GEMMA analysis was the same reported in the previous section. However, the vector of fixed effects \u03b1 and its corresponding incidence matrix W included not only the batch of fattening (with 4 categories) but also a \u201claboratory\u201d fixed factor (two levels) because microarray data were generated in two different laboratories. Correction for multiple testing was implemented with the FDR approach mentioned above [64]. The threshold of significance in the analysis of cis-eQTL was established in accordance with previously reported criteria [61]. We considered that two QTL and eQTL co-localize when there is at least an overlap of 1 base pair between the genomic regions containing them. The set of cis-eQTL identified with the methods reported above were independently confirmed by using RNA-Seq data from 52 of the 103 pigs employed in the current experiment. The methods involved in the RNA-Seq experiment have been reported by Cardoso et al. [23].Additionally, we evaluated the effects of g.2228\u2009T\u2009>\u2009C SNP SCD genotypes over the SCD mRNA expression (measured with microarrays and RNA-Seq) with a linear model considering the batch and lab effects. The significance of mean differences between TT, TC and CC genotypes were assessed with a Student\u2019s t-test [66].Absolute value of the fold-changeBase pairDifferentially expressedFor exampleExpression QTLFatty acidsGenome-wide Efficient Mixed-Model AssociationGene Expression Omnibus\nGluteus medius\nGenome-wide association analysisIn other wordsIntramuscular fatKilobase pairs\nLongissimus dorsi\nLong intergenic noncoding RNAMegabase pairsMessenger RNAQuantitative trait lociPhenotypic correlationSingle nucleotide polymorphismPorcine chromosomeMarker effect size for traits measured in the gluteus medius muscleMarker effect size for traits measured in the longissimus dorsi musclePart of the research presented in this publication was funded by grants AGL2013\u201348742-C2\u20131-R and AGL2013\u201348742-C2\u20132-R awarded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and grant 2014 SGR 1528 from the Agency for Management of University and Research Grants of the Generalitat de Catalunya.

Amongst the genes displaying the most significant differential expression, several loci belonging to the Hox transcription factor family were either upregulated (HOXA9, HOXA10, HOXB6, HOXB7 and TBX1) or downregulated (ARX) in the GM muscle. Differences in the expression of genes with key roles in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism (e.g. FABP3, ORMDL1 and SLC37A1) were also detected. Indeed, the pathway analysis revealed that lipid and carbohydrate metabolic processes are enriched in the set of DE genes, although only at the nominal level (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02).Table 1\nList of the twenty genes displaying the highest differential expression between the gluteus medius and longissimus dorsi muscles (threshold of significance: |FC|\u2009>\u20091.5, q-value <\u20090.05) 1\n\n1Fold-change refers to mean expression levels in gluteus medius compared to longissimus dorsi; \u2212log10(P): decimal logarithm of the nominal P-value, \u2212log10(q): decimal logarithm of the q-value\n\n\nFig. 1\nVolcano plot of probes differentially expressed in the gluteus medius (GM) and longissimus dorsi (LD) muscles, along with fold changes (ratio between GM/LD mean expression values) for these probes (|FC|\u2009>\u20091.5, q-value <\u20090.05)\nPerformance of a GWAS revealed the existence of several QTL displaying genome-wide significant associations with IMF phenotypes (Table\u00a02 and Figs.\u00a02, 3 and 4). With regard to IMF content, we found a region on SSC6 (146.5\u2013147.7\u2009Mb) which showed a genome-wide significant association in the LD (\u2212log10P-value\u2009=\u20096.88, q-value\u2009=\u20090.0044, \u03b4\u00a0=\u2009\u2212\u20090.69\u2009\u00b1\u20090.13) and GM (\u2212log10P-value\u2009=\u20096.47, q-value\u2009=\u20090.01, \u03b4\u00a0=\u2009\u2212\u20090.84\u2009\u00b1\u20090.16) muscles only when backfat was removed as a covariate in the statistical analysis. When considering IMF composition, the largest number of associations were found in SSC14, where we observed the existence of one region located between 110 and 114\u2009Mb and displaying significant associations with C18:0, C18:1 (n-7), saturated and unsaturated FA contents both in the GM and the LD muscles (Fig.\u00a02). Effect sizes of markers were negative for C18:0 (\u03b4GM\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.63\u2009\u00b1\u20090.10, \u03b4LD\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.62\u2009\u00b1\u20090.10) and saturated FA\u00a0-\u00a0SFA (\u03b4GM\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.87\u2009\u00b1\u20090.18, \u03b4LD\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.95\u2009\u00b1\u20090.19) and positive for C18:1 (n-7) (\u03b4GM\u2009=\u20090.13\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03, \u03b4LD\u2009=\u20090.18\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03) and unsaturated FA - UFA (\u03b4GM\u2009=\u20090.87\u2009\u00b1\u20090.18, \u03b4LD\u2009=\u20090.94\u2009\u00b1\u20090.19). We also observed significant associations between GM C18:0 and three additional SSC14 regions on 54.6\u201355.3\u2009Mb, 60.6\u201362.9\u2009Mb and 81.1\u201387.7\u2009Mb. This latter region was also associated with LD SFA. Regarding C18:1(n-7) FA content in the LD muscle, two regions on SSC14 at 81.2\u201381.3\u2009Mb and 133.1\u2013136.7\u2009Mb were associated with this trait (Table 2, Fig. 2). Moreover, we identified several regions showing associations that were not consistently found in both muscles (Table 2 and Figs.\u00a03 and 4). Two QTL for C16:0 (SSC5: 76.2\u201377.1\u2009Mb) and C20:3 (n-3) (SSC18: 39.4\u201342.3\u2009Mb) were significant for the GM muscle but not for the LD one (Fig.\u00a03). Moreover, the effect size of the QTL for C16:0 on SSC5 (76.2\u201377.1\u2009Mb) was considerably high (\u03b4GM\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.87\u2009\u00b1\u20090.20). Conversely, three QTL for C14:0 (SSC9: 10.4\u201313.2\u2009Mb), C16:1 (n-9) (SSC2: 21.9\u201322.3\u2009Mb) and C17:0 (SSC2: 10.6\u201311.7\u2009Mb) were significant for the LD but not for the GM muscle (Fig.\u00a04, Table 2). However, the effects sizes of these three QTL were close to zero, so it is difficult to evaluate their relevance. A GWAS signal was observed for GM C14:0 on SSC9:10\u201313\u2009Mb, but it did not reach genome-wide significance (Fig. 4).Table 2\nGenome-wide significant QTL for intramuscular fat composition traits recorded in the gluteus medius (GM) and longissimus dorsi (LD) muscles of Duroc pigs1\n\n1SSC: porcine chromosome, N: Number of SNPs significantly associated with the trait under study, SNP: SNP displaying the most significant association with the trait under study, Region (Mb): region containing SNPs significantly associated with the trait under study, \u2212log10 (P): decimal logarithm of the nominal P-value, q-value: q-value calculated with a false discovery rate approach, B: Bonferroni corrected P-values, \u03b4: effect size of the marker and its standard error (SE), A1: minor allele, MAF: minor allele frequency\n\n\nFig. 2\nManhattan plots depicting the genome-wide significant associations between SNP markers and C18:0 and C18:1(n-7) fatty acid contents in the gluteus medius (GM) and longissimus dorsi (LD) muscles of Duroc pigs.

It can be seen that SNPs at SSC2 (C16:1 and C17:0) and SSC9 (C14:0) display significant associations with FA composition traits recorded in the LD muscle but not in the GM one\nThis apparent lack of concordance between the associations found in GM and LD might be due to technical reasons. For instance, the high stringency of the correction for multiple testing could increase the rate of false negatives. Limited statistical power may also lead to the occurrence of a high type 2 error rate, so we have estimated the power of our GWAS by using the procedure reported by Purcell et al. [22]. With a sample size of 350 pigs, we should be able to detect alleles with moderate to large effects (Additional\u00a0file\u00a03), while the majority of alleles with small effects would be missed. To confirm part of the associations found, we genotyped 12 SNPs mapping to six protein-coding genes i.e. SLC38A1 (SSC5: 77.0\u201377.0\u2009Mb), SLC38A4 (SSC5: 77.4\u201377.4\u2009Mb), UVRAG (SSC9: 10.0\u201310.3\u2009Mb), KCNIP2 (SSC14: 112.8\u2013112.8\u2009Mb), BLOC1S2 (SSC14: 111.3\u2013111.3\u2009Mb) and SCD (SSC14: 111.4\u2013111.4\u2009Mb) loci (Table\u00a03). Several microRNA and lincRNA genes map to QTL regions (Additional\u00a0file\u00a04), but their functions are mostly unknown so it is difficult to make biological inferences from these co-localizations.Table 3\nAssociation analyses between 12 polymorphisms in six candidate genes and intramuscular fat content and composition traits measured in the gluteus medius (GM) and longissimus dorsi (LD) muscles of Duroc pigs1\n\n1SSC: porcine chromosome, q-value: q-value calculated with a false discovery rate approach, \u03b4: effect size of the marker and its standard error (SE), A1: minor allele, MAF: minor allele frequency\nPerformance of an eQTL scan for 74 genes, located within the GM QTL regions (as defined in Table 2) and with available microarray measurements of gene expression, made possible to identify 14 cis-eQTL regulating the expression of 14 loci (Table\u00a04, Fig.\u00a05). As shown in Table 4, chromosome 14 encompassed most of these cis-eQTL, which regulated genes co-localizing with two GM C18:0 QTL at 54.6\u201355.3\u2009Mb (galectin 8, LGALS8 and lysosomal trafficking regulator, LYST) and 81.1\u201387.7\u2009Mb (annexin A8 gene, ANXA8).

As shown in Table 4, we have also identified cis-regulated genes mapping to a GM C20:3 (n-3) QTL on SSC18 (39.4\u201342.3\u2009Mb) i.e. FK506 binding protein 14, (FKBP14); \u0263-glutamylcyclotransferase (GGCT) and WAS/WASL interacting protein family member 3 (WIPF3).Table 4\nList of the co-localizations between QTL for IMF traits recorded in the gluteus medius (GM) muscle and cis-eQTL regulating the mRNA levels of genes expressed in the GM muscle and mapping to QTL regions1\n\n1SSC: porcine chromosome, N: number of SNPs significantly associated with the trait under study, SNP: SNP displaying the most significant association with the trait under study, Region (Mb): region containing SNPs significantly associated with the trait under study, \u2212log10(P): decimal logarithm of the nominal P-value, q-value: q-value calculated with a false discovery rate approach, B: Bonferroni-corrected P-value, \u03b4: effect size of the marker and its standard error (SE), A1: minor allele, MAF: minor allele frequency.\n\n\nFig. 5\nCo-localization of cis-eQTL (right panel) for the a LGALS8 and b KCNIP2 genes and two QTL regions (left panel) for gluteus medius (GM) C18:0 traits: a SSC14, 54.6\u201355.3\u2009Mb, b SSC14, 110\u2013114\u2009Mb.

In TNBC, immune-related pathways are typically upregulated and may be associated with a better prognosis of the disease, encouraging the pursuit for immunotherapeutic options. A number of immune-related molecules have already been associated to the onset and progression of breast cancer, including NOD1 and NOD2, innate immune receptors of bacterial-derived components which activate pro-inflammatory and survival pathways. In the context of TNBC, overexpression of either NOD1or NOD2 is shown to reduce cell proliferation and increase clonogenic potential\u00a0in vitro. To further investigate the pathways linking NOD1 and NOD2 signaling to tumorigenesis in TNBC, we undertook a global proteome profiling of TNBC-derived cells ectopically expressing each one of these NOD receptors.We have identified a total of 95 and 58 differentially regulated proteins in NOD1- and NOD2-overexpressing cells, respectively. We used bioinformatics analyses to identify enriched molecular signatures aiming to integrate the differentially regulated proteins into functional networks. These analyses suggest that overexpression of both NOD1 and NOD2 may disrupt immune-related pathways, particularly NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling cascades. Moreover, overexpression of either of these receptors may affect several stress response and protein degradation systems, such as autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome complex. Interestingly, the levels of several proteins associated to cellular adhesion and migration were also affected in these NOD-overexpressing cells.Our proteomic analyses shed new light on the molecular pathways that may be modulating tumorigenesis via NOD1 and NOD2 signaling in TNBC. Up- and downregulation of several proteins associated to inflammation and stress response pathways may promote activation of protein degradation systems, as well as modulate cell-cycle and cellular adhesion proteins. Altogether, these signals seem to be modulating cellular proliferation and migration via NF-\u03baB, PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways. Further investigation of altered proteins in these pathways may provide more insights on relevant targets, possibly enabling the immunomodulation of tumorigenesis in the aggressive TNBC phenotype.Breast cancer is the most common type of non-epidermal cancer in women, accounting for 25% of all female cancers diagnosed, being the leading cause of cancer mortality, representing 15% of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide [1, 2]. Social changes in lifestyle, reproductive and dietary habits are the main factors driving an increase in breast cancer incidence worldwide, particularly in developing countries [1]. Although early diagnosis through population-based screening and more effective treatment regimens have led to a decline in mortality rates (especially in more developed countries), some types of breast cancer still have very poor prognosis [3, 4], mostly due to the co-emergence of metastatic tumors [5].Traditionally, breast cancer classification is based on immunohistochemical detection of hallmark proteins associated with cell functions, including receptors for Estrogen (ER), Progesterone (PR) and amplification of HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2) [6]. Approximately 15% of all breast tumors derive from cells of basal origin (basal-like) and lack expression of ER, PR and amplification of HER2, being therefore classified as Triple Negative Breast Cancers (TNBC) [6\u20138]. TNBC has one of the poorest prognosis among all breast cancers, due to its aggressive clinical characteristics and, more specifically, lack of response to hormonal (ER and PR) or HER2 receptor-targeted drug therapy [7, 9].Several critical signaling pathways are deregulated during breast cancer progression [6], including immune-related cascades, which may promote tumorigenesis through chronic inflammation [10]. Immune-related genes and pathways are more highly expressed in TNBC than in other breast cancer subtypes [11], suggesting a stronger immunogenicity compared to non-TNBC. Moreover, overexpression of immune-related genes may be correlated with a better prognosis in TNBC [11], encouraging the pursuit of immunotherapeutic options for TNBC.A number of immune-related molecules have already been associated to the onset and progression of breast cancer, including interleukins, caspases and immune receptors, such as the NLRs (NACHT and Leucine Rich Repeat domain containing proteins) [12\u201314]. The NLRs recognize both pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), acting as innate immunity \u201csensors\u201d towards pathogen-derived components and cellular damage/stress [15]. Two major NLRs, namely, NOD1 and NOD2 (Nucleotide-Binding Oligomerization Domain-Containing Protein 1 and 2) directly bind to ligands through their variable tandem C-terminal Leucine-Rich Repeat domains (LRRs), which allow these receptors to detect the bacterial peptidoglycans (PGN) iE-DAP (gamma-D-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid) and MDP (muramyl dipeptide), respectively [16, 17]. In the cytosol, NOD1 and NOD2 are bound to the membranes of early endosomes and interact with the actin cytoskeleton, which helps to keep both receptors in an inactive state and enables receptor re-localization to sites of bacterial entry [18, 19]. After endocytosis [20, 21], PGNs are transported through the endosomal membrane by oligopeptide transporters SLC15A3, SLC15A4 or SLC46A2 [22\u201325], being promptly recognized by NOD1 and NOD2 receptors. Ligand-bound NOD1 and NOD2 self-oligomerize, using the endosomal membrane as a scaffold for the assembly of signaling complexes [23, 26], and recruits\u00a0RIPK2 (receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2). RIPK2 is then poly-ubiquitinated by E3 ligases, including TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) [27, 28], bringing together and activating members of the Inhibitory \u03baB Kinase (IKK) complex and TGF-\u03b2-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) [29]. TAK1 is a bifurcation point in NOD signaling, interacting with the IKK complex [30], which leads to NF-\u03baB activation through poly-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of its inhibitors (I\u03baBs) [31], and also binding to p38 and JNK [30, 32], thus activating stress kinase cascades through MAPKs [33].NOD1 and NOD2 receptors also respond to bacterial infections through an alternative pathway, independent of RIPK2 and NF-\u03baB signaling. During invasion by intracellular bacteria, NOD1 and NOD2 directly bind and recruit the critical autophagic protein ATG16L1 to the plasma membrane at the bacterial entry site, promoting highly specific segregation and degradation of bacteria by the autophagy machinery [34\u201337].In addition to their role as sensors of bacterial derivates, NOD1 and NOD2 receptors also monitor the intracellular environment, responding to perturbations in the actin cytoskeleton and to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress [38, 39]. ER stress elicits the unfolded protein response (UPR) system, which increases expression of chaperones and modifying enzymes needed to properly fold proteins and, ultimately, activates autophagy [40\u201342]. The UPR also promotes inflammation by recruiting Serine/threonine-protein kinase/endoribonuclease IRE1a, which leads to TRAF2-dependent activation of NOD1 and NOD2 and NF-\u03baB activation [38]. This pathway links ER stress to NF-\u03baB-driven inflammation, indicating not only a role for NOD1 and NOD2 in the intracellular surveillance, but also, allowing these receptors to respond to pathogens that do not produce specific PGNs [43].Based on the central role of NOD1 and NOD2 in these cellular surveillance pathways, these receptors have been proposed as tentative targets for immunomodulation of cancer. In fact, NOD1 and NOD2 have already been associated to increased risk of breast cancer [13, 14]. Also, NOD1 activation was shown to promote apoptosis and reduce estrogen-induced proliferative responses in the estrogen-dependent MCF7 breast cancer cell line [44]. Moreover, knockout of NOD1 in MCF7 cells leads to estrogen-dependent tumor growth in immune deficient mice [45], while its overexpression inhibits estrogen-dependent tumor proliferation in this model. Thus, it has been proposed that NOD1 may act as a tumor suppressor gene in ER-positive breast cancer cells [44, 45]. Furthermore, it has been previously shown that NOD1 and NOD2 have distinct expression patterns among different ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer cells [46]. To determine whether NOD1 and/or NOD2 play a similar tumor suppressor role in an ER-negative breast cancer cell, we decided to overexpress these receptors in the highly invasive TNBC-derived Hs578T cell line in order to evaluate their impact in breast tumorigenesis in vitro. Overexpression of either NOD1 or NOD2 reduces Hs578T cells proliferation and increases their clonogenic potential, suggesting that these receptors may affect tumorigenesis and invasion through ER-independent pathways in this TNBC model. Further investigation of the pathways underlying this phenotype is invaluable to direct future immunomodulatory therapies, especially given their high immunogenicity [11] and the lack of target-directed treatments for TNBCs. Therefore, in the present work, we have performed label-free LC-MS/MS proteome analyses of the NOD1- and NOD2-overexpressing Hs578T cells, integrating the differentially regulated proteins into functional networks to better understand their biological significance in the context of breast cancer progression.A total of 95 and 58 differentially regulated proteins from, respectively, HS578T/NOD1 and HS578T/NOD2, were subjected to a number of Bioinformatics analyses. To visualize the relationships and relative expression of these proteins, the log2-transformed intensity values for each of these three replicates (R) in each experimental group (P, NOD1 and NOD2) were subjected to Pearson\u2019s clustering in MORPHEUS [47]. Independent heatmaps for the HS578T/NOD1 (Fig. 2a) and HS578T/NOD2 (Fig. 2b), display clustering for both proteins (rows) and replicates for each group (columns). In general, both HS578T/NOD1 and HS578T/NOD2 groups exhibited a higher number of upregulated proteins and low concurrence of expression between the experimental groups. Additionally, many proteins sharing the same pathways or molecular functions were clustered in proximity. Also, replicates in all experimental groups clustered together, indicating low variability. The only exception was for a cluster of upregulated ribosome-associated proteins in the HS578T/NOD2 group in replicate 1, which deviated from the other replicates. However, statistical significance was still maintained.NOD1 and NOD2 are cytosolic immune receptors. Hence, the majority of their protein-protein interactions occur in the cytosol, following activation mediated by extracellular stimuli. The complex signal transduction is usually carried further into the nucleus, modulating the function of transcription factors. Therefore, assessing the subcellular localization of the up- and downregulated proteins in the NOD1 and NOD2 overexpressing populations, should allow deciphering the pathways which are being affected intracellularly. Two Bioinformatics tools were applied to investigate the subcellular localization of the 95 and 58 differentially regulated proteins in the HS578T/NOD1 and HS578T/NOD groups.Despite having most members localizing to the cytosol, the group of differentially regulated proteins in HS578T/NOD2 presented a higher number of membrane (e.g. SVIL and KCD12), nuclear (e.g. STAT6 and MBB1A) and even extracellularly (e.g. IGFBP-3 and PAI1) localized proteins in the network analysis (IPA\u00ae) (Fig. 3b), when compared to HS578T/NOD1 (Fig. 3a). This weighted analysis (EnrichR) supported association of these proteins to cellular structures in the cytosol (cytosolic large ribosomal subunit), membrane (focal adhesion) and nuclear (nucleolus) compartments (Fig. 3d).To further explore our proteomic data, an independent analysis was carried out using the GSEA software (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) [49, 50]. GSEA offers the advantage of a weighted analysis, based on raw MS/MS linear intensity values of all replicates, considering the entire dataset to determine whether molecular signatures (gene sets) show statistically significant differences between two experimental groups. Thus, GSEA may provide an unbiased analysis by our previous inclusion thresholds and statistical testing, which could be compared against our prior results. For the purposes of this analysis, we independently queried the Hallmarks, Reactome and KEGG databases, using the recommended 25% FDR (False Discovery Rate) as a cutoff (Additional file 2: Figure S2).GSEA revealed enrichment of several pathways in HS578T/NOD1, associated to major cellular processes, such as immune response cell cycle, cellular stress, proliferation and cell adhesion. Upregulated pathways with the highest normalized enrichment scores (NES; Additional file 2: Figure S2) were linked to proliferation, such as nucleotide metabolism (supported by proteins such as RIR2, UCK2 and DCK), G2/M checkpoint regulation (DPOA2, UCK2 and CKS1) and targets of E2F transcription factors (RIR2, SLD5 and RGAP1). Additionally, GSEA revealed enrichment of the DNA replication pathway, which includes several upregulated members of the MCM (mini-chromosome maintenance proteins) family of proteins (e.g. MCM2, MCM7 and MCM5), which are essential for initiation of eukaryotic genome replication and of the major tumor progression and cellular pathway regulated by the MYC proto-oncogene (e.g. IPO4, MPP10 and MRT4).Several stress-response pathways were also enriched in HS578T/NOD1. Upregulated proteins were associated to pathways such as: Reactive oxygen species (e.g. SRXN1, FRIL, SODC and TRXR1), Ultraviolet radiation response (e.g. SQSTM, DPOE3 and DNJA1) and mTORC1 signaling (e.g. AF1Q, SQSTM, SDF2L) pathways.Immune response pathways were also enriched in the NOD1 overexpressing cells, with proteins associated to NOD-like receptor signaling (e.g. SGT1, HS90A and NFKB1) and antigen processing and ubiquitination (e.g. UBE2C and UB2E2) pathways. Furthermore, as stress and inflammation signals often induce programmed cell death, Caspase-mediated apoptosis was also enriched in HS578T/NOD1, supported by upregulation of CASP3, CASP4 and SODC.Downregulated proteins in HS578T/NOD1 were also associated to immune and stress response, as well as to cellular adhesion and migration. Immune related proteins were associated to pathways such as: Interferon alpha response (e.g. RIPK2, B2MG and STAT2) and the natural killer cell cytotoxicity pathway (e.g. HLA class I histocompatibility antigens 1A02 and 1B51). Downregulated proteins were also associated to stress-related pathways such as: hypoxia (e.g. P4HA1, PFKAL and DPYL4) and ultraviolet response (CO1A2, RBPMS and ATX10) response systems.However, pathways with the highest NES were associated to cellular adhesion and migration, including NCAM signaling proteins (e.g. CO1A1, CO5A1 and SPTN1), extracellular matrix organization (e.g. CO1A2 and MMP14) and focal adhesion (KPCA, CO1A1 and MYLK).The gene set enrichment analysis for HS578T/NOD2 revealed mostly relevant upregulated pathways, linked to translation, immune response and tumor progression pathways. Upregulation of several RPL and RPS family members supported the enrichment of the ribosome pathway with the highest NES. Upregulation of additional proteins indicated enrichment of other pathways associated to translational regulation, including: Nonsense mediated decay (e.g. NCBP1, RS30 and IF4G1) and 3` UTR translational regulation (e.g. IF2B and IF4A2).Moreover, enrichment of the inflammatory response pathway was supported by upregulation of proteins such as: PAI1 and NFKB1. Finally, similarly to HS578T/NOD1, the pathway regulated by the MYC proto-oncogene was enriched in cells overexpressing NOD2, supported by upregulation of proteins such as: FAKD4 and GNL3.As expected, overexpression of NOD1 disrupted signaling pathways related to immune response and inflammation, some of which have been implicated in a variety of cancers [51\u201354]. Bioinformatics enrichment analysis revealed upregulation of proteins in the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, including several heat shock proteins and SGT1, which in turn interacts with HSP90 [55] and is essential for NOD1-mediated cytokine production and apoptosis in breast cancer cells [56]. Moreover, SGT1 is involved in kinetochore formation, being required for the G1/S and G2/M transitions [57\u201359], directly linking NOD-like signaling to cell proliferation control. Several upregulated heat shock proteins were identified as being part of the antigen processing and presentation pathway alongside 1B51 (HLA-B gene), a downregulated membrane-bound MHC class I molecule which plays a central role in the immune system by presenting peptides derived from the endoplasmic reticulum lumen [60]. Upon activation, HLA-B can signal to the NF-\u03baB complex via FRIL and PRDX1 (Fig. 3a) [61]. NF-\u03baB signaling is purportedly one of the most disrupted pathways in this model, as supported by the number of interactions in IPA radial network (Fig. 4a). The co-chaperone FKBP4, an HSP90 interactor, was also upregulated in HS578T/NOD1. FKBP4 participates in estrogen signaling by trafficking steroid hormone receptors between cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments [62] and regulates microtubule dynamics by inhibiting MAPT/TAU [63\u201366].The immune-related pathways enriched in HS578T/NOD1, which included several heat shock proteins, are closely related to stress response systems. Accordingly, a considerable number of stress associated pathways were found to be enriched in HS578T/NOD1, such as the Programmed cell death pathway, which includes a few Caspase molecules, and the Oxidative stress pathway, which includes SRXN1, SODC and FRIL, crosstalking with the HLA signaling pathway. Other apoptosis-associated proteins, such as TFIP8, a tumor suppressor that regulates TNF-mediated apoptosis via inhibition of caspase-8 [67] were also upregulated in HS578T/NOD1. Molecular pathways associated to hypoxia and UV radiation stress response were also disrupted in the NOD1 overexpressing cells, as indicated by upregulation of key regulatory proteins such as SQSTM.Hypoxia and UV radiation stress response pathways, which were disrupted in HS578T/NOD1, are known to activate stress-induced autophagy [68, 69]. Constitutive autophagy is an essential housekeeping process to maintain cellular homeostasis by targeting cytosolic components and organelles for degradation in the lysosome. However, autophagy is also highly responsive to stress [70], being activated through several stress response pathways which often employ heat shock, chaperone and co-chaperone proteins from the unfolded protein response (UPR) system. UPR is usually triggered by accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER stress) and, aside from being a potent trigger for autophagy, can also induce apoptosis through inflammatory pathways [68]. NOD1 and NOD2 were shown to be important mediators of this ER stress-induced inflammation, via NF-\u03baB signaling [39]. Also, NOD1 can directly interact with bacterial peptidoglycans in early endosomes to promote autophagy and inflammation, independently of the UPR system [23]. Moreover, both NOD1 and NOD2 can activate autophagy during bacterial infection by a mechanism which is independent of RIP2 and NF-\u03baB, by recruiting the autophagy protein ATG16L1 to the plasma membrane at the bacterial entry site [34, 35].Our analyses revealed that both the lysosome and autolysosome molecular signatures were enriched in HS578T/NOD1, suggesting stress-related disruption of the autophagy system. A key protein in this system, SQSTM, was upregulated, being associated to both stress response and autophagy enriched pathways. SQSTM is a highly selective cargo receptor protein [71], directly interacting with cytosolic targets for stress-induced autophagy degradation [72\u201375].SQSTM is also involved in the formation and autophagic degradation of cytoplasmic ubiquitin-containing inclusions [73, 74]. Enrichment of the Antigen processing and Ubiquitination pathway, supported by upregulation of several Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (e.g. UBE2C, UBE2K and UB2E2) indicates activation of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS) in HS578T/NOD1. Additionally, Ubiquitin was reported to bind both NOD1 and NOD2 to regulate inflammation and autophagy [76]. Furthermore, our protein interaction networks (Figs.\u00a03, 5a) pointed to UPS as one of the major interacting nodes, linking the function of vesicle-trafficking proteins, such as SC23B, SQSTM and FYCO1, to the NF\u03baB signaling pathway. Finally, upregulation of SQSTM, alongside other proteins, such as AF1Q (MLLT11), suggests activation of the mTORC1 complex, indicating yet another possible crosstalk between the Ubiquitin-Proteasome and autophagy systems [77].Autophagy has been described as a regulator of cell migration, modulating tumor cell motility, invasion and metastasis [78\u201380]. Overexpression of autophagy cargo receptors has been associated with the more aggressive mesenchymal subtype of primary glioblastoma, in which SQSTM was required for invasion and migration of stem-like cancer cells [78, 81, 82].Furthermore, during bacterial invasion, the inflammatory response promoted by NOD1 and NOD2 directly modulates the expression of adhesion molecules, such as E-Cadherin [83], ICAM1 [84] and VCAM1 [85]. Also, stimulation of NOD1 in epithelial cancer cells promotes specific pro-tumorigenic effects that include modulation of ICAM1 [53].These data suggest that overexpression of NOD1 and the enrichment of autophagy-related pathways and proteins such as SQSTM in HS578T/NOD1 may directly lead to modulation of adhesion and extracellular matrix organization pathways. Indeed, several molecular signatures related to migration and adhesion were altered in HS578T/NOD1, including Focal Adhesion, Epithelial-mesenchymal transition, NCAM signaling proteins and Extracellular matrix organization. Modulation of these pathways leading to an increase in migration and invasiveness in breast cancer cells [6], supports the phenotype of increased colony formation potential previously observed in HS578T/NOD1 [46].Upregulation of SQSTM and enrichment of the mTORC1 pathway in HS578T/NOD1 may directly modulate cellular proliferation, via the PI3K/Akt axis [86, 87]. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is often deregulated in cancers, modulating cell growth, apoptosis, malignant transformation, tumor progression and metastasis [6, 88, 89]. One of the proteins in the PI3K/Akt pathway, SCRIB, was downregulated in HS578T/NOD1. This tumor suppressor coordinates cell proliferation by regulating progression from G1 to S phase [90] and has also been reported as a positive regulator of apoptosis during acinar morphogenesis of the mammary epithelium [91]. Furthermore, SCRIB has a role in cell migration and adhesion, regulating cell invasion through MAPK signaling [92], also indicated by enrichment of the Stress-activated MAPK cascade pathway in Metascape.Other members of the mTORC1 complex may also impact NOD1-overxpressing cells proliferation, as, for example, RIR2, a pyrimidine catalytic subunit, which is present in the E2F transcription factor network. Upregulation of RIR2 in HS578T/NOD1 may also repress proliferation through inhibition of Wnt [93]. The Wnt pathway may be further repressed in these cells by downregulation of RTF1, a component of the PAF1 complex, required for transcription of Wnt target genes [94, 95]. Also, the nuclear cyclin-dependent kinase NUCKS was found to be downregulated in HS578T/NOD1. This cell-cycle protein was implicated in tumorigenesis, progression and poor prognosis of several human malignancies [96].The cross-talk between these cell cycle-related pathways, as well as others, such as G2/M checkpoint, MYC targets and DNA replication, found to be enriched in our analysis, point to several avenues through which overexpression of NOD1 may modulate cell proliferation. Dysregulation of these pathways might be the underlying mechanism of the reduced proliferation phenotype observed in HS578T/NOD1 cells [46].Bioinformatics analyses of the proteome of NOD2-overexpressing cells also suggested an upregulation of pathways involved in immune response and inflammation. Enrichment of pathways, such as the NOD-Like receptor signaling, Inflammation response and TNF signaling pathways, were supported by dysregulation of proteins, such as: CASP3, NFKB1 and the serine proteinase inhibitor PAI1 (SERPINE1). PAI1, detected in the inflammatory response pathway alongside NOD2, was reported to activate peptidoglycan-induced inflammation and autophagy in rat macrophages [97, 98], further linking the NOD inflammatory signaling to protein degradation pathways.Furthermore, downregulation of IGFBP-3 and upregulation of PAI1 suggest the involvement of the p53 signaling pathway. IGFBP-3, a direct p53 effector, has been shown to modulate proliferation by altering the interaction of IGFs to their cell surface receptors [99, 100]. Other proteins in the p53 pathway, such as the pro-tumorigenic GNL3, also supported the enrichment of MYC targets molecular signature. Targets of the MYC proto-oncogene are frequently observed in several human cancers, modulating cell cycle progression, apoptosis and cellular transformation [101].PAI1 and IGFBP-3 are also associated to the TGF-beta receptor signaling pathway [102], an interaction which was indicated in our HS578T/NOD2 protein network (Fig.3 b), as well as their downstream signaling to the major interacting node ERK1/2, (Fig. 4b).Involvement of ERK1/2 suggests that proliferation and survival may be regulated by the MAPK signaling pathway [103\u2013105]. Activation of ERK1/2 generally promotes proliferation and cell survival, however, under certain conditions, ERK1/2 may have pro-apoptotic functions, either by translocating to the nucleus [106, 107], or signaling through a cascade involving STAT proteins. Specifically, ERK1/2 can activate STAT6, which was upregulated in HS578T/NOD2. Other targets of ERK1/2 signaling are also upregulated in the NOD2 overexpressing cells, such as nucleolar MK67I (NFIK), which regulates mitosis by interacting with the Ki-67 antigen, [108] and the tumor suppressor and cell cycle regulator NOL7 [109].One of the outcomes of ERK1/2 signaling modulation is the dysregulation of protein synthesis pathways, as supported by the differential expression of several RPL and RPS proteins in HS578T/NOD2. Upregulation of several of these RPL proteins may be overestimated due to their higher expression in NOD2 replicate 1 (Fig. 2b). However, significance was maintained across statistical tests in both independent enrichment approaches. Bona fide upregulation of these proteins was also supported by the differential expression of correlate proteins, such as the eukaryotic translation initiation IF4G1, part of the complex responsible for mRNA loading to the ribosome [110].Dysregulation of ERK1/2 signaling may also be responsible for altering adhesion and migration of the NOD2-overexpressing cells. Several differentially regulated proteins in HS578T/NOD2 were identified in the Focal adhesion pathway, such as: the anchoring protein AKAP1, also shown to support mTOR-dependent tumor growth in breast cancer cells [111]; the actin-binding protein Plastin-2 (LCP-1) [112]; the actin-filament membrane anchor SVIL, which plays a critical role in tumor invasion [113]; and DAG1, a central component of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex that links the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton [114].Furthermore, upregulation of PAI1 in HS578T/NOD2 is a direct evidence of cell adhesion modulation. As PLAU inhibitor, PAI1 is directly involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and cell adhesion [115], promoting tumor progression and metastasis in several cancers, including breast cancer [116]. Interestingly, the effects of PAI1 in breast tumor progression seems to be regulated by a non-canonical TGF-beta1 pathway [102, 117, 118]. Moreover, it has also been proposed that PAI1 may regulate cell migration independently of its role as protease inhibitor [119, 120]. Modulation of these proteins may partially explain the in vitro phenotype of increased colony formation potential observed in the NOD2-overexpressing cells [46] .Our bioinformatics analyses on HS578T/NOD2 are consistent with a previous proteome analysis of HEK293 cells overexpressing NOD2, in which most of the differentially regulated proteins were associated to: biosynthesis, modification, or degradation of proteins; heat shock or protein folding; and DNA repair and replication [121]. Our Bioinformatics analyses on HS578T/NOD2 are consistent with a previous proteome analysis of HEK293 cells overexpressing NOD2, in which most of the differentially regulated proteins were associated to: biosynthesis, modification, or degradation of proteins; heat shock or protein folding; and DNA repair and replication [121].Despite their sequence similarities, NOD1 and NOD2 recognize different molecular patterns, being able to activate specific downstream pathways [38, 122], as reflected in the distribution of differentially regulated proteins between HS578T/NOD1 and HS578T/NOD2 (Fig. 2c). Despite the small protein overlap, the two groups shared several disrupted signaling pathways (Fig. 6), some of which are represented in the eight differentially regulated proteins shared between the two groups. These proteins include: a) A component of the translation machinery (BRX11) b) An IGF-binding protein (IGFBP-3) associated to TGF-beta and ERK1/2 (Fig. 3b), shown to modulate proliferation and apoptosis in vitro [99, 100]. c) Iduronate 2-sulfatase, which may indicate dysregulation of lysosomal degradation. Also, three cytoskeleton-associated proteins, namely: d) TBB2B, which is a major component of microtubules [123], e) AKAP1, shown to support mTOR-dependent tumor growth in breast cancer cells [111] and f) SRBS1, an adapter protein which regulates the assembly of kinase signaling complexes bound to the actin cytoskeleton. These signaling complexes promote protein interactions which induce both ubiquitination/degradation [124] and phosphorylation of targets [125]. One of these interactions is the AKT1-mediated activation of PAK1, indicating a critical role for SRBS1 in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, as indicated by SRBS1-dependent signaling regulation of pancreatic cell migration, adhesion and tumorigenicity [126].In this work, we applied high-throughput LC-MS/MS analyses to characterize the proteome of the Hs578T triple negative breast cancer-derived cell line, overexpressing either NOD1 or NOD2 receptors. We have previously reported that these cells have reduced proliferation and increased clonogenic potential in vitro [46]. The proteomic analysis suggests that overexpression of both NOD1 and NOD2 disrupt immune related pathways, notably those signaling through NF-\u03baB. The NF-\u03baB complex displayed a central role in our interaction networks, seemingly activated via antigen presentation signals (HLA class I histocompatibility proteins) and TNF signaling pathways. In the NOD1 overexpressing cells, upregulation of these immune-related pathways seems to modulate several stress response systems. In turn, immune and stress pathways may modulate both proteasome and autophagy degradation systems, and ultimately, dysregulate both proliferation and cellular adhesion/migration via PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways. In NOD2-overexpressing cells upregulation of immune-related pathways also seems to disrupt proliferation through MAPK signaling, via modulation of TNF and p53 pathways.Further investigation of these pathways and their crosstalk in this breast cancer model may provide insights into relevant targets for therapeutic intervention, possibly enabling immunomodulation of tumorigenesis in aggressive triple negative breast cancers.Development and culture conditions for parental (unmodified) or transduced triple-negative (ER-/PR-/HER2-) Hs578T (ATCC\u00ae HTB-126\u2122) cells were performed as previously described [46]. Transduced cells overexpress either GFP alone (HS578T/GFP), NOD1 (HS578T/NOD1) or NOD2 (HS578T/NOD2) genes. Of note, both HS578T/NOD1 and HS578T/NOD2 transduced cells co-express GFP (mediated by an IRES sequence downstream of respective NOD1/2 cDNAs into the original vectors).Cells from each experimental group were cultured independently, in triplicates, to obtain total lysate samples. For each sample, 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 cells were harvested by trypsin digestion and proteins were extracted in 8\u2009M urea, 50\u2009mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer, and subsequently digested with trypsin. Briefly, cysteine disulfide bonds were reduced with 5\u2009mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) at 30\u2009\u00b0C for 60\u2009min, followed by cysteine alkylation with 15\u2009mM iodoacetamide (IAA) in the dark, at room temperature for 30\u2009min. Following alkylation, urea was diluted to 1\u2009M urea using 50\u2009mM ammonium bicarbonate, and proteins were finally subjected to overnight digestion with mass spec grade Trypsin/Lys-C mix (Promega, Madison, WI). The digested proteins were desalted using AssayMap C18 cartridges mounted on a BRAVO liquid handling system (Agilent, Columbia, MD), and the organic solvent was removed in a SpeedVac concentrator prior to LC-MS/MS analysis.Dried samples were reconstituted with 2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid and analyzed by LC-MS/MS using a Proxeon EASY nanoLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated using an analytical C18 Acclaim PepMap column 0.075\u2009\u00d7\u2009500\u2009mm, 2\u2009\u03bcm particles (Thermo Scientific) in a 90-min linear gradient of 2\u201328% solvent B at a flow rate of 300\u2009nL/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive data-dependent acquisition mode. MS1 spectra were measured with a resolution of 120,000, an AGC target of 1e6, a maximum injection time of 100\u2009ms and a mass range from 350 to 1400\u2009m/z. The instrument was set to run at top speed mode with 3\u2009s\u2009cycles for the survey and the MS/MS scans. After a survey scan, tandem MS was performed on the most abundant precursors exhibiting a charge state from 2 to 8 of greater than 5e3 intensity by isolating them in the quadrupole at 0.8 Th. HCD fragmentation was applied with 30% collision energy and the resulting fragments were detected using the turbo scan rate of the ion trap. The AGC target for MS/MS was set to 1e4 and the maximum injection time limited to 15\u2009ms. The dynamic exclusion was set to 15\u2009s with a 10\u2009ppm mass tolerance around the precursor and its isotopes.All mass spectra were analyzed with MaxQuant software version 1.5.5.1 [127]. MS/MS spectra were searched against the Homo sapiens Uniprot protein sequence database (version July 2017) and GPM cRAP sequences (commonly known protein contaminants). Precursor mass tolerance was set to 20\u2009ppm and 4.5\u2009ppm for the first search where initial mass recalibration was completed and for the main search, respectively. Product ions were searched with a mass tolerance 0.5\u2009Da. The maximum precursor ion charge state used for searching was 7. Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was searched as a fixed modification, while oxidation of methionines and acetylation of protein N-terminal were searched as variable modifications. Enzyme was set to trypsin in a specific mode and a maximum of two missed cleavages was allowed for searching. The target-decoy-based false discovery rate (FDR) filter for spectrum and protein identification was set to 1%.The mass spectrometry data have been deposited in the ProteomeXchange Consortium [128] via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD012542.The evidence table output from MaxQuant was used for label-free protein quantitative analysis. First, calculated peptide intensities were log2-transformed and normalized across samples to account for systematic errors. A total of 8 normalization approaches were deployed (Loess, Robust Linear Regression, Variance Stabilization and Normalization, Total Intensity, Median Intensity, Average Intensity, NormFinder and Quantile), and their performance assessed [129] in order to determine the optimal normalization method (herein Loess normalization). Following normalization, all non-razor peptide sequences were removed from the list. Protein-level quantification and testing for differential abundance were performed using MSstats bioconductor package [130, 131] based on a linear mixed-effects model. The model decomposes log-intensities into the effects of technical and biological replicates, peptides and statistical interactions.The initial list was filtered to remove protein contaminants and proteins not detected in at least two of three replicates from each experimental group. Differentially regulated proteins were selected from the HS578T/NOD1 and HS578T/NOD2 experimental groups according to two inclusion thresholds, namely: (1)\u2009\u2265\u2009+\u20091 or\u2009\u2264\u2009\u2212\u20091 log2 fold-change from the unmodified Hs578T cells (P) and p-value of \u22640.05. (2)\u2009\u2265\u2009+\u20090.5 or\u2009\u2264\u2009\u2212\u20090.5 log2 fold-change from the unmodified Hs578T cells (P) and p-value \u22640.01. Additionally, proteins with log2 fold-change \u2265 +\u20091 or\u2009\u2264\u2009\u2212\u20091 between the two control groups (HS578T/GFP vs P) were excluded.Protein interaction networks, both organized by subcellular localization and by major interaction node (radial distribution), were obtained using the Ingenuity IPA\u2122 software (Ingenuity Systems, QIAGEN) from the lists of differentially regulated proteins.Gene Ontology (GO) cellular component term assignment for HS578T/NOD1 and HS578T/NOD2 were obtained via EnrichR [48, 132, 133] membership analysis from the lists of differentially regulated proteins. Bar graph based on GO database version 2017b, in which the bar length represents the statistical significance of the combined score of that specific gene-set or term. Combined score is computed by taking de log of the p-value from the Fisher exact test and multiplying that by the z-score of the deviation of the expected rank. Additionally, the brighter the color, the more significant that term is. Supporting protein evidence, from the differentially expressed lists, for each GO cellular component term is presented at the left of horizontal bars.Gene Ontology pathway enrichment analysis was also generated independently for both experimental groups, by EnrichR membership analysis, using the KEGG 2016 database. Bar length represents the statistical significance of the combined score (see above). Supporting protein evidence for each GO cellular component term is presented at the left of horizontal bars. Independent pathway enrichment analysis in Metascape [134, 135] was run concomitantly on HS578T/NOD1 and HS578T/NOD2 protein lists. KEGG, Reactome and GO database results are presented as enriched GO term Heatmap, color-coded from grey to brown according to log10(p) of the standard cumulative hypergeometric statistical test. Weighted enrichment pathway analysis of the complete set of 3189 identified proteins was performed using GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) 3.0 software [49, 50, 136]. Linear intensity values for each protein in the three replicates from Hs578T/NOD1, HS578T/NOD2 and parental control group were used to determine enriched gene sets (1000 permutations) from the following databases: h.all.v6.1.symbols.gmt [Hallmarks]; c2.cp.kegg.v6.1.symbols.gmt [curated]; c2.cp.reactome.v.6.1.symbols.gmt [curated].HLA class I histocompatibility antigen, A-2 alpha chainHLA class I histocompatibility antigen, B-51 alpha chainProtein AF1qA-kinase anchor protein 12Aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1 member A3Ankyrin-1Androgen ReceptorAtaxin-10Beta-2-microglobulinRibosome biogenesis protein BRX1 homologE-CadherinCell adhesion molecule 1Caspase-3Caspase-4Cyclin-dependent kinases regulatory subunit 1Collagen alpha-1(I) chainCollagen alpha-2(I) chainCollagen alpha-1(V) chainCollagen alpha-1(VI) chainCollagen alpha-1(XII) chainDystroglycanDanger-Associated Molecular PatternsDeoxycytidine kinaseDnaJ homolog subfamily A member 1DNA polymerase alpha subunit BDNA polymerase epsilon subunit 3Dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 4E-CadherinEukaryotic translation initiation factor 1bEukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma 1Estrogen ReceptorFAST kinase domain-containing protein 4False discovery ratePeptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase FKBP4Ferritin light chainFerritin light chainFYVE and coiled-coil domain-containing protein 1Guanine nucleotide-binding protein-like 3Gene OntologyGene Set Enrichment AnalysisHistone H2B type 1-BHistone H3.1Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2HLA class I histocompatibility antigen, A-2 alpha chainHLA class I histocompatibility antigen, B-51 alpha chainHeat shock protein HSP 90-alpha60\u2009kDa heat shock protein, mitochondrialHeat shock 70\u2009kDa protein 1BHeat shock cognate 71\u2009kDa proteinHeat-shock protein 90IodoacetamideIntercellular Adhesion Molecule 1Iduronate 2-sulfataseGamma-D-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acidEukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit 2Eukaryotic initiation factor 4A-IIEukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma 1Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3Inhibitory \u03baB KinaseImportin-4BTB/POZ domain-containing protein KCTD12Protein kinase C alpha typePlastin-2Leucine-Rich Repeat domainMitogen-Activated Protein KinaseMyb-binding protein 1AMini-chromosome maintenance proteinsDNA replication licensing factor MCM2DNA replication licensing factor MCM5DNA replication licensing factor MCM7Muramyl DipeptideMKI67 FHA domain-interacting nucleolar phosphoproteinMatrix metalloproteinase-14Molybdopterin synthase sulfur carrier subunitU3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein protein MPP10mRNA turnover protein 4 homologMyosin light chain kinase, smooth muscleNext to BRCA1 gene 1 proteinNuclear cap-binding protein subunit 1Normalized enrichment scoresNuclear factor \u03baBNF-kappa-B p105 subunitBeta-nerve growth factorNACHT and Leucine Rich Repeat domain containing proteinNucleotide-Binding Oligomerization Domain-Containing Protein 1Nucleotide-Binding Oligomerization Domain-Containing Protein 2Nucleolar protein 7Nuclear ubiquitous casein and cyclin-dependent kinase substrate 1Prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha-1Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1Pathogen-Associated Molecular PatternProcollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer 1PDZ and LIM domain protein 3ATP-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase, liver typePeptidoglycanUrokinase-type plasminogen activatorPurine nucleoside phosphorylaseProgesterone ReceptorPeroxiredoxin-1Pattern Recognition ReceptorRNA-binding protein with multiple splicingRac GTPase-activating protein 1Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2Ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase subunit M2Ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase subunit M2 B60S ribosomal protein L1860S ribosomal protein L640S ribosomal protein S30RNA polymerase-associated protein RTF1 homologProtein transport protein Sec23BProtein scribble homologStromal cell-derived factor 2-like protein 1Protein SGT1 homologDNA replication complex GINS protein SLD5Superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn]Spectrin alpha chain, non-erythrocytic 1Sequestosome-1Sorbin and SH3 domain-containing protein 2Sorbin and SH3 domain-containing protein 2Sulfiredoxin-1Signal transducer and activator of transcription 2Signal transducer and activator of transcription 6SupervillinTGF-\u03b2-activated kinase 1Tubulin beta-2B chainTris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphineTumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 8Triple Negative Breast CancerTripeptidyl-peptidase 1TNF receptor-associated factorsL-Ala-y-D-Glu-mDAPThioredoxin reductase 1, cytoplasmicThymidylate synthaseUbiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 E2Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 CUbiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 KUridine-cytidine kinase 2Unfolded protein responseUbiquitin-Proteasome SystemVascular Cell Adhesion Molecule 1Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family member 1F.J.V was supported by grants from CAPES (Federal Agency for Superior Education and Training) research funding agency.

In our previous work [46], we generated three Hs578T cell subpopulations, via lentiviral transduction of constructs containing either GFP alone (HS578T/GFP), or NOD1 (HS578T/NOD1) or NOD2 (HS578T/NOD2), both which also express GFP. Overexpression of either NOD1 or NOD2 receptors reduces cell proliferation but increases the clonogenic potential in vitro [46]. Elucidating the underlying pathways linking NOD1/NOD2 to tumorigenesis in these cells may reveal new targets for the highly challenging therapy for this highly invasive TNBC model. Therefore, three replicates of each of these cell populations, as well as the unmodified Hs578T cell line (P), were subjected to LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis. A total of 3189 unique proteins were identified in at least two of the three replicates in all four experimental groups. From this complete list, we have found 24 proteins to be downregulated (NOD1 vs P; log2 fold-change \u2264 \u2212\u20091, p-value \u22640.05), while 31 were upregulated (NOD1 vs P; log2\u2009\u2265\u2009+\u20091, p-value \u22640.05) in the group overexpressing NOD1 (HS578T/NOD1; Fig.\u00a01a). Similarly, nine proteins were downregulated (NOD2 vs P; log2 fold-change \u2264 \u2212\u20091, p-value \u22640.05) and 33 were upregulated (NOD2 vs P; log2\u2009\u2265\u2009+\u20091, p-value \u22640.05) in the HS578T/NOD2 group (Fig. 1b). A second threshold was established to include proteins with high statistical significance (p-value \u22640.01) but lower fold-change (log2 fold-change \u22650.5), which added 40 and 16 differentially regulated proteins to the HS578T/NOD1 and HS578T/NOD2 groups, respectively. Proteins with high effect size (log2 fold-change \u22651) between the two control groups (HS578T/GFP vs P) were excluded from the analysis. Combining these inclusion parameters, we narrowed down the differentially regulated proteins in the HS578T/NOD1 group to 95 (Fig. 1c), and the HS578T/NOD2 to 58 proteins (Fig. 1d). The top 30 upregulated or downregulated proteins for each experimental group are shown in Fig. 1 (full lists available as Additional file1: Figure S1), while the distribution of these proteins between the two experimental groups is represented in Fig.\u00a02c. Interestingly, the groups of upregulated and downregulated proteins from HS578T/NOD1 and HS578T/NOD2 were considerably dissimilar. Only eight proteins were shared between these two groups (Fig. 2c), while 87 and 50 proteins were exclusively present in the NOD1- and NOD2-overexpressing groups, respectively. The shared proteins were concordantly up- (MOC2A, AKAP1 and BRX11) or downregulated (SRBS1, IDS, IGFBP-3, AL1A3 and TBB2B) between the two experimental groups (Fig. 1a-d).\n\nFig. 1\nVolcano plots showing detected peptides (represented by annotated Entrez gene names) in samples overexpressing NOD1 (HS578T/NOD1) (a) and NOD2 (HS578T/NOD2) (b).

Thresholds for differentially expressed gene inclusion were established at +\u20091 or\u2009\u2212\u20091 log2 fold-change (x axis), from the unmodified HS578T cells (P). Similarly, a threshold for inclusion was set at p-value 0.05 (y axis).

Proteins with log2 fold-change \u2265 +\u20090.5 or\u2009\u2264\u2009\u2212\u20090.5 and p-value \u22640.01 were also included in the lists.

Circles in scale to group size\nInitially, an interaction network analysis with subcellular localization using Ingenuity\u00ae Pathway Analysis (IPA\u00ae) for the HS578T/NOD1 group, revealed that most of the relevant differentially regulated proteins localize to the cytosol, as expected, with a few notable membrane- (e.g. HLA class I histocompatibility antigen and CADM1) and nuclear-bound (e.g. RIR2 and RTF1) proteins (Fig.\u00a03a). Sequentially, a weighted enrichment analysis (Gene Ontology cellular component term assignment membership analysis) using EnrichR [48], indicated association (Fisher exact test) of these proteins to cytosolic structures, such as autolysosomes (e.g. FYCO1, FRIL and SQSTM), microtubule cytoskeleton (e.g. ANK1, DNJA1 and TBB2B) and the lysosomal matrix (e.g. HSP7C, IDS and TPP1) (Fig. 3c).\n\nFig. 3\nSubcellular localization and cellular component distribution.

Top supporting protein evidence for each GO cellular component term presented at the left of horizontal bars\nTo visualize the interactions among proteins identified as differentially regulated, we built radially-distributed interaction networks using IPA\u00ae. In agreement with the subcellular network for the proteins in HS578T/NOD1, this analysis indicated that the major pathway affected by NOD1 overexpression involved NF-kB signaling (Fig.\u00a04a). The centrally located NF-kB complex is directly related to transcription regulators, such as SQSTM and the autophagosome carrier FYCO1. Moreover, protein interactions in HS5778T/NOD2 indicated a major relationship to the ERK1/2 pathway (Fig. 4b), directly interacting with BRX11, IGFBP-3 and RL18.\n\nFig. 4\nNetworks representing protein-protein interactions in differentially regulated proteins from the NOD1 (HS578T/NOD1) (a) and NOD2 (HS578T/NOD2) (b) experimental groups.

Direct protein interactions are represented by continuous lines, while indirect relationships are represented by dotted lines\nTo investigate the molecular pathways affected by the overexpression of either NOD1 or NOD2, we subjected the differentially regulated proteins from both HS578T/NOD1 and HS578T/NOD2 groups to pathway enrichment analysis. EnrichR membership analysis using GO terms retrieved from the KEGG 2016 database, indicated that the 95 proteins from HS578T/NOD1 were largely associated to immune-related pathways, such as Antigen processing and presentation and NOD-like receptor signaling, due to the presence of heat-shock, HLA class I proteins and the SGT1 (Fig.\u00a05a). Notably, there was significant enrichment of nucleotide metabolism pathways (supported by proteins such as DPOA2 and RIR2) and Estrogen signaling (Heat-shock proteins and FKBP4). For the 58 proteins in HS578T/NOD2, the most relevant GO term association was to ribosome-related pathways, supported by the strong presence of RPL proteins, such as RL6 and RL18 (Fig. 5b). Several pathways associated to immune response and inflammation were also enriched, due to the presence of NFKB1, PAI1 and STAT6, among others. A second, unweighted, enrichment analysis was performed in METASCAPE, using KEGG, Reactome and GO databases. A parallel analysis of both experimental groups (Fig. 5c) presented several HS578T/NOD1-exclusive enriched terms (e.g. microtubule-based processes, NLR signaling pathways and MAPK cascade), fewer HS578T/NOD2-exclusive enriched GO terms (e.g. p53 signaling pathway and inrleukin-8 production) and also GO terms enriched in both groups (e.g. positive regulation of apoptosis and exocytosis).\n\nFig. 5\nGene Ontology (GO) pathway enrichment analysis for identified differentially expressed proteins in NOD1 (HS578T/NOD1) (a) and NOD2 (HS578T/NOD2) (b) groups, generated by EnrichR (http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr) membership analysis, using the KEGG 2016 database.

We have previously shown that overexpression of either NOD1 and NOD2 innate immune receptors impacts cell proliferation and clonogenic potential of the triple negative, breast cancer-derived Hs578T cell line [46]. To further investigate the signaling pathways driving this phenotype, we undertook global proteomic profiling of both NOD1 and NOD2 overexpressing cells. The findings from both Bioinformatics enrichment methodologies applied are presented in Fig.\u00a06.\n\nFig. 6\nMolecular pathways enriched in HS578T/NOD1 and HS578T/NOD2 according to both EnrichR/Metascape (Blue boxes) and GSEA (Red boxes) Bioinformatics analyses, with examples of upregulated or downregulated proteins supporting each enriched pathway.

Merr) that have important roles in providing defense against pathogens. They also have impressive anticancer and neuroprotective activities in mammals. Despite their potential usefulness as therapeutics, glyceollins are not economical to synthesize and are biosynthesized only transiently and in low amounts in response to specific stresses. Engineering the regulation of glyceollin biosynthesis may be a promising approach to enhance their bioproduction, yet the transcription factors (TFs) that regulate their biosynthesis have remained elusive. To address this, we first aimed to identify novel abiotic stresses that enhance or suppress the elicitation of glyceollins and then used a comparative transcriptomics approach to search for TF gene candidates that may positively regulate glyceollin biosynthesis.Acidity stress (pH\u20093.0 medium) and dehydration exerted prolonged (week-long) inductive or suppressive effects on glyceollin biosynthesis, respectively. RNA-seq found that all known biosynthetic genes were oppositely regulated by acidity stress and dehydration, but known isoflavonoid TFs were not. Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) genes were highly enriched in the geneset. We chose to functionally characterize the NAC (NAM/ATAF1/2/CUC2)-family TF GmNAC42\u20131 that was annotated as an SAR gene and a homolog of the Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) indole alkaloid phytoalexin regulator ANAC042. Overexpressing and silencing GmNAC42\u20131 in elicited soybean hairy roots dramatically enhanced and suppressed the amounts of glyceollin metabolites and biosynthesis gene mRNAs, respectively. Yet, overexpressing GmNAC42\u20131 in non-elicited hairy roots failed to stimulate the expressions of all biosynthesis genes. Thus, GmNAC42\u20131 was necessary but not sufficient to activate all biosynthesis genes on its own, suggesting an important role in the glyceollin gene regulatory network (GRN). The GmNAC42\u20131 protein directly bound the promoters of biosynthesis genes IFS2 and G4DT in the yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) system.Acidity stress is a novel elicitor and dehydration is a suppressor of glyceollin biosynthesis. The TF gene GmNAC42\u20131 is an essential positive regulator of glyceollin biosynthesis. Overexpressing GmNAC42\u20131 in hairy roots can be used to increase glyceollin yields >\u200910-fold upon elicitation. Thus, manipulating the expressions of glyceollin TFs is an effective strategy for enhancing the bioproduction of glyceollins in soybean.In 1939\u2009K.O. Mueller et al. reported that metabolites that were elicited in potato upon inoculation with an incompatible race of Phytophthora infestans subsequently provided resistance to a compatible race [1]. Since then, the pathogen-inducible defense metabolites that have been identified from numerous plant species have collectively been referred to as \u2018phytoalexins\u2019. Some phytoalexins have essential roles in defending agricultural crops against major pathogens. A classic example is the glyceollins of soybean that provide resistance to the oomycete Phytophthora sojae [2\u20134]. For decades researchers have studied the genetic regulation of phytoalexin elicitation by pathogens. Efforts have recently focused on identifying the transcription factors (TFs) that activate phytoalexin biosynthesis, a goal that has been confounded by the myriad of plant responses that occur synchronously in response to pathogens. Phytoalexins are biosynthetically diverse among plant species and include the isoflavonoid-derived glyceollins from soybean, the phenylpropanoid stilbenes from grapevine, the phenolic aldehyde gossypol from cotton, the terpenoid momilactones and phytocassanes from rice, and the indole alkaloid camalexin from Arabidopsis [5\u201310]. Since the TFs that activate the biosynthesis of phytoalexins in different plant species belong to different gene families and/or are non-homologous, for decades an important question has remained whether phytoalexin TFs are as diverse as the biosynthetic pathways that they regulate. Yet, several excellent reviews highlight that phytoalexins share common abiotic elicitors [11\u201313]. This could suggest conserved regulatory pathways and TFs among plant species despite the biosynthetic heterogeneity of phytoalexins.Highly conserved abiotic elicitors of phytoalexins include heavy metals, herbicides, and UV irradiation. UV elicits stilbene phytoalexins in grapevine, Cissus Antarctica, and Cannabis sativa [14], the flavonoid and diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice [15, 16], camalexin in Arabidopsis [17], and glyceollins in soybean [18]. In rice, loss-of-function mutants of the JA biosynthesis gene allene oxide cyclase (aos) or jasmonic acid-amido synthetase (osjar1\u20132) resulted in an almost complete loss of sakuranetin elicitation in response to UV [19]. Yet, the diterpenoid phytoalexins of rice were not affected in JA biosynthesis mutants. Copper chloride (CuCl2) elicitation of sakuranetin, momilactone, and diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice was dramatically reduced by JA biosynthesis inhibitors [20]. The heavy metal silver nitrate (AgNO3) elicited glyceollin accumulation in soybean by reducing its degradation and by enhancing the hydrolysis of isoflavone-glycoside conjugates that compete with glyceollins for the common biosynthetic intermediate daidzein [21]. AgNO3 was shown to antagonize many plant development processes by inhibiting ethylene perception [22]. Yet, glyceollin elicitation by AgNO3 was largely independent of ethylene signaling [21]. Herbicides such as acifluorfen elicit at least in part via the reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling pathway(s). The ups1 loss-of-function mutant of Arabidopsis defective in ROS signaling had reduced camalexin levels in response acifluorfen [23]. ups1 also had reduced camalexin levels in response to Pseudomonas syringae and P. syringae pv maculicola (Psm), suggesting a shared biotic and abiotic elicitation pathway. In soybean, treatments with JA, ethylene, P. sojae WGE, or hydroxyl radical (a ROS) were highly effective at priming glyceollin biosynthesis in cells distal to the point of treatment, whereas SA was not [23, 24].In contrast to the abiotic stresses and signaling molecules that have conserved roles in eliciting phytoalexins in response to abiotic stresses, the TFs found to regulate phytoalexin biosynthesis have varied widely among plant species. GaWRKY1 activated gossypol biosynthesis in cotton [8]. GaWRKY1 transcripts were induced by methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and Verticillium dahlia but not by SA or H2O2. GaWRKY1 transcripts were co-expressed both spatially and temporally with gossypol biosynthesis genes and GaWRKY1 was able to directly bind the promoter of (+)-\u03b4-cadinene synthase (CAD1) in the Y1H system. Another WRKY-family TF, namely AtWRKY33, was identified from Arabidopsis to directly bind and activate the promoter of the camalexin biosynthesis gene PAD3 [25]. WRKY33 transcripts were induced by the ROS-inducing herbicide paraquat, SA, and necrotrophic fungal pathogens [10]. GaWRKY1 and AtWRKY33 were not homologous since the proteins they encode had more than 20 other proteins that were more similar by reciprocal BLASTPs.The R2R3-type MYB TF genes VvMYB14 and VvMYB15 from grapevine were co-induced with stilbene biosynthesis genes in response to UV irradiation, wounding, and the pathogen Plasmopara viticola [26]. The proteins directly bound the promoter of STILBENE SYNTHASE (STS) in transient gene reporter assays using grapevine suspension cells and induced the accumulation of stilbenes when overexpressed in grapevine hairy roots [26]. Homologs of VvMYB14 and VvMYB15 in Arabidopsis did not regulate camalexin biosynthesis but rather cold tolerance and defense-induced lignification, respectively [27, 28]. Double and triple mutants of the Arabidopsis R2R3 MYBs AtMYB34, AtMYB51, and AtMYB122 had reduced camalexin levels upon elicitation with UV, AgNO3, and a PAMP isolated from Pythium aphanidermatum (PaNie) [29]. However, these three MYBs were unable to bind camalexin biosynthesis gene promoters and feeding the triple mutant plant with a biosynthetic intermediate restored camalexin accumulation, suggesting that AtMYB34, AtMYB51, and AtMYB122 did not regulate camalexin biosynthesis directly but rather an upstream process in the elicitation pathway [29]. The constitutive overexpression of the sorghum R2R3 MYB gene yellow seed (y1) in maize resulted in the ectopic accumulation of 3-deoxyanthocyanidins in vegetative tissues only upon challenge with Colletotrichum graminicola [5]. VvMYB15 and VvMYB14 were not homologs of y1 since reciprocal BLASTp\u2019s revealed 5\u201320 proteins that were more similar.RNAi silencing of the bHLH-family TF gene OsMYC2 from rice almost completely eliminated the elicitation of sakuranetin in response to JA treatment [6]. OsMYC2 directly activated the promoter of a sakuranetin biosynthesis gene by transient transactivation assays in rice leaves [6]. Transcripts of another bHLH TF gene from rice, namely OsDPF, were inducible in rice leaves by UV, CuCl2 and blast infection [9]. OsDPF directly activated the promoters of phytocassane and momilactone biosynthesis genes by transient transactivation assays in rice leaves. Overexpressing OsDPF resulted in increased expression of all diterpenoid biosynthetic genes and the accumulation of momilactones and phytocassanes, whereas decreased levels were observed in RNAi knock-down lines. Two homologous JA-inducible bHLHs, TSAR1 and TSAR2, were identified to directly activate triterpene saponin biosynthesis genes in Medicago truncatula [9]. TSAR1 and TSAR2 were not among the top 20 most similar proteins compared to OsDPF or OsMYC2, and OsDPF was only the 10th most similar to OsMYC2.A NAC-type TF gene, AtANAC042, was identified from Arabidopsis by T-DNA insertion mutagenesis to have reduced levels of camalexin biosynthesis gene expressions and metabolites when elicited with the ROS-inducing herbicide acifluorofen, bacterial flagellin, or A. brassicicola [7]. Bacterial flagellin stimulated the accumulation of AtANAC042 transcripts at the elongation zone of the root (the site of camalexin biosynthesis), and the induction was abolished in the presence of either MeJA, a general kinase inhibitor (K252a), or a Ca2+-chelator (BAPTA).Collectively, these studies have demonstrated that phytoalexin biosynthetic pathways are regulated by disparate, non-homologous TFs in different plant species, raising the question of whether any TF has a conserved role in regulating the biosynthesis of phytoalexins in plants. Here, we used a comparative transcriptomics approach on soybean that was exposed to novel abiotic stresses and identified a conserved phytoalexin regulator.(\u2212)-Glyceollin I was from Dr. Paul Erhardt (University of Toledo). Soybean isoflavonoid standards were purified and characterized according to [21]. Isoflavone standards were from Extrasynthese (France). Solvents were LC-MS grade (Fisher).Soybean seeds were obtained from the USDA-GRIN soybean germplasm collection and from Elroy Cober (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada). Harosoy 63 seeds (16 per batch) were sterilized in 30\u2009mL of 70% ethanol, 0.2% triton X (v/v) for 5\u2009min on a mixer wheel, rinsed thrice with sterile water, and imbibed overnight. The imbibate was then discarded to remove growth inhibitors and seeds were transferred to water soaked sterile vermiculite (250\u2009mL in volume) in 500\u2009mL beakers. The beaker tops were covered with ring-shaped sterile cheese cloth and covered with plastic wrap to ensure aseptic growth. The cheese cloth permitted passage of air between plastic wrap and the beaker top and the ring shape permitted the passage of light from above the beaker. Seedlings were grown at 22\u2009\u00b0C under a 16\u2009h photoperiod using cool white T5 fluorescent lights (500 \u03bcE m\u2212\u20092\u2009s\u2212\u20091). At the first trifoliate leaf stage (~\u20098\u2009day old), seedling roots were gently rinsed with sterile water to remove vermiculite and were transferred to stress treatments.For all stress treatments, the roots of five seedlings were wrapped together in a germination paper (Sartorius AG, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany) saturated with half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium (pH\u20095.8) containing vitamins and 1% (w/v) sucrose unless indicated otherwise. The wrapped seedlings were transferred to a 100\u2009mL beaker containing 50\u2009mL of the above medium for the control, cold, heat, wounding and UV-C treatments. Each of the 100\u2009mL beakers were then placed inside a sterile 500\u2009mL beaker and the 500\u2009mL beaker tops were again covered with a ring-shape cut of sterile cheese cloth overlaid with plastic wrap. The volume of the medium in the basin of the 100\u2009mL beaker was maintained daily for all treatments, with the exception of the dehydration treatment. For dehydration, the medium-saturated germination paper was allowed to dry gradually in the 100\u2009mL beaker containing no medium. All seedlings were grown under the temperature and lighting conditions listed above unless otherwise indicated. For heat and cold treatments, the 500\u2009mL beakers were transferred to 37 and 15\u2009\u00b0C, respectively. For high carbon stress, the growth medium in the 100\u2009mL beaker was replaced with 3% sucrose in water. For flooding, control medium was maintained up to the level of the hypocotyl-root junction throughout the 9 d treatment. For phosphate deprivation (\u2212P), half-strength MS medium (pH\u20095.8) that lacked phosphate was used (Caisson Labs, Smithfield, UT). For UV-C treatment, seedlings in beakers were exposed to a 30\u2009W\u2009g30\u2009t8 germicidal light (Philips, NV) every day for 1\u2009h. For acidity stress, seedlings were transferred half-strength MS medium pH\u20093.0 (acidified with HCl).After 9 d of treatment (unless indicated otherwise), the five seedlings per treatment were unwrapped and separated, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, lyophilized to dryness, and individually ground to a fine powder and stored at \u2212\u200980\u2009\u00b0C for metabolite and RNA extractions. The stored tissue powder was lyophilized again for 1\u2009h prior to weighing.For hairy root experiments, only secondary roots that grew to 3\u20136\u2009cm on selection media were considered transgenic and were used for WGE treatments. Roots were cut into 1-cm pieces then overlaid with sterile water (mock) or wall glucan elicitor (WGE) that was extracted from P. sojae according to [21]. For RNA extraction, 100\u2009mg of fresh tissue was harvested on ice and freeze dried prior to storage at \u2212\u200980\u2009\u00b0C. For metabolite analyses, fresh hairy root tissues (~\u2009100\u2009mg) were extracted immediately upon harvesting without lyophilization.For analysis of seedlings, lyophilized tissue powder (12\u2009mg) was extracted with 80% ethanol (10\u2009\u03bcL\u2009mg\u2212\u20091 dry tissue) and isoflavonoid identifications were done by UPLC-PDA-MSn as indicated in [21]. Four seedlings per treatment were individually extracted for metabolite analysis. Metabolite analyses of pH\u20093.0 medium, dehydration stress, and control treatments were confirmed by three independent experiments.Hairy roots were extracted with 80% ethanol (1\u2009\u03bcL\u2009mg\u2212\u20091 fresh weight, FW) as described [21]. For all hairy root experiments, five biological replicates were analyzed per treatment. Two independent transformation experiments were analyzed per DNA construct. Absolute amounts of isoflavonoids were determined by comparison of the UPLC-PDA peak areas to a concentration curve of purified or authentic standards as described in [21].Total RNA was isolated from lyophilized tissue powder using the Spectrum Plant Total RNA Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as described [21]. Total RNA (500\u2009ng) was treated with DNase I (Amplification grade, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) to remove genomic DNA and cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). cDNA templates were diluted 4-fold with water and qRT-PCR was conducted as described [21]. All qRT-PCR experiments included four biological replicates and two technical replicates. Primers used in this study are listed in Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S1.Total RNA was extracted from the powder of individual seedlings as described above. Three individual seedlings per stress treatment and their respective controls were used to make a total of 12 libraries for RNA-seq analysis. RNA samples were sent to the Genomics Core Facility of West Virginia University for library preparation. The quality of each RNA sample was determined using an RNA Nano 6000 Chip and an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara, CA). RNA samples with an Integrity Number (RIN) greater than 8.0 were used to prepare the libraries. Following quantification of RNA using a Qubit fluorometer, libraries were constructed from 750\u2009ng using the mRNA stranded library prep kit (KAPA Biosystems) as per manufacturer\u2019s protocol with nine cycles of PCR. The completed cDNA libraries were quantified using a Qubit and pooled in equimolar ratios prior to sequencing at the Marshall University Genomics Core. The 100\u2009bp paired-end reads were generated using a HiSeq1500 system (Illumina). Eight libraries were sequenced per lane in high-output mode.Data filtering was carried out to eliminate adapter sequences and/or low-quality reads. The quality of raw reads was determined using FastQC software (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and clean reads were then mapped/aligned to Glycine max reference genome (Gmax_275_V2.0.fa, https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html) using STAR RNA-seq aligner [30] with default mode based on the current gene annotation. Only the paired mapped reads were considered for further analyses. Reads were quantified using using featureCounts [31]. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using a Negative Binomial Distribution in DESeq2 [32]. Multiple hypothesis correction was conducted with Benjamini Hochberg procedure to get an adjusted P value at 0.05 which decrease the false discovery rate (FDR). Principle component analysis, heatmap and clustering of the samples were done to check the robustness of the analysis. For the identification of gene homologs, genes were considered to be homologous if their predicted protein sequences were the best matches in reciprocal BLASTPs.The GmNAC42\u20131 ORF was PCR amplified from the cDNA of Harosoy63 seedlings treated with pH\u20093.0 medium (9 dat) by the attB Adapter PCR protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using Phusion polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and primers (Additional file 1: Table S1). The amplicon was cloned into the donor vector pDONR221 using BP Clonase II (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and following sequencing was LR recombined downstream of GFP in the pGWB6 vector to assay subcellular localization and downstream of the GAL4 activation domain in the pDEST-GADT7 vector for Y1H. For silencing, a 227-bp region of exon 2 of GmNAC42\u20131 was amplified from cDNA and BP cloned into pDONR221, which after sequencing was LR subcloned into the RNAi vector pANDA35HK. Hairpin integrations were confirmed by sequencing.Transgenic soybean hairy roots were produced according to [33] with some modifications. Relatively large Williams 82 soybean seeds without cracks were surface sterilized with 70% isopropyl alcohol (v/v) for 30\u2009s and 10% commercial bleach (6.0% (v/v) sodium hypochlorite) for 5\u2009min with gentle agitation, then rinsed three times in sterile MilliQ-filtered water (EMD Millipore, MA). Seeds were transferred to germination paper saturated with germination and co-cultivation (GC) medium (half-strength MS salts (Caisson Labs, UT), 1% sucrose, pH\u20095.8, and MS vitamins) in a sterile Petri dish and germinated for 3 d in the dark, then transferred to cool white T5 fluorescent lights (100 \u03bcE s\u2212\u20091\u2009m2) at 24\u2009\u00b0C, a condition that was used for all subsequent soybean transformation steps.Following pre-culture on LB-agar plates containing 50\u2009mg\u2009L\u2212\u20091 kanamycin and hygromycin, Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain K599 containing the empty vector or construct DNA were resuspended to an OD600 of 0.5\u20130.8 in phosphate buffer (0.01\u2009M Na2HPO4, 0.15\u2009M NaCl, pH\u20097.5) containing 100\u2009\u03bcM acetosyringone. Cotyledons were gently twisted off of 6\u20137 d old seedlings. The apical meristem and hypocotyl was excised and several 1\u2009mm-deep cuts were made across the adaxial surface of the cotyledon with a scalpel previously dipped in the Agrobacterium solution. Twenty-four to 36 cotyledons were inoculated per DNA. Cotyledons were placed adaxial-side-down on germination paper saturated with GC medium containing 100\u2009\u03bcM acetosyringone and co-cultivated for 3 d at 22\u2009\u00b0C under low light (65 \u03bcE s\u2212\u20091\u2009m2) on a 16\u2009h photoperiod. Cotyledons were then cultured adaxial-side-up on hairy root growth (HRG) medium (half strength MS salts, 3% sucrose (w/v) (pH\u20095.8) with gelzan (2.4\u2009g\u2009L\u2212\u20091; Sigma-Aldrich, MO), MS vitamins (2.5\u2009mL\u2009L\u2212\u20091) and timentin (500\u2009mg\u2009L\u2212\u20091). Fourteen to 21 d later, transgenic primary roots with 2\u20133\u2009cm secondary roots were transferred to and selected on HRG containing 50\u2009mg\u2009L\u2212\u20091 kanamycin and hygromycin. Only secondary roots that grew to 3\u20136\u2009cm were considered transgenic and were used for treatments. All hairy root experiments were conducted two times independently, representative results are shown.Soybean hairy roots transformed with nGFP-pGWB6 or nGFP-NAC42\u20131-pGWB6 were harvested and stained with propidium iodide according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Three-to-four roots per genotype per two independent transformation events were analyzed and a representative result is shown. Confocal images were acquired using a Nikon A1R Si confocal laser with N-SIM-E, a TiE inverted research microscope, and NIS Elements software. Imaging was performed using an Apo oil 60\u00d7 objective, plus 1.5\u00d7 optical zoom, and 6\u00d7 digital zoom. Excitation and emission spectra were 488\u2009nm and 500\u2013550\u2009nm for GFP and 488\u2009nm and 570\u2013620\u2009nm for propidium iodide, respectively.G4DT and IFS2 promoter regions 1 and 2 flanked by attL4 and attR1 recombination sites (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Table S2) were synthesized by Genscript (Piscataway, NJ) and recombined into the destination vector pMW#2 (Addgene, Cambridge, MA) using LR clonase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Clones were selected by colony PCR then sequenced. Constructs were linearized by digestion with AflII (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) prior to transformation into yeast strain YM4271 (MATa, ura3\u201352, his3\u2013200, lys2\u2013801, ade2\u2013101, ade5, trp1\u2013901, leu2\u20133, 112, tyr1\u2013501, gal4D, gal80D, ade5::hisG) and were selected by growth in dropout medium lacking histidine (SD-His). Bait strains containing genomic integrations were confirmed by colony PCR using a pair of promoter- and genome-specific primers (Additional file 1: Table S1). Bait strains were transformed with pDEST-GADT7 (ABRC, Columbus, OH) or with GmNAC42\u20131-pDEST-GADT7 and transformants were selected on media lacking histidine and leucine (SD-His-Leu) then confirmed by colony PCR. Autoactivation was tested for and positive DNA-protein interactions were determined by growth in SD-His-Leu medium containing increasing concentrations (5, 10, 20, 40 and 60\u2009mM) of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT; Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH), as previously described [34]. Three biological replicates are shown, results were confirmed by two independent experiments.Seedlings were transferred to eight abiotic stress conditions and the amounts of total phytoalexins were enhanced significantly by pH\u20093.0 medium, UV-C, and dehydration compared to the control (ANOVA, Tukey post hoc test, P\u2009<\u20090.01) (Fig. 2b). pH\u20093.0 medium stimulated the greatest increase, having 22.7-fold greater amounts of total phytoalexins compared to the control and significantly greater amounts compared to all other treatments. UPLC-PDA chromatograms revealed major increases in the levels of glyceollins for pH\u20093.0 medium, and major reductions in the amounts of 6-O-malonyldaidzin for dehydration and pH\u20093.0 medium that were not observe for the UV-C treatment (Fig. 2c). pH\u20093.0 medium and dehydration predominantly caused increases in the amounts of glyceollin III and glyceollin II (Fig. 2d). Overall, pH\u20093.0 medium had the greatest increase in glyceollin amounts, with glyceollin III becoming 25% of the total measured isoflavonoid content.Pathogens generally elicit maximum glyceollin biosynthesis within 24\u201348\u2009h of inoculation, then the levels rapidly decline [4, 35]. To understand the dynamics of the regulation of glyceollin biosynthesis by pH\u20093.0 medium and dehydration, we measured metabolite levels at regular intervals up to 9 dat.To determine whether pH\u20093.0 medium and dehydration stresses regulated glyceollin biosynthesis gene transcripts, we measured the expression of key biosynthetic genes by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Specifically, we measured the expressions of isoflavone synthase 1 (IFS1) and IFS2, isogenes for the biosynthesis of isoflavones (Fig. 1). We also measured the expressions of isoflavone 2\u2032-hydroxylase (I2\u2019H) and glycinol 4-dimethylallyltransferase (G4DT), genes for the biosynthesis of all daidzein-derived phytoalexins and glyceollin I, respectively [36, 37].pH\u20093.0 medium upregulated all gene transcripts at 9 dat. The levels ranged from 4.4- to 20.7-fold greater than the control for I2\u2019H and IFS2, respectively (Fig. 3b). By contrast, dehydration stress had reduced levels of all gene transcripts at 6 dat, ranging from 2.2- to 11.7-fold less than the control for IFS2 and I2\u2019H, respectively.To investigate whether pH\u20093.0 medium and dehydration oppositely regulated all known glyceollin biosynthesis genes, we conducted RNA-seq comparing genes upregulated by pH\u20093.0 medium to those downregulated by dehydration.Since our RNA-seq analyses found that pH\u20093.0 medium and dehydration regulated glyceollin biosynthesis at the level of transcription, we hypothesized that TF genes required for the activation of those biosynthesis genes would also be present in our geneset. Yet, all previously identified isoflavonoid TF genes were not found. Those absent included TF genes identified by QTL mapping of isoflavonoid amounts, namely GmMYBJ3 (Glyma.06\u2009g193600) or GmMYB29 (Glyma20g35180) [39, 40]. Also absent were TFs that activated the biosynthesis of chalcone synthase-derived isoflavonoids during seed development, namely GmMYB176 (Glyma.05G032200) and GmCYP1 (Glyma.11G098700) [41, 42].Among the putative soybean SAR genes were three homologs of the NAC [no apical meristem (NAM), Arabidopsis transcription activation factor [ATAF1/2] and cup-shaped cotyledon (CUC2)] family gene ANAC042/AtJUB1. ANAC042/AtJUB1 regulates camalexin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis in response to the ROS-inducing herbicide acifluorofen, Alternaria brassicicola, and bacterial flagellin (Flg22) [7].The predicted GmNAC42 proteins were 68.5\u201385.8% similar to each other and 54.3\u201356.7% similar to ANAC042/JUB1 with GmNAC42\u20131 being the most similar (Additional\u00a0file\u00a06: Table S6). The N-terminal halves of these proteins contained the conserved NAM domain (pfam02365) putatively involved in dimerization and binding DNA (Additional\u00a0file\u00a07: Fig. S1). The N-terminal halves of the GmNAC42s were highly similar to ANAC042/JUB1 (76.2\u201383.3%), whereas the C-terminal halves putatively involved in protein-protein interactions were highly divergent (30.5\u201334.9% similarity) (Additional file 6: Table S6). A phylogenetic analysis of the predicted GmNAC42 proteins with characterized NACs revealed that the GmNAC42s were most closely related to VvNAC42_5 (Fig. 5c). VvNAC42_5 is an SA-independent powdery mildew responsive gene from grapevine (Vitis vinifera) [50]. Also in this cluster were proteins that positively regulate drought stress responses, namely SlJUB1 and DlNAC1 [51, 52].To probe further whether GmNAC42s may be positive regulators of glyceollins, we assessed whether their gene expressions were upregulated by the wall glucan elicitor (WGE) from P. sojae.Treatment of soybean hairy roots with WGE resulted in maximum accumulation of glyceollins at 24\u2009h after treatment (Fig. 5d). qRT-PCR found that all three GmNAC42s were upregulated 9.6- to 14.4-fold at this time with the glyceollin biosynthesis gene G4DT (Fig. 5e). GmNAC42\u20131 was the most highly upregulated.We chose to investigate the function of GmNAC42\u20131 since it is the soybean homolog of ANAC042, an indole alkaloid phytoalexin regulator from Arabidopsis, and since its gene expressions coincided with the elicitation of glyceollin biosynthesis. If GmNAC42\u20131 positively regulates glyceollin biosynthesis, silencing its gene expressions in elicited tissues should reduce the accumulation of glyceollin metabolites and biosynthesis gene transcripts. Conversely, overexpressing GmNAC42\u20131 should increase the accumulation of glyceollins and their biosynthesis gene transcripts. To test, we produced soybean hairy roots harboring an RNA interference (RNAi) construct that encoded a hairpin dsRNA identical to a 227\u2009bp region of exon 2 of GmNAC42\u20131 and roots that overexpressed the GmNAC42\u20131 open reading frame (ORF) via the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter (p35S).RNAi silencing of WGE-elicited roots decreased the amounts of glyceollin I, II and III 4.0-, 2.8- and 3.2-fold, respectively (Fig. 6d). It also caused 2.0-fold decreases in the amounts of 6-O-malonyldaidzin and daidzin (Fig. 6d), consistent with decreased expressions of IFS2 (Fig. 6a). Overexpressing GmNAC42\u20131 in WGE-elicited roots resulted in 10.8-, 4.9-, and 3.0-fold increases in the amounts of glyceollin I, genistein, and glyceollin II, respectively (Fig. 6e). It also caused a 1.6-to 2.7-fold reduction in the amounts of daidzin and 6-O-malonyldaidzin, consistent with upregulating G4DT (Fig. 6b). In the absence of WGE treatment, the overexpression of GmNAC42\u20131 alone was not sufficient to stimulate glyceollin accumulation, reflecting its inability to upregulate all glyceollin-specific biosynthesis genes when overexpressed. However, it did result in a 2.4-fold reduction in the amounts of 6-O-malonyldaidzin [21].To test whether the GmNAC42\u20131 protein could directly bind the promoters of glyceollin biosynthesis genes, the ORF was also cloned downstream of the GAL4 activation domain and expressed in yeast harboring several 500\u2009bp segments of IFS2 or G4DT promoters (Fig. 7g). GmNAC42\u20131 weakly activated the G4DT promoter segment closest the transcription start site (G4DTpro1) that had one predicted NAC binding element (T/ATTGACT/C), failed to activate the segment that lacked the element (G4DTpro1), and strongly activated both IFS2 promoter segments that each had several elements (Fig. 7h).In this study, we found that transcripts of the NAC-family TF gene GmNAC42\u20131 were upregulated with glyceollin biosynthesis genes and metabolites when soybean tissues were elicited by acidity stress or the biotic elicitor WGE from P. sojae. They were also downregulated with glyceollin biosynthesis genes and metabolites by dehydration stress. The overexpression and silencing of GmNAC42\u20131 in WGE-treated hairy roots enhanced and suppressed, respectively, the expressions of the isoflavone biosynthetic genes IFS1 and IFS2, the glyceollin-specific gene G4DT, and the accumulation of glyceollin metabolites. Since G4DT is specifically involved in glyceollin biosynthesis, the results suggest that GmNAC42\u20131 is a regulator of glyceollin elicitation and not the biosynthesis of constitutively accumulating isoflavone conjugates. However, overexpressing or silencing GmNAC42\u20131 did not affect the expression levels of I2\u2019H, one of the key genes required for glyceollin biosynthesis [54]. Further, overexpression of GmNAC42\u20131 in the absence of WGE did not result in the accumulation of glyceollins. Thus, our results showed that GmNAC42\u20131 is required for the full elicitation of glyceollin biosynthesis in response to P. sojae WGE, but is not sufficient to upregulate all glyceollin biosynthesis genes.The nGFP-GmNAC42\u20131 fusion protein localized to the nucleus in the absence of an elicitor treatment and thus did not rely on elicitor treatment for nuclear localization as observed for the phytoalexin TF AtWRKY33 or the NAC-family TFs StNTP1 and StNTP2 [55, 56]. Since GmNAC42\u20131 is essential for full elicitation of glyceollins, we suggest that GmNAC42\u20131 acts in concert with at least one other TF to coordinately activate all glyceollin biosynthetic genes. Further, by upregulating some but not all glyceollin genes, GmNAC42\u20131 could also function in SAR to prime soybean tissues distal to an inoculation site for subsequent rapid/high-level elicitation [23, 57, 58]. A subsequent direct inoculation of the primed tissues would activate the expressions or activity of one or more additional TFs that upregulates I2\u2019H and other glyceollin biosynthesis genes that are not regulated by GmNAC42\u20131 alone. In that case, overexpressing GmNAC42\u20131 could serve as an alternative to spraying the lactofen-containing herbicide Cobra that primes glyceollin biosynthesis to increase resistance against pathogens such as white mold, the causal agent of sclerotinia stem rot, without adversely effecting yield [59, 60]. Future experiments should test whether overexpressing GmNAC42\u20131 in soybean plants primes glyceollin biosynthesis without adverse effects on yield as well. Since the rapidity of glyceollin elicitation is a major factor that distinguishes resistant to P. sojae (Rps) soybean genotypes from nearly-isogenic susceptible genotypes [61\u201364], experiments should also test whether overexpressing GmNAC42\u20131 enhances the rapidity of glyceollin elicitation in response to compatible P. sojae (Rps) genotypes.The regulation of phytoalexins by pathogens and specific abiotic stresses suggests that elicitation is highly complex and may require multiple signaling pathways. This study in soybean identified acidity stress (pH\u20093.0 medium) and dehydration as novel regulators of phytoalexin biosynthesis. Transcriptome analysis found that the genes upregulated by acidity stress and downregulated by dehydration were reminiscent of pathogen responses, with SAR genes being highly overrepresented. The SAR genes included homologs of Arabidopsis ALD1 and FMO1 that synthesize the systemic signaling molecules Pip and its derivative N-hydroxypipecolic acid (NHP) to orchestrate priming of pathogen responses [46, 47], and the lipase-like and TF Arabidopsis genes PAD4 and ANAC042 that regulate the biosynthesis of camalexin in Arabidopsis [7, 48]. Here, we found that GmNAC42\u20131 is the soybean homolog of ANAC042 and is required for full elicitation of glyceollins. The results suggest a conserved phytoalexin elicitation pathway for phenylpropanoid-derived glyceollins in soybean and indole alkaloid-derived camalexin in Arabidopsis that requires NAC42 TFs. Further, our investigation of Lager\u2019s transcriptome dataset [65] demonstrated that ANAC042 and its target camalexin biosynthesis genes (namely CYP71A12, CYP71A13 and CYP71B15/PAD3) [7] were upregulated by long-term acidity stress, suggesting that NAC42-dependent induction of phytoalexins may be a conserved response to acidity stress.More insight into the NAC42 pathway could be drawn from the fact that glyceollin biosynthesis was elicited by the treatment of soybean cotyledons with hydroxyl radical (a ROS) [24] and camalexin elicitation by the ROS-inducing herbicide acifluorofen required ANAC042 [7]. The ROS-inducing herbicide lactofen systemically primes glyceollin biosynthesis [59]. ROS accumulation is stimulated by various phytoalexin elicitors such as pathogens, heavy metals, and UV irradiation [66\u201368]. Further, the acidification of growth media from pH\u20095.0 to 4.5 stimulated ROS production in seedlings of barley and Scots pine [69, 70] and in MS medium containing Plantago shoots [71]. Also, genes that positively regulate ROS (GO:2000377 and GO:2000379) were overrepresented in the soybean and Arabidopsis transcriptome responses to long-term acidity stress. Thus, the NAC42 pathway may be a conserved ROS signaling pathway responsible for phytoalexin elicitation in response to various abiotic and biotic elicitors. It is tempting to speculate that major TFs that regulate acidity and dehydration responses may regulate GmNAC42\u20131 since the stresses oppositely regulate GmNAC42\u20131 transcripts. STOP1 is a zinc finger TF that is a major regulator of protective responses to acidity stress [72, 73]. STOP1 also stimulates ROS production [74]. Yet, STOP1 homologs were not found in the soybean transcriptome response to long-term acidity stress (9 dat), and ANAC042 was not downregulated in an Arabidopsis stop1 mutant at 1 dat [72]. This could infer that NAC42 induction of phytoalexins is downstream of ROS signaling and not directly regulated by STOP1. ABA is a major regulator of dehydration responses in part through the activity of ABA-responsive element (ABRE)-binding TFs [75]. Our transcriptome dataset shows that dehydration is a powerful negative regulator of glyceollin biosynthesis and GmNAC42\u20131, raising the possibility that both are negatively regulated by ABA. We found that ABREs were present in the promoter regions (~\u20091000\u2009bp upstream of the transcription start site) of several glyceollin biosynthesis genes, but no ABREs were observed in the GmNAC42\u20131 promoter (data not shown). Thus, dehydration may regulate glyceollin biosynthesis at multiple levels.Phytoalexin TF genes of the NAC, MYB, bHLH, and WRKY families have been identified from Arabidopsis, rice, cotton, maize and grapevine [5\u201310]. Yet none of these TF genes were homologous among plant species. The phytoalexins elicited in these species were biosynthetically diverse and included indole alkaloids, momilactones and phytocassanes, terpenoid aldehydes, deoxyanthocyanidins, and stilbenoids, respectively. Thus, it has remained a question whether any phytoalexin TFs are conserved in plants or whether they are as diverse as the biosynthetic pathways that they regulate. Here, we found that GmNAC42\u20131 is required for the full activation of glyceollin biosynthesis in soybean. Its homolog ANAC042 is needed for the full elicitation of camalexin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis [7]. Glyceollins are isoflavonoid derivatives derived from phenylalanine, whereas camalexin is an indole alkaloid biosynthesized from tryptophan. It is possible that NAC42 TFs regulate genes in the shikimate pathway that produces phenylalanine and tryptophan. Yet, our overexpression and silencing experiments demonstrated that GmNAC42\u20131 regulated isoflavonoid- and glyceollin-specific biosynthetic genes through the direct binding of their promoters. While our promoter sequence analyses identified the putative NAC-binding element T/ATTGACT/C within 1\u2009kb of the translation start sites of the camalexin-specific biosynthetic genes CYP71A12 and CYP71A13 that were regulated at the mRNA level by ANAC042 [7], the DREB2A element that was suggested to be the target of ANAC042/JUB1 [76] was not found in those regions nor within glyceollin biosynthetic gene promoters. If NAC42 TFs indeed bind the element T/ATTGACT/C element in glyceollin- and camalexin-specific biosynthetic genes, this would suggest that phytoalexin biosynthesis pathways were co-opted into stress-inducible regulation by NAC42 TFs. Our future work will focus on characterizing the recognition elements and DNA binding domains of GmNAC42\u20131 and ANAC042 that are required to activate phytoalexin biosynthesis.GmNAC42\u20131 is essential for the full elicitation of glyceollins in soybean. It\u2019s overexpression in elicited soybean hairy roots enhanced the biosynthesis of glyceollins more than 10-fold. Thus, bioengineering the expressions of GmNAC42\u20131 may be a promising approach for bioproducing glyceollins for medicinal use or for enhancing soybean resistance to the economically destructive pathogen P. sojae. GmNAC42\u20131 is the first identified conserved regulator of phytoalexin biosynthesis and is a homolog of the indole alkaloid phytoalexin regulator ANAC042 from Arabidopsis. Possible implications are that NAC42-type TF genes could be used in a wide variety of crop plants to enhance the bioproduction of medicinal metabolites or for improving crop resistance to pathogens.Arabidopsis Biological Resource CenterABA-responsive elementsilver nitrateAGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN 1allene oxide cyclase(+)-\u03b4-cadinene synthaseCup-shaped cotyledonCopper chlorideDimethylallyl diphosphateDry weightFalse discovery rateFLAVIN-DEPENDENT-MONOOXYGENASE1Fresh weightGlycinol:4-dimethylallyl diphosphate transferaseG4DT gene promoter segment1Germination and co-cultivationGene regulatory networkHairy root growthMethyl jasmonateMethylerythritol phosphateMurashige and SkoogNo apical meristemN-terminal GFP tagN-hydroxypipecolic acidPHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT4Phenylalanine ammonia lyase\nPythium aphanidermatum\nPipecolic acidquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactionRNA Integrity NumberRNA interferenceRNA sequencingReactive oxygen speciesResistant to P. sojaeSystemic acquired resistanceSynthetic dropout medium lacking histidineSIGMA FACTOR BINDING PROTEIN 1STILBENE SYNTHASETranscription factorWall glucan elicitorYeast one-hybrid3-amino-1,2,4-triazoleArabidopsis transcription activation factorNAM/ATAF1/2/CUC2Oryza sativa jasmonic acid-amido synthetaseThis work was supported by WVU start-up funds to NK and was based upon work that is supported by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch, accession number 1010200, and the West Virginia Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station project WVA00687.All RNA-seq data are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under the series accession GSE112584.Not applicable.No applicable.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.To gain insight into how abiotic stresses regulate glyceollin biosynthesis in soybean we first searched for a control growth condition that would allow us to measure the inductive and suppressive effects of abiotic stress treatments on glyceollin biosynthesis. We grew soybean seedlings under two light intensities, 10 and 500\u2009\u03bcmol\u2009m\u2212\u20092\u2009s\u2212\u20091, which we refer to here as low and high light, respectively. We also compared seedlings grown on soil to those grown in liquid half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium that can be readily manipulated to provide nutrient and chemical stresses (see Methods). In addition to glyceollins, we also measured the levels of two key biosynthetic intermediates, two additional phytoalexins that have potent anti-pathogenic and/or medicinal activities, and two constitutively biosynthesized isoflavone-glycoside conjugates known to compete with glyceollins for biosynthetic intermediates. Specifically, we measured the levels of glyceollin I, glyceollin II, glyceollin III, and phaseol that are biosynthesized from the intermediate daidzein, and \u03b2prenyl genistein that is biosynthesized from genistein (Fig.\u00a01). We also measured the levels of an unknown metabolite that exhibited UV absorbance properties similar to isoflavonoids but did not represent any of the 57 (iso)flavonoid standards that we have in our library.\n\nFig. 1\nSoybean isoflavonoid biosynthetic pathway. Inducible phytoalexins (highlighted in blue) and constitutively biosynthesized isoflavone conjugates (highlighted in black) are derived from the isoflavone intermediates daidzein or genistein.

The MS low light condition had greater amounts of glyceollins I and II but lacked phaseol and Bprenyl-genistein, and thus may not be suitable for evaluating the specificity of the effects of abiotic stresses on the glyceollin pathway. Glyceollins were absent or in trace amounts in seedlings grown on soil, either under the high or low light conditions. Based on these results, we selected the MS medium high light as the control condition to evaluate the effects of abiotic stresses on glyceollin biosynthesis.\n\nFig. 2\nPhytoalexin and isoflavonoid content in response to abiotic stresses. a Effects of light and growth medium on phytoalexin elicitation in Harosoy 63 seedlings.

In contrast, \u03b2prenyl-genistein rapidly decreased up to 3 dat then remained constant thereafter. Two elicitation patterns distinguished pH\u20093.0 medium from the control. Glyceollin III and phaseol exhibited sharp increases from 6 dat to 9 dat, whereas glyceollins I and II exhibited delayed and prolonged accumulation (Fig. 3a). Elicitation of these daidzein-derived phytoalexins was accompanied by decreases in daidzein and its glycosyl-conjugates, namely daidzin and 6-O-malonyldaidzin. Genistein and derived isoflavonoids were not increased by pH\u20093.0 medium. In sharp contrast, dehydration caused a sustained suppression of all daidzein-derived isoflavonoids over the 9 d period with up to a 106.8-fold suppression of glyceollin I at 6 dat (Fig. 3a). This major suppressive effect was not observed for genistein-derived metabolites.\n\nFig. 3\nTime course of phytoalexin and isoflavonoid biosynthesis during acidity and dehydration stresses. a Isoflavonoid levels by UPLC-PDA over time after transfer to the control condition, pH\u20093.0 medium, or dehydration stress.

By comparing the two gene lists, we found that 1058 genes were in common (Fig.\u00a04a & Additional\u00a0file\u00a05: Table S5). All 27 known glyceollin biosynthesis genes spanning from phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) to the glycinol:dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) transferases G4DT and G2DT [37, 38] were upregulated by pH\u20093.0 medium and downregulated by dehydration, respectively (Table\u00a01). Since DMAPP is derived from either the cytosolic mevalonate pathway or the plastidic methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, we checked our lists for these genes. pH\u20093.0 and dehydration stresses oppositely regulated genes for all steps of the MEP pathway up to DMAPP formation, whereas no mevalonate genes were differentially regulated (Table 1).\n\nFig. 4\nComparative transcriptomics of seedlings treated with acidity stress or dehydration. a Number of genes in Harosoy 63 seedlings that were upregulated and downregulated more than 2-fold by pH\u20093.0 medium and dehydration, respectively (P\u2009<\u20090.05) by RNA-seq. b Percent of genes upregulated by pH\u20093.0 medium and downregulated by dehydration stress assigned to a category of gene ontology. c Breakdown of the \u2018Signal transduction\u2019 category into gene ontologies. Ontology analysis was conducted using the SoyBase Gene Model Data Mining and Analysis tool\nTable 1\nGlyceollin biosynthesis genes upregulated by pH\u20093.0 medium and downregulated by dehydration\nTo better understand the pathways that were oppositely regulated by acidity and dehydration stresses, we analyzed the ontologies of the 1058 oppositely regulated genes (Fig. 4a). Signal transduction was the most common category of ontology (31.4% of genes, Fig. 4b). When the signal transduction category was broken down into ontologies, the greatest proportion (28.3%) were annotated as systemic acquired resistance (SAR) (Fig. 4c). SAR is a component of the plant immune system whereby tissues distant from a pathogen infection site become primed (sensitized) to more rapidly activate resistance responses the second time the plant encounters the pathogen. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis indicated that SAR genes were significantly enriched (P\u2009<\u20091.0\u2212\u200910) and included those involved of salicylic acid (SA)-dependent and independent signaling pathways, in addition to jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene signaling pathways (GO:0009627, GO:0009862, GO:0009864, GO:0009871, and GO:0010112). The SAR genes included homologs of AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN 1 (ALD1) and FLAVIN-DEPENDENT-MONOOXYGENASE1 (FMO1) that were indispensable for SAR in Arabidopsis (Table\u00a02) [43\u201345]. ALD1 encodes an enzyme that synthesizes the non-protein amino acid pipecolic acid (Pip) from Lys upon pathogen attack [45]. FMO1 converts Pip to N-hydroxypipecolic acid (NHP) [46] and is needed for Pip to orchestrate priming of pathogen responses by SA-dependent and independent pathways [47]. The SAR genes also included homologs of signaling and TF genes that had roles in regulating the elicitation of the indole alkaloid phytoalexin camalexin in Arabidopsis. PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT4 (PAD4) is a lipase-like gene required for SA-dependent elicitation of camalexin in response to microbial pathogens [48]. SIGMA FACTOR BINDING PROTEIN 1 (SIB1) encodes a TF that activates the expression of AtWRKY33, a direct regulator of camalexin biosynthesis genes [49]. However, homologs of AtWRKY33 (namely Glyma.02G232600 and Glyma.14G200200) were not found in our gene set nor were they significantly upregulated by pH\u20093.0 medium alone.Table 2\nSelect SAR genes upregulated by pH\u20093.0 medium and downregulated by dehydration\nWe conducted qRT-PCR to gain insight into whether the NAC42-type TFs that were identified by our transcriptomics analysis may be involved in regulating glyceollin biosynthesis. qRT-PCR confirmed that the three GmNAC42s were upregulated by pH\u20093.0 medium and downregulated by dehydration (Fig.\u00a05a-b).\n\nFig. 5\nGmNAC42s expressions are induced with glyceollins in response to abiotic and biotic elicitors. a, b Gene expressions following treatment with pH\u20093.0 medium at 9 dat or dehydration at 6 dat relative to their respective controls measured by qRT-PCR. aSignificantly greater and bsignificantly less than control, paired students t-test (P\u2009<\u20090.01). c Unrooted phylogenetic tree of GmNAC42 amino acid sequences and characterized NACs.

These early metazoans are interesting, because they can give us important information on the evolution of various tissues and organs, such as eyes and the nervous system. Generally, cnidarians have simple nervous systems, which use neuropeptides for their neurotransmission, but some cnidarian medusae belonging to the class Cubozoa (box jellyfishes) have advanced image-forming eyes, probably associated with a complex innervation. Here, we describe a new transcriptome database from the cubomedusa Tripedalia cystophora.Based on the combined use of the Illumina and PacBio sequencing technologies, we produced a highly contiguous transcriptome database from T. cystophora. We then developed a software program to discover neuropeptide preprohormones in this database. This script enabled us to annotate seven novel T. cystophora neuropeptide preprohormone cDNAs: One coding for 19 copies of a peptide with the structure pQWLRGRFamide; one coding for six copies of a different RFamide peptide; one coding for six copies of pQPPGVWamide; one coding for eight different neuropeptide copies with the C-terminal LWamide sequence; one coding for thirteen copies of a peptide with the RPRAamide C-terminus; one coding for four copies of a peptide with the C-terminal GRYamide sequence; and one coding for seven copies of a cyclic peptide, of which the most frequent one has the sequence CTGQMCWFRamide. We could also identify orthologs of these seven preprohormones in the cubozoans Alatina alata, Carybdea xaymacana, Chironex fleckeri, and Chiropsalmus quadrumanus. Furthermore, using TBLASTN screening, we could annotate four bursicon-like glycoprotein hormone subunits, five opsins, and 52 other family-A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which also included two leucine-rich repeats containing G protein-coupled receptors (LGRs) in T. cystophora. The two LGRs are potential receptors for the glycoprotein hormones, while the other GPCRs are candidate receptors for the above-mentioned neuropeptides.By combining Illumina and PacBio sequencing technologies, we have produced a new high-quality de novo transcriptome assembly from T. cystophora that should be a valuable resource for identifying the neuronal components that are involved in vision and other behaviors in cubomedusae.Cnidarians are basal, multicellular animals such as Hydra, corals, and jellyfishes. They are interesting from an evolutionary point of view, because they belong to a small group of phyla (together with Placozoa, Ctenophora, and Porifera) that evolved before the split of deuterostomes (e.g. vertebrates) and protostomes (most invertebrates, such as insects), an event that occurred about 600 million years ago [1]. Cnidarians have an anatomically simple nervous system, which consists of a diffuse nerve net that sometimes is condensed (centralized) in the head or foot regions of polyps, or fused as a giant axon in polyp tentacles, or as a giant nerve ring in the bell margins of medusae [2\u201313].The nervous systems from cnidarians are highly peptidergic: A large number of cnidarian neuropeptides have been chemically isolated and sequenced from cnidarians and their preprohormones have been cloned [14\u201333].The cnidarian preprohormones often contain a high number of immature neuropeptide copies, ranging from 4 to 37 copies per preprohormone molecule [16\u201318, 20, 21, 23, 26, 27, 29, 33]. Each immature neuropeptide copy is flanked by processing signals: At the C-terminal sides of the immature neuropeptide sequences, these signals consist of the amino acid sequences GKR, GKK, or GR(R). The Arg (R) and Lys (K) residues are recognized by classical prohormone convertases (PC-1/3 or PC-2), which liberate the neuropeptide sequences, while the Gly (G) residues are converted into C-terminal amide groups by the enzyme peptidylglycine \u03b1-amidating monooxygenase [29, 34\u201336].At the N-terminal sides of the immature cnidarian neuropeptide sequences, we very often find a Gln (Q) residue, which is cyclized into a pyroglutamate group (pQ) and which protects the N-terminus of the neuropeptide against enzymatic degradation [16\u201318, 20, 21, 29]. In contrast to higher metazoans, however, the N-terminal processing sites preceding these Q residues are normally not dibasic residues, but often acidic (E or D) residues, or T, S, N, L, or V residues, suggesting the existence of novel endo- or aminopeptidases carrying out processing of cnidarian preprohormones [16\u201318, 20, 29]. These findings make it sometimes difficult to predict the N-terminus of a mature neuropeptide sequence from a cloned neuropeptide preprohormone. If a Q residue is found N-terminally of a PC 1/3 cleavage site preceded by acidic (E, D) or T, S, N, L or V residues, cleavage probably occurs N-terminally of this Q residue, yielding a protecting N-terminal pyroglutamate residue.Cnidarian neuropeptides have a broad spectrum of biological activities, including stimulation of the maturation and release of oocytes (spawning) in hydrozoan medusa, stimulation or inhibition of metamorphosis in hydrozoan planula larvae, stimulation of nerve cell differentiation in hydrozoan polyps, and stimulation or inhibition of smooth muscle contractions in hydrozoans and sea anemones [28, 32, 33, 37\u201346].In proto- and deuterostomes, neuropeptides normally act on G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are transmembrane proteins located in the cell membrane [47]. In cnidarians, one such GPCR has recently been identified (deorphanized) as the receptor for a hydromedusan neuropeptide that stimulates oocyte maturation [33]. GPCRs are metabotropic receptors that transmit their activation via second messengers and, because of the many steps involved, act relatively slowly. In cnidarians, however, some neuropeptides activate ionotropic receptors, such as the hydrozoan RFamide neuropeptides, which activate trimeric cell membrane channels belonging to the degenerin/epithelial Na+ channel (DEG/ENaC) family [48\u201352]. This peptidergic signal transmission via ligand-gated ion channels can be very fast.Cnidarians probably also use protein hormones for their intercellular signaling. Already 25\u2009years ago, we were able to clone a protein hormone receptor from sea anemones that was structurally closely related to mammalian glycoprotein receptors such as the ones that are activated by follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) [53, 54]. Glycoprotein hormones are normally heterodimers. Such dimer subunits, however, have not been identified from cnidarians, so far.Finally, cnidarians also use biogenic amines as neurotransmitters [55] and we have recently identified (deorphanized) a GPCR from Hydra magnipapilla that was a functional muscarinic acetylcholine receptor [56, 57]. The occurrence of this receptor gene, however, appears to be confined to hydrozoans and does not exist in other cnidarians [57].The phylum Cnidaria is generally subdivided into six classes: Hydrozoa (Hydra and colonial hydrozoans, such as Hydractinia), Anthozoa (such as sea anemones and corals), Scyphozoa (jellyfishes), Staurozoa (stalked jellyfishes), Cubomedusa (box jellyfishes), and Myxozoa (small obligate parasites). The nervous systems in animals belonging to these six classes all have the above-mentioned properties, for example they are all peptidergic, and their anatomy is diffuse with occasional centralizations [3\u201311]. However, many cubozoans, such as Tripedalia cystophora, have complex eyes, grouped together as six eyes on each of the four rhopalia, of which two eyes (the upper and lower lens eyes) are camera-type, image-forming eyes. These lower lense eyes are even able to adjust their pupils to light intensity [58\u201361]. One can expect that the innervation of these eyes and their signal processing must be unusually complex compared to the more basal signal transmission, occurring in other non-cubozoan cnidarians.In our current paper, we are presenting a highly contiguous transcriptome database from T. cystophora, which was based on the combined use of Illumina and PacBio sequencing, that could help us to identify the neuronal components that are involved in the innervation and processing of vision in cubomedusae. We have also compared the quality of our transcriptome with that of other cubozoan transcriptomes, which showed that our transcriptome was of high quality. Finally, we have tested the transcriptome and identified a set of novel genes involved in peptidergic neurotransmission.We isolated RNA from 12\u2009T. cystophora medusae, converted it into cDNA, and sequenced it, using the PacBio (Pacific Biosciences) sequencing technology (Additional file 1A-D). Comparison of this PacBio database with the Illumina reads (see below) gave us the information that some transcripts were missing in the PacBio database. We, therefore, carried out a second PacBio sequencing round of the same T. cystophora cDNA sample as mentioned above with the expectation that this would improve the completeness of the combined PacBio data set (Additional file 2A-C). All parameters in this second sequencing round were the same as in the first round. This second sequencing round improved our dataset considerably. In the following we give the combined data from the first and second sequencing rounds: Reads of interest (ROI; for definition see Additional file 1A), 645,865; containing 275,377 (42.64%) full length non-chimeric transcripts. After the Quiver polishing procedure (see Methods) we ended up with 88,588 high quality transcripts (mean quality index >\u20090.99) and 106,394 low quality transcripts (mean quality index of 0.30). For length distribution of ROI\u2019s and the definition of quality index, see Additional files 1A and 2A. The coverage of the high quality pool was 44 reads/transcript, while the coverage of the low quality pool was 9 reads/transcript (for further details, see Additional files 2A-C). We ended up with 46,348 unique transcripts (also called unigenes) after redundancy removal. A PacBio pipeline output summary is given in Additional file 2C.We also sequenced around 223 million paired-end reads from the Illumina X Ten platform, using T. cystophora cDNA derived for the same sample as the PacBio data. Around 204 million clean reads were generated, of which 99.3% had a base accuracy of 99 and 97.7% reads had a base accuracy of 99.9%. For an RNA-Seq pipeline outcome summary and quality assessment see Additional file 3. These short reads were subsequently used for correcting the PacBio consensus isoform sequences following two error correction pipelines, Proovread and LoRDEC (long read de Bruijn graph error correction) [62, 63] (see Additional file 4A and B).In Additional file 5A-E we have compared the assembled transcripts of our T. cystophora transcriptome with those from other eukaryotes. From a Venn diagram (Additional file 5E), which can be regarded as an estimate of transcript assembly quality, one can conclude that from the 46,348 unigenes (transcripts) present in our database, 23,286 unigenes had universally conserved ortholog genes in common with the SwissProt, InterPro, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and Eukaryotic Orthologue Group databases (=50%). These numbers compare well with other transcriptome databases.Most cnidarian neuropeptide preprohormones have basic cleavage sites (KR, RR) at the C-terminal parts of their immature neuropeptide sequences, preceded by a glycine (G) residue, which, after cleavage of the preprohormone, is converted into a C-terminal amide group [21, 29]. Furthermore, cnidarian preprohormones very often have multiple copies of the immature neuropeptide sequences [21, 29]. Therefore, we wrote a software program in Python3 that was based on these preprohormone features and that only filtered protein-coding sequences from the transcriptome database that contained at least three similar amino acid sequences, each ending with the sequence GKR, GKK, or GR. The flow chart of our program is given in Additional\u00a0file\u00a06 and the software is given in Additional\u00a0file\u00a07. Furthermore, we have deposited our software at [64].One complete preprohormone (having both a signal sequence and a stop codon in its cDNA) containing 19 copies of the neuropeptide sequence pQWLRGRFamide (named Tcy-RFamide-1) and one copy of pQFLRGRFamide (named Tcy-RFamide-2) is present in the database from T. cystophora (Fig.\u00a01, Table\u00a01). It is interesting that, like in other cnidarian RFamide preprohormones [21, 29], these neuropeptide sequences are very often preceded by acidic (D or E) residues, suggesting that these residues are processing sites and that the proposed neuropeptide sequences are correct.Similarly, we found a complete RFamide preprohormone in the transcriptome database from A. alata [65] that contained 18 copies of the neuropeptide pQWLRGRFamide, which is identical to Tcy-RFamide-1 (Fig. 1, Table 1). Also here, most neuropeptide sequences are preceded by acidic (D, E) residues, while two sequences are preceded by S residues (Fig. 1).In the transcriptome database from the cubomedusa Carybdea xaymacana, we could identify an incomplete RFamide preprohormone (lacking the signal sequence) that contained 11 copies of a neuropeptide sequence that was identical to Tcy-RFamide-1 (Fig. 1, Table 1). This incompleteness of the preprohormone was likely due to multiple gaps present in the C. xaymacana Illumina transcriptome.Similarly, the transcriptome assembly from the cubomedusa Chiropsalmus quadrumanus contained an incomplete preprohormone, having one copy of a neuropeptide identical to Tcy-RFamide-1 (Fig. 1, Table 1).Finally, the transcriptome database from the cubomedusa Chironex fleckeri contained one incomplete preprohormone sequence coding for seven RFamide neuropeptides that were identical to Tcy-RFamide-1 (Fig. 1, Table 1). Three of these neuropeptide sequences were preceded by acidic residues, while three of them were preceded by K and one by G (Fig. 1).We discovered a second potential RFamide preprohormone in our T. cystophora database named Tcy-RFamide-II (Additional\u00a0file\u00a08, Table 1). This preprohormone is complete, including a signal peptide, but we are unsure about the final mature structures of the biologically active peptides. Because PC 1/3-mediated processing could occur in between the RRR sequences (Additional file 8), the most likely products are six copies of RFamide. These RFamide sequences are very short compared to other known neuropeptides. For example, the shortest mammalian neuropeptide known is the tripeptide thyrotropin-releasing-hormone (TRH), pQHPamide [66], which, in contrast to the RFamide peptide, is N-terminally protected. We are, therefore, skeptical about the preprohormone status of Tcy-RFamide-II.A similar preprohormone as Tcy-RFamide-II can be identified in the A. alata database. Because this database only consists of Illumina reads, the complete preprohormone was difficult to assemble and the protein remained, therefore, incomplete (Additional file 8, Table 1).No RFamide-II preprohormones could be identified in the transcriptome databases from the other cubomedusae.In our T. cystophora transcriptome we could annotate a complete preprohormone that contained six copies of the proposed neuropeptide pQPPGVWamide (named Tcy-VWamide-1; Fig.\u00a02, Table 1). Five of these neuropeptide sequences are preceded by either S or T residues, a phenomenon that we observed earlier [21, 29] suggesting, again, processing at unusual amino acid residues.A preprohormone that contained six copies of a neuropeptide that was identical to Tcy-VWamide-1 could also be annotated from the transcriptome of A. alatina (Fig.\u00a04, Table 1). Also here, most neuropeptide sequences are preceded by either S or T residues, suggesting unusual processing.Also, in the transcriptome of C. xaymacana we could identify a complete preprohormone that contained five copies of a neuropeptide identical to Tcy-VWamide-1 (Fig. 2, Table 1).In addition, we could identify an incomplete preprohormone in the transcriptome from C. fleckeri that contained four neuropeptide copies identical to Tcy-VWamide-1. This precursor might also contain two other neuropeptide sequences that are different from Tcy-VWamide-1 (Fig. 2, Table 1).We could not find a VWamide preprohormone in the transcriptome of C. quadrumanus, probably due to insufficient sequencing depth.We could annotate a complete preprohormone in T. cystophora (named Tcy-LWamide) that contained seven neuropeptide copies with the C-terminal amino acid sequence LWamide and one copy of a peptide with the C-terminal MWamide sequence (Fig.\u00a03, Table 1). For this preprohormone, it is difficult to predict the N-termini of each neuropeptide sequence, due to the uncertainties of N-terminal neuropeptide processing (Fig. 3, Table 1; see, however, below).A similar complete preprohormone can be predicted from the transcriptome of A. alata (Fig. 3, Table 1), which has six copies of an LWamide, one copy of a MWamide, and one copy of an IWamide neuropeptide.The transcriptomes from C. xaymacana, and C. fleckeri only contain incomplete fragments of an LWamide preprohormone, having one to three copies of the LWamide or MWamide neuropeptides (Fig. 3, Table 1).When we aligned the LWamide preprohormones from the four cubomedusa species, we could see that they contained descrete LWamide or MWamide peptide subfamilies that were lying in a certain order from the N- to the C-termini. For example, peptide-2 (the second peptide from the N-terminus) in the preprohormones from T. cystophora, A. alata, C. xaymacana, and C. fleckeri always had the sequence ELQPGMWamide. When we would accept the existence of a hypothetical aminopeptidase processing C-terminally from the L residue [21], this subfamily would consist of four identical copies of pQPGMWamide (Table\u00a02). Thus, each cubomedusan species would contain one copy of this predicted peptide situated at peptide position-2 of the LWamide preprohormone. Peptide-3 (the third peptide from the N-terminus) always had the sequence A(or S)L(or M)VR(or K, or Q)PR(or K)LNL(or M)LWamide. This, then, is again a discrete peptide subfamily with a PRL or PKL core and an LWamide C-terminus (Table 2). Peptides-4 and -5, however (the fourth and fifth peptide from the N-terminus) have the C-terminus PR(or K)L(or M, V, or A)GLWamide and appear, therefore, to be related to each other (Table 2). Peptide-6 (the sixth peptide from the N-terminus in the preprohormone) always has the C-terminal sequence PGKVGLWamide, which is different from the peptides located at the other positions (Table 2). In conclusion, discrete sequence signatures can be recognized in the peptide subfamilies positioned at peptide positions 1, 2, 3, 4/5, and 6 (Table 2). We call the peptides belonging to these subfamilies peptide-1 to \u2212\u20096 and not LWamide-1 to \u2212\u20096, because the peptides belonging to family-2 have the C-terminus MWamide.Because of these discrete sequence signatures, the preprohormone fragments from C. xaymacana and C. fleckeri (Fig. 3) can easily be identified as a fragment containing (counted from the N- to the C-terminus) one copy of a peptide-2, \u2212\u20093, and\u2009\u2212\u20094 (C. xaymacana); and a fragment containing one copy of a peptide-2 and -3 sequence (C. fleckeri).In the transcriptome from T. cystophora we could annotate a complete preprohormone (name: Tcy-RAamide; Fig. 4) that contained thirteen copies of an RPRAamide neuropeptide, three copies of a PRSamide, and one copy of a PRGamide neuropeptide. In two cases (pQPRSamide, the first peptide, and pQVLTRPRGamide, the fourth peptide sequence counted from the N-terminus of the preprohormone, Fig. 4), the mature structures of the neuropeptide sequences can be readily predicted, because their Q residues are preceded by an acidic (E) or basic (R) residue, while for the other neuropeptide sequences the N-termini are uncertain (Fig. 4, Table 1).A similar complete RAamide preprohormone can be identified in the transcriptome from A. alatina (named Aal-RAamide, Fig. 4, Table 1). This preprohormone contains fourteen copies of a neuropeptide with the C-terminal sequence RPRAamide and three copies of a neuropeptide with a QPRGamide C-terminus. These last three peptides might have the mature structure pQPRGamide, while the N-termini of the other peptides are uncertain (Fig. 4).In the transcriptome from C. xaymacana, C. quadrumanus, and C. fleckeri, we identified incomplete RAamide preprohormone fragments that contained between one and three copies of an RAamide or RSamide neuropeptide (Fig. 4, Table 1). One of the peptides located on the second preprohormone fragment from C. quadrumanus (Fig. 4) is preceded by an acidic residue and has the likely structure pQPRSamide (Table 1).We identified a complete RYamide preprohormone (named Tcy-RYamide) in the transcriptome from T. cystophora that contained four copies of an RYamide neuropeptide.The first peptide located near the N-terminus of the preprohormone (Fig.\u00a05) (named Tcy-RYamide-1) has the likely sequence TPPWVKGRYamide and is protected at its N-terminus by the two proline residues at positions 2 and 3 (protective imide bonds between residues 1 and 2, and 2 and 3) (Tables 1 and 3). The second peptide counted from the N-terminus of the preprohormone has the sequence pQMWHRQRYamide (named Tcy-RYamide-2) and is protected at its N-terminus by a pyroglutamate residue (Fig. 5, Tables 1 and 3). The third peptide counted from the N-terminus has the likely sequence APGWHHGRYamide (named Tcy-RYamide-3) and is N-terminally protected by its proline residue at amino acid position-2 (Fig. 5, Tables 1 and 3). The fourth peptide counted from the N-terminus has the probable sequence TPLWAKGRYamide and is protected at its N-terminus by the proline residue at amino acid position-2 (Fig. 5, Table 1 and 3).In the transcriptome from A. alatina we could also annotate a complete preprohormone that was very similar to the RYamide preprohormone from T. cystophora (Fig. 5). When counted from the N- to the C-terminus of this preprohormone, we could identify a peptide-1 that was nearly identical to Tcy-RYamide-1; a peptide-2 that was nearly identical to Tcy-RYamide-2; a peptide-3 that was completely identical to Tcy-RYamide-3: and a peptide-4 that was nearly identical to Tcy-RYamide-4 (Fig. 5, Tables 1 and 3).In the transcriptome from C. xaymacana we could annotate an RY-amide preprohormone fragment that contained one copy of a peptide that was identical to Tcy-RYamide-3, and one that was very similar to Tcy-RYamide-4 (Fig. 5, Table 3).In the C. fleckeri transcriptome we could annotate an RYamide preprohormone fragment that contained one copy of a peptide that was very similar to Tcy-RYamide-2 (Fig. 5, Table 3).We could annotate a complete preprohormone in the Illumina Sequence Read Archive, SRA (NCBI accession number SRR779134), but not in the PacBio or Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA) database of T. cystophora that contains seven similar copies of an FRamide peptide (Fig.\u00a06, Table 1). Four copies have the probable sequence CTGQMCWFRamide (named Tcy-FRamide-1), two copies have the sequence CKGQMCWFRamide (Tcy-FRamide-2), and one copy has the sequence CVGQMCWFR-NH2 (Tcy-FRamide-3). It is interesting that these probable sequences contain a likely cystine bridge between the cysteine residues at positions 1 and 6 of the peptides, making them cyclic. The N-termini of the seven FRamide peptides, however, are somewhat uncertain and the proposed mature structures are based on a classical KR cleavage site preceding the sequence of the fifth copy counted from the N-terminus.A similar, complete preprohormone could be annotated in the transcriptome from A. alatina that contained six copies of an FRamide peptide (Fig. 6, Table 1). Two of these copies were identical to Tcy-FRamide-1, two other copies were identical to Tcy-FRamide-3, one copy was identical to Tcy-FRamide-2, while one copy had a new sequence CEGQMCWFRamide (Fig. 6, Table 1).We found an incomplete preprohormone fragment in the transcriptome from C. fleckeri that contained one copy of an FRamide peptide identical to Tcy-FRamide-1, and another one identical to Tcy-FRamide-2 (Fig. 6, Table 1). It is interesting that for all these proposed cubozoan FRamide peptides only the amino acid residues in position 2 were variable (being either T, K, V, or E), while the others were preserved.In this article we described a high-quality transcriptome database from the cubomedusa T. cystophora, which was constructed by the combined use of Illumina and PacBio sequences, and which we made freely accessible to global researchers (NCBI accession numbers SRR7791343-SRR7791345 and GGWE01000000). The longer PacBio sequences were needed for the correct assembly of the shorter Illumina sequences, especially when these Illumina sequences coded for neuropeptide preprohormones, which often contained repetitive sequences (see, for example, Table 1). The PacBio sequences were also needed for the correct annotations of full length GPCRs (Figs. 8, 9, and 10). The Illumina sequences, on the other hand, were necessary to correct for point mutations in the PacBio sequences. In addition, we developed a bioinformatics tool to search the transcriptome database for the presence of neuropeptide preprohormones, which turned out to be a highly versatile script and superior to ordinary TBLASTN searches, using neuropeptide sequences from bilaterian metazoans as queries. Finally, we tested the transcriptome database for its quality and completeness by annotating several components of peptidergic signaling and by comparing these results from our transcriptome with those from other freely accessible transcriptomes from cubozoans [65, 76, 77]. We identified the same number of neuropeptide preprohormone genes (seven) in the transcriptomes from T. cystophora, and A. alata, while we found six neuropeptide genes in the C. fleckeri transcriptome, five neuropeptide genes in the C. xaymacana transcriptome, and two neuropeptide genes in the C. quadrumanus transcriptome (Table 1, Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6). In most cases only incomplete preprohormone fragments could be identified in the transcriptomes from C. fleckeri, C. xaymacana, and C. quadrumanus, while always complete preprohormones (including a signal peptide and a stop codon) were identified in the transcriptome from T. cystophora, and with one exception in the transcriptome from A. alata (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6). These findings already suggest that the transcriptomes from T. cystophora and A. alata [65] are of much better quality (more complete) than the transcriptomes from C. fleckeri, C. xaymacana, and C. quadrumanus [76, 77].When we annotated GPCRs, we discovered 50 neuropeptide and biogenic amine GPCRs in the transcriptome from T. cystophora and 34 of these GPCRs in the transcriptome from A. alata (Table 4). For the LGRs, these numbers were two in the T. cystophora transcriptome and one in the A. alata transcriptome. For the opsins, we found five in the T. cystophora transcriptome and two in the A. alata transcriptome. These somewhat lower numbers of annotated GPCRs in the A. alata transcriptome [65] might be due to the fact that this transcriptome is only assembled from short Illumina transcripts, while our T. cystophora transcriptome also contains a large number of long PacBio transcripts with a length of up to 5000\u2009bp (Additional file 2A), which would favor the detection of longer proteins, such as GPCRs.The number of opsins (five) that we found in our transcriptome is lower than the number of opsin genes (eighteen: Tcop1-Tcop18) claimed by Liegertova et al. [74] to be present in the genome from T. cystophora. However, this last claim cannot be checked, because the genomic sequences from T. cystophora have not been made publicly available [74]. Our identified opsin Tcy 38276 (Fig. 9) is identical to the Tripedalia c-opsin cloned previously [75] and opsin Tc-neo [73]; it corresponds to the opsin gene Tcop18 [74]. Our opsin Tcy 32089 (Fig. 9) was cloned previously as the lens eye opsin Tc-leo [73] and corresponds to the opsin gene Tcop13 [74]. Tcy 9518 and Tcy 4539 (Fig. 9) correspond to the opsin genes Tcop5 and Tcop9, respectively [74]. The last of the five opsins that we identified, Tcy 37162 (Fig. 9), is new.The Tcy-RAamide preprohormone contains 13 copies of RPRAamide (Table 1). RPRAamide peptides and a corresponding preprohormone have recently been identified in the transcriptome from the hydrozoan C. pacificum [33], suggesting that also these neuropeptides might have a broad distribution.The last two preprohormones presented in Table 1, Tcy-RYamide and Tcy-FRamide (see also Fig. 5, and Fig. 6), are completely novel sequences and also their neuropeptide constituents have not been published earlier. These results show that our T. cystophora transcriptome contains novel and highly useful data for understanding neurotransmission in cubozoa and possibly also in other cnidarians.As a next practical step, we will raise specific antisera against the major neuropeptides produced by the seven preprohormones (Table 1) and clarify which neuronal subpopulations can be stained by them. These experiments will certainly give us important information on the neuroanatomy of T. cystophora and will also tell us which of these peptidergic nerve nets will innervate the eyes.In conclusion, we are presenting a high-quality transcriptome from T. cystophora, which will be a useful resource for the scientific community to better understand the biology of early metazoans and the evolution of important tissues and organs, such as nervous systems and eyes.T. cystophora (Conant 1897) were cultured in 250\u2009l tanks with recycled sea water at 28\u2009\u00b0C and fed with Artemia salina once a day. The light: dark cycle was 8:16\u2009h. We sampled medusae of various stages with a bell diameter ranging between 3.5 and 9\u2009mm. A total of 12 medusae were collected after 48\u2009h of starvation.Total RNA was extracted using the NucleoSpin RNAIIkit (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany) following the manufacture\u2019s instruction. Total RNA was dissolved in RNase-free water and RNA integrity was verified by gel electrophoresis. The RNA concentration and purity was measured with a Nanodrop ND-2000 spectrophometer (NanoDrop products, Wilmington, DE, USA).Total RNA samples were shipped on dry ice to an affiliation of the Beijing Genome Institute (BGI Tech Solutions, Hong Kong) for library preparation, sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis (coordinated by BGI Tech Solutions, Shenzhen, China). Sample quality and RNA concentrations were checked using the Agilent model 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and approved for sequencing (RNA Integrity Number, RIN: 9.7, and 28S/18S: 1.7). 8.6 microgram RNA was used to construct two cDNA libraries separately. The PacBio Iso-Seq libraries with a size of 0-5\u2009kb (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA) were generated for sequencing on two SMRT cells and one RNA-Seq library was prepared for sequencing with Illumina X Ten (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).Additional file 4A and B give an overview of the PacBio sequencing procedures and data processing. The bioinformatic data processing and error corrections were conducted at Beijing Genome Institute (BGI Tech Solutions, Shenzhen, China) following the PacBio Iso-Seq De novo protocol. The raw reads generated from the SMRT (Single Molecule Real Time) pipeline were separated into FL (full length) non-chimeric, non-FL and chimeric ROI. The chimerae, which were artificial contatemers fusion genes, were removed by this step. The FL non-chimeric ROI\u2019s were defined as having the 5\u2032 prime, 3\u2032 prime-adapters and a polyA tail. The FL non-chimeric ROI\u2019s were assembled to generate transcripts of all FL non-chimeric and non-FL non-chimeric sequences. For each assembled transcript, the Quiver error self-correction (polishing) software was run [78]. These corrected transcripts were divided into a high quality (hq; expected accuracy \u226599%, or QV\u2009\u2265\u200930) and a low quality (lq; expected accuracy <\u200999%, due to insufficient coverage or rare transcripts) subset. Even though the error rate was reduced by this procedure, a further correction was performed using Illumina RNA-Seq reads from the same sample (see below) and two additional bioinformatic packages, proovread [62] and Long Read de Bruijn Graph Error Correction (LoRDEC) [63]. Default parameters applied in proovread were -t 5 -b 200 -e 0.4 -s 3 -T 4 and k-mers 21 and 25 were used in LoRDEC. For details on the bioinformatic pipeline see Additional\u00a0file\u00a04.Illumina sequencing was performed with the Illumina X Ten machine using standard procedures and FastQC tools [79, 80]. Raw reads were subjected to quality filtration [81]. The filtering procedure performed to obtain \u201cclean reads\u201d with a high quality score, included the following steps: 1) Reads with adaptor sequences were removed 2) Reads in which the percentage of unknown bases (N) >\u200910% were removed 3) Low quality reads consisting of more than 40% low quality bases (value \u22645) and having a Phred score less than 20, were also removed.We developed a software program to identify putative neuropeptides (Additional\u00a0files\u00a06 and 7). This program was compiled using Python3 [82]. Our software was based on recognizing and counting prohormone convertase processing sites in the amino acid sequence. Because many mature neuropeptides are amidated, the preprohormone often contains a C-terminal glycine before the basic amino acid processing sites. This was accounted for in the searches (e.g. searching for \u2018GKR\u2019, \u2018GKK\u2019 and \u2018GR\u2019 motifs). For each sequence from the TSA (transcriptome shotgun assembly), the sequence was translated into all 6 reading frames and split into possible open reading frames. In all of the open reading frames, the number of processing sites was counted. If there were at least 3 processing sites within an open reading frame, the putative neuropeptide sequences were aligned to assess the similarity of the mature peptides. The open reading frames with highly similar peptide sequences were then manually curated to reject further unlikely preprohormones that were not discarded during the automated screening. The flow chart of the program can be seen in Additional file 6. The code can be found at [64] and in Additional file 7. The presence of signal peptides was determined by SignalP 4.1 [83, 84]. We identified glycoprotein hormones and GPCRs in the T.cystophora and A.alata transcriptomes by homology based searches. These searches were done with known cnidarian and other invertebrate and vertebrate protein sequences as search queries using TBLASTN [85] with default settings.For phylogenetic tree analyses (Figs. 8, 9, 10), the protein sequences were aligned using t-coffee. The alignments were read and analyzed in PAUP* by neighbor joining using p-distance and bootstraps of 100 repeats. The majority rule consensus trees were visualized using iTOL. Only bootstrap values above 50 were given in the figures. For Fig. 7, the following accession numbers for the Drosophila sequences were used: Dmel-burs\u03b1, NP_650983; Dmel-burs\u03b2, NP_609712. For Fig. 8, the following accession numbers were used: Hma LGR1, XP_002155960; Hma LGR2, NP_001267732; Ael LGR, CAA82186; Nve LGR1, XP_001641580; Nve LGR2, XP_001635321; Nve LGR3, XP_001638153; Hsa FSHR, NP_000136; Hsa TSHR, NP_000360; Hsa LHR, NP_000224; Hsa LGR4, NP_060960; Hsa LGR5, NP_003658; Hsa LGR6, NP_001017403; Hsa LGR7, NP_067647; Hsa LGR8, AAL69324.

Furthermore, many of these preprohormones could also be detected in transcriptomes from other cubozoan species:(i)\nOne complete preprohormone (having both a signal sequence and a stop codon in its cDNA) containing 19 copies of the neuropeptide sequence pQWLRGRFamide (named Tcy-RFamide-1) and one copy of pQFLRGRFamide (named Tcy-RFamide-2) is present in the database from T. cystophora (Fig.\u00a01, Table\u00a01). It is interesting that, like in other cnidarian RFamide preprohormones [21, 29], these neuropeptide sequences are very often preceded by acidic (D or E) residues, suggesting that these residues are processing sites and that the proposed neuropeptide sequences are correct.\nSimilarly, we found a complete RFamide preprohormone in the transcriptome database from A. alata [65] that contained 18 copies of the neuropeptide pQWLRGRFamide, which is identical to Tcy-RFamide-1 (Fig. 1, Table 1). Also here, most neuropeptide sequences are preceded by acidic (D, E) residues, while two sequences are preceded by S residues (Fig. 1).\nIn the transcriptome database from the cubomedusa Carybdea xaymacana, we could identify an incomplete RFamide preprohormone (lacking the signal sequence) that contained 11 copies of a neuropeptide sequence that was identical to Tcy-RFamide-1 (Fig. 1, Table 1). This incompleteness of the preprohormone was likely due to multiple gaps present in the C. xaymacana Illumina transcriptome.\nSimilarly, the transcriptome assembly from the cubomedusa Chiropsalmus quadrumanus contained an incomplete preprohormone, having one copy of a neuropeptide identical to Tcy-RFamide-1 (Fig. 1, Table 1).\nFinally, the transcriptome database from the cubomedusa Chironex fleckeri contained one incomplete preprohormone sequence coding for seven RFamide neuropeptides that were identical to Tcy-RFamide-1 (Fig. 1, Table 1). Three of these neuropeptide sequences were preceded by acidic residues, while three of them were preceded by K and one by G (Fig. 1).\n\u00a0(ii)\nWe discovered a second potential RFamide preprohormone in our T. cystophora database named Tcy-RFamide-II (Additional\u00a0file\u00a08, Table 1). This preprohormone is complete, including a signal peptide, but we are unsure about the final mature structures of the biologically active peptides. Because PC 1/3-mediated processing could occur in between the RRR sequences (Additional file 8), the most likely products are six copies of RFamide. These RFamide sequences are very short compared to other known neuropeptides. For example, the shortest mammalian neuropeptide known is the tripeptide thyrotropin-releasing-hormone (TRH), pQHPamide [66], which, in contrast to the RFamide peptide, is N-terminally protected. We are, therefore, skeptical about the preprohormone status of Tcy-RFamide-II.\nA similar preprohormone as Tcy-RFamide-II can be identified in the A. alata database. Because this database only consists of Illumina reads, the complete preprohormone was difficult to assemble and the protein remained, therefore, incomplete (Additional file 8, Table 1).\nNo RFamide-II preprohormones could be identified in the transcriptome databases from the other cubomedusae.\n\u00a0(iii)\nIn our T. cystophora transcriptome we could annotate a complete preprohormone that contained six copies of the proposed neuropeptide pQPPGVWamide (named Tcy-VWamide-1; Fig.\u00a02, Table 1). Five of these neuropeptide sequences are preceded by either S or T residues, a phenomenon that we observed earlier [21, 29] suggesting, again, processing at unusual amino acid residues.\nA preprohormone that contained six copies of a neuropeptide that was identical to Tcy-VWamide-1 could also be annotated from the transcriptome of A. alatina (Fig.\u00a04, Table 1). Also here, most neuropeptide sequences are preceded by either S or T residues, suggesting unusual processing.\nAlso, in the transcriptome of C. xaymacana we could identify a complete preprohormone that contained five copies of a neuropeptide identical to Tcy-VWamide-1 (Fig. 2, Table 1).\nIn addition, we could identify an incomplete preprohormone in the transcriptome from C. fleckeri that contained four neuropeptide copies identical to Tcy-VWamide-1. This precursor might also contain two other neuropeptide sequences that are different from Tcy-VWamide-1 (Fig. 2, Table 1).\nWe could not find a VWamide preprohormone in the transcriptome of C. quadrumanus, probably due to insufficient sequencing depth.\n\u00a0(iv)\nWe could annotate a complete preprohormone in T. cystophora (named Tcy-LWamide) that contained seven neuropeptide copies with the C-terminal amino acid sequence LWamide and one copy of a peptide with the C-terminal MWamide sequence (Fig.\u00a03, Table 1). For this preprohormone, it is difficult to predict the N-termini of each neuropeptide sequence, due to the uncertainties of N-terminal neuropeptide processing (Fig. 3, Table 1; see, however, below).\nA similar complete preprohormone can be predicted from the transcriptome of A. alata (Fig. 3, Table 1), which has six copies of an LWamide, one copy of a MWamide, and one copy of an IWamide neuropeptide.\nThe transcriptomes from C. xaymacana, and C. fleckeri only contain incomplete fragments of an LWamide preprohormone, having one to three copies of the LWamide or MWamide neuropeptides (Fig. 3, Table 1).\nWhen we aligned the LWamide preprohormones from the four cubomedusa species, we could see that they contained descrete LWamide or MWamide peptide subfamilies that were lying in a certain order from the N- to the C-termini. For example, peptide-2 (the second peptide from the N-terminus) in the preprohormones from T. cystophora, A. alata, C. xaymacana, and C. fleckeri always had the sequence ELQPGMWamide. When we would accept the existence of a hypothetical aminopeptidase processing C-terminally from the L residue [21], this subfamily would consist of four identical copies of pQPGMWamide (Table\u00a02). Thus, each cubomedusan species would contain one copy of this predicted peptide situated at peptide position-2 of the LWamide preprohormone. Peptide-3 (the third peptide from the N-terminus) always had the sequence A(or S)L(or M)VR(or K, or Q)PR(or K)LNL(or M)LWamide. This, then, is again a discrete peptide subfamily with a PRL or PKL core and an LWamide C-terminus (Table 2). Peptides-4 and -5, however (the fourth and fifth peptide from the N-terminus) have the C-terminus PR(or K)L(or M, V, or A)GLWamide and appear, therefore, to be related to each other (Table 2). Peptide-6 (the sixth peptide from the N-terminus in the preprohormone) always has the C-terminal sequence PGKVGLWamide, which is different from the peptides located at the other positions (Table 2). In conclusion, discrete sequence signatures can be recognized in the peptide subfamilies positioned at peptide positions 1, 2, 3, 4/5, and 6 (Table 2). We call the peptides belonging to these subfamilies peptide-1 to \u2212\u20096 and not LWamide-1 to \u2212\u20096, because the peptides belonging to family-2 have the C-terminus MWamide.\nBecause of these discrete sequence signatures, the preprohormone fragments from C. xaymacana and C. fleckeri (Fig. 3) can easily be identified as a fragment containing (counted from the N- to the C-terminus) one copy of a peptide-2, \u2212\u20093, and\u2009\u2212\u20094 (C. xaymacana); and a fragment containing one copy of a peptide-2 and -3 sequence (C. fleckeri).\n\u00a0(v)\nIn the transcriptome from T. cystophora we could annotate a complete preprohormone (name: Tcy-RAamide; Fig. 4) that contained thirteen copies of an RPRAamide neuropeptide, three copies of a PRSamide, and one copy of a PRGamide neuropeptide. In two cases (pQPRSamide, the first peptide, and pQVLTRPRGamide, the fourth peptide sequence counted from the N-terminus of the preprohormone, Fig. 4), the mature structures of the neuropeptide sequences can be readily predicted, because their Q residues are preceded by an acidic (E) or basic (R) residue, while for the other neuropeptide sequences the N-termini are uncertain (Fig. 4, Table 1).\nA similar complete RAamide preprohormone can be identified in the transcriptome from A. alatina (named Aal-RAamide, Fig. 4, Table 1). This preprohormone contains fourteen copies of a neuropeptide with the C-terminal sequence RPRAamide and three copies of a neuropeptide with a QPRGamide C-terminus. These last three peptides might have the mature structure pQPRGamide, while the N-termini of the other peptides are uncertain (Fig. 4).\nIn the transcriptome from C. xaymacana, C. quadrumanus, and C. fleckeri, we identified incomplete RAamide preprohormone fragments that contained between one and three copies of an RAamide or RSamide neuropeptide (Fig. 4, Table 1). One of the peptides located on the second preprohormone fragment from C. quadrumanus (Fig. 4) is preceded by an acidic residue and has the likely structure pQPRSamide (Table 1).\n\u00a0(vi)\nWe identified a complete RYamide preprohormone (named Tcy-RYamide) in the transcriptome from T. cystophora that contained four copies of an RYamide neuropeptide.\nThe first peptide located near the N-terminus of the preprohormone (Fig.\u00a05) (named Tcy-RYamide-1) has the likely sequence TPPWVKGRYamide and is protected at its N-terminus by the two proline residues at positions 2 and 3 (protective imide bonds between residues 1 and 2, and 2 and 3) (Tables 1 and 3). The second peptide counted from the N-terminus of the preprohormone has the sequence pQMWHRQRYamide (named Tcy-RYamide-2) and is protected at its N-terminus by a pyroglutamate residue (Fig. 5, Tables 1 and 3). The third peptide counted from the N-terminus has the likely sequence APGWHHGRYamide (named Tcy-RYamide-3) and is N-terminally protected by its proline residue at amino acid position-2 (Fig. 5, Tables 1 and 3). The fourth peptide counted from the N-terminus has the probable sequence TPLWAKGRYamide and is protected at its N-terminus by the proline residue at amino acid position-2 (Fig. 5, Table 1 and 3).\nIn the transcriptome from A. alatina we could also annotate a complete preprohormone that was very similar to the RYamide preprohormone from T. cystophora (Fig. 5). When counted from the N- to the C-terminus of this preprohormone, we could identify a peptide-1 that was nearly identical to Tcy-RYamide-1; a peptide-2 that was nearly identical to Tcy-RYamide-2; a peptide-3 that was completely identical to Tcy-RYamide-3: and a peptide-4 that was nearly identical to Tcy-RYamide-4 (Fig. 5, Tables 1 and 3).\nIn the transcriptome from C. xaymacana we could annotate an RY-amide preprohormone fragment that contained one copy of a peptide that was identical to Tcy-RYamide-3, and one that was very similar to Tcy-RYamide-4 (Fig. 5, Table 3).\nIn the C. fleckeri transcriptome we could annotate an RYamide preprohormone fragment that contained one copy of a peptide that was very similar to Tcy-RYamide-2 (Fig. 5, Table 3).\n\u00a0(vii)\nWe could annotate a complete preprohormone in the Illumina Sequence Read Archive, SRA (NCBI accession number SRR779134), but not in the PacBio or Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA) database of T. cystophora that contains seven similar copies of an FRamide peptide (Fig.\u00a06, Table 1). Four copies have the probable sequence CTGQMCWFRamide (named Tcy-FRamide-1), two copies have the sequence CKGQMCWFRamide (Tcy-FRamide-2), and one copy has the sequence CVGQMCWFR-NH2 (Tcy-FRamide-3). It is interesting that these probable sequences contain a likely cystine bridge between the cysteine residues at positions 1 and 6 of the peptides, making them cyclic. The N-termini of the seven FRamide peptides, however, are somewhat uncertain and the proposed mature structures are based on a classical KR cleavage site preceding the sequence of the fifth copy counted from the N-terminus.\nA similar, complete preprohormone could be annotated in the transcriptome from A. alatina that contained six copies of an FRamide peptide (Fig. 6, Table 1). Two of these copies were identical to Tcy-FRamide-1, two other copies were identical to Tcy-FRamide-3, one copy was identical to Tcy-FRamide-2, while one copy had a new sequence CEGQMCWFRamide (Fig. 6, Table 1).\nWe found an incomplete preprohormone fragment in the transcriptome from C. fleckeri that contained one copy of an FRamide peptide identical to Tcy-FRamide-1, and another one identical to Tcy-FRamide-2 (Fig. 6, Table 1). It is interesting that for all these proposed cubozoan FRamide peptides only the amino acid residues in position 2 were variable (being either T, K, V, or E), while the others were preserved.\n\u00a0\n\nFig. 1\nAmino acid sequences of the RFamide preprohormone from T. cystophora (Tcy-RFamide), A. alata (Aal-RFamide), C. xaymacana (Cxa-RFamide), C. quadrumanus (Cqu-RFamide), and C. fleckeri (Cfl-RFamide). In the complete proteins, the signal peptides are underlined and the stop codons are indicated by asterisks. Prohormone convertase (PC 1/3) cleavage sites (KR, R, KK) are highlighted in green and the C-terminal G residues, which are converted into C-terminal amide groups by peptidyl-glycine \u03b1-amidating monooxygenase, are highlighted in red. The above-mentioned processing enzymes liberate peptide fragments (highlighted in yellow) with the C-terminal sequence RFamide. The N-termini of these peptides are determined by Q residues that we assume are converted into protective pyroglutamate residues (pQ) by the enzyme glutaminyl cyclase. These Q residues are often preceded by acidic residues (D or E), which are established processing sites in cnidarians, but not in higher metazoans [21, 29]. These actions would yield 19 copies of Tcy-RFamide-1 (pQWLRGRFamide), and one copy of Tcy-RFamide-2 (pQFLRGRFamide), which are N-terminally protected by pQ residues and C-terminally by amide groups (see also Table 1). In the Aal-RFamide preprohormone (second panel from the top) there are 18 copies of a peptide identical to Tcy-RFamide-1 (see also Table 1). These peptide sequences are preceded nearly exclusively by acidic (D and E) and occasionally by S residues. In the incomplete Cxa-RFamide preprohormone 11 copies of a peptide identical to Tcy-RFamide-1 are present (see also Table 1). Most peptide sequences are preceded by acidic residues, while two peptide sequences are preceded by S residues. From C. quadrumanus (fourth panel from the top) we could only identify a short incomplete preprohormone fragment, containing one copy of a peptide sequence identical to Tcy-RFamide-1. This copy is preceded by an acidic (E) residue. Finally, the incomplete C. fleckeri preprohormone (bottom panel) contains seven copies of a peptide identical to Tcy-RFamide-1. Most copies are preceded by acidic residues, while one copy is preceded by a G and other copies by K residues\nTable 1\nAnnotated preprohormones and their predicted mature neuropeptide sequences\n\n\nFig. 2\nAmino acid sequences of the complete VWamide preprohormone from T. cystophora, A. alata, C. xaymacana, and C. fleckeri. Residues and peptide sequences are highlighted as in Fig. 1. The VWamide preprohormone from T. cystophora (named Tcy-VWamide) contains six copies of Tcy-VWamide-1 (pQPPGVWamide), which are preceded by wither S, T, or A residues. The VWamide preprohormone from A. alata contains six copies of a neuropeptide identical to Tcy-VWamide-1, which are preceded by either S, T, or R residues. The VWamide preprohormone from C. xaymacana contains five copies of Tcy-VWamide-1. Each copy is preceded by either S, or T residues. The VWamide preprohormone from C. fleckeri contains four copies of Tcy-VWamide-1, one copy of a peptide with the PAamide C-terminal sequence (pQSPAamide), and one copy of a peptide with the NWamide C-terminal sequence (pQGNWamide)\n\n\nFig. 3\nComplete or partial acid sequences of four LWamide preprohormones from T. cystophora, A. alata, C. xaymacana, and C. fleckeri. Residues and peptide sequences are highlighted as in Fig. 1. These preprohormones can be processed into a number of peptides with either the LWamide or MWamide C-terminus, while the N-termini of some of these peptides are somewhat uncertain (Table 1). Interestingly, the second neuropeptide sequence (counted from the N-terminus), pQPGMWamide, is completely identical in all four cubomedusan preprohormones. These sequences are preceded by L residues, which again would imply processing C-terminally from L [21, 29]. Similarly, the third peptide sequence (counted from the N-terminus) from each preprohormone constitute a peptide subfamily of nearly identical sequences. Table 2 gives our proposal for their structures, although there are uncertainties about their N-termini. The proposed peptide subfamilies have discrete structures, which enable us to identify the first peptide sequences in the C. xaymacana and C. fleckeri preprohormone fragments as peptides-2 (belonging to peptide family-2) followed by peptides-3 and -4\nTable 2\nDistinct LWamide neuropeptide subfamilies located on the cubomedusan LWamide preprohormones. These neuropeptide subfamilies are located at a certain order (last column) counted from the N- to C-termini of the preprohormones. Identical amino acid residues are highlighted in yellow, non-identical residues in grey\n\n\nFig. 4\nAmino acid sequences of the RAamide preprohormones from T. cystophora, A. alata, C. xaymacana, C. quadrumanus, and C. fleckeri. Residues and peptide sequences are highlighted as in Fig. 1. In T. cystophora, the preprohormone (named Tcy-RAamide) can be processed into 13 peptide copies with the C-terminal sequence RPRAamide, (named Tcy-RAamide-1), three copies with the sequence pQPRSamide (named Tcy-RSamide-1), and one copy with the sequence pQVLTRPRGamide (named Tcy-RGamide; see Table 1). In A. alata, the preprohormone (named Aal-RAamide) contains 14 peptide copies with the RPRAamide C-terminus, and three copies of pQPRGamide (Table 1). In C. xaymacana, we identified a small preprohormone fragment (named Cxa-RAamide) that contained two peptide copies with the RPRAamide C-terminal sequence, and one copy with the VPRAamide C-terminal sequence (Table 1). In the C. quadrumanus transcriptome we identified two small preprohormone fragments (probably part of one preprohormone named Cqu-RAamide) that contained two copies of a RPRAamide peptide and one peptide with the sequence pQPRSamide (Table 1). In C. fleckeri we identified a small preprohormone fragment (named Cfl-RAamide) that contained three copies of a peptide with the C-terminal sequence RPRAamide (Table 1)\n\n\nFig. 5\nAmino acid sequences of the RYamide preprohormones from T. cystophora, A. alata, C. xayamacana, and C. fleckeri. Residues and peptide sequences are highlighted as in Fig. 1. These preprohormones can be processed in a number of neuropeptides with the C-terminal RYamide sequences. Just like the LWamide preprohormones (Fig. 3), it is possible to group these peptides into four peptide subfamilies which, interestingly, are positioned at discrete locations on the medusa RYamide preprohormones (Table 3). At positions-1 (counted from the N- to the C-terminus) the the T. cystophora and A. alatina preprohormones contain two nearly identical RYamide neuropeptides (TPPWVKGRYamide, respectively TPPWIKGRYamide; see also Table 3). At positions-2 (counted from the N- to the C-terminus) the T. cystophora, A. alatina, and C. fleckeri preprohormones contained three highly similar neuropeptides, which in T. cystophora has the sequence pQMWHRQRYamide (see also Table 3). At positions-3 (counted from the N- to C-terminus), the preprohormones from T. cystophora, A. alata, and C. xaymacana each contains an identical neuropeptide with the sequence APGWHHGRYamide (see also Table 3). At positions-4, the preprohormones from T. cystophora, A. alata, and C. xaymacana contain sequences of closely related peptides of which the one in T. cystophora has the sequence TPLWAKGRYamide (see also Table 3). The four neuropeptide subfamilies have structural signatures (Table 3), which enable us to assign a peptide-3 (belonging to the third peptide subfamily) and a peptide-4 (belonging to the fourth peptide subfamily) on the preprohormone fragment from C. xaymacana and a peptide-2 (belonging to the second peptide subfamily) on the small preprohormone fragment from C. fleckeri\nTable 3\nDistinct neuropeptide subfamilies located on the RYamide preprohormones from different cubomedusan species. These neuropeptide subfamilies are located at discrete positions and counted from the N- to C-termini of the preprohormones. The amino acid residues are marked as in Table 2\n\n\nFig. 6\nAmino acid sequences of the FRamide preprohormones from T. cystophora, A. alata, and C. fleckeri. Residues and peptide sequences are highlighted as in Fig. 1. The T. cystophora preprohormone produces four copies of a neuropeptide with the sequence CTGQMCWFRamide (named Tcy-FRamide-1), two copies of CKGQMCWFRamide (Tcy-FRamide-2), and one copy of CVGQMCWFRamide (Tcy-FRamide-3). The preprohormone from A. alata produces two copies of a peptide identical to Tcy-FRamide-1, two copies of a peptide identical to Tcy-FRamide-3, one copy of a peptide identical to Tcy-FRamide-2, and one copy of CEGQMCWFRamide (Table 1). The preprohormone fragment from C. fleckeri contains one copy of a peptide identical to Tcy-FRamide-1 and one peptide copy identical to Tcy-FRamide-2 (Table 1). All peptides contained in the three preprohormones are nearly identical in structure and only vary in the second amino acid residue, being either T, K, V, or E\nTBLASTN screening using various mammalian and insect glycoprotein hormone sequences as a query identified four complete glycoprotein hormone subunits in our combined transcriptome database from T. cystophora (Fig.\u00a07). When we applied the same procedure to the transcriptome database from A. alata we could identify four orthologues to the T. cystophora glycoprotein hormone subunits (Fig. 7). Generally, glycoprotein hormone (GPH) subunits have eleven cysteine residues, of which 10 are used for intramolecular cystine bridges, while one (number 6 in Fig. 7) is used for connecting the two subunits to form a functional ligand. Figure\u00a07 shows that the four cubomedusan GPH subunits probably form the same cysteine bridges as the other metazoan GPHs, for example the two subunits from Drosophila bursicon.\n\nFig. 7\nAlignment of the amino acid sequences from the glycoprotein hormones (GPHs) identified in the transcriptomes from T. cystophora and A. alatina, together with the Drosophila bursicon-\u03b1 (Dme-burs\u03b1) and -\u03b2 (Dme-burs\u03b2) subunits. In T. cystophora, we discovered four glycoprotein hormone subunits (Tcy-GPH-1 to \u2212\u20094) and the same number was found in A. alatina (Aal-GPH-1 to \u2212\u20094). These subunits from one species can form hetero- or homodimers. Amino acid residues that were identical between two orthologues in the two cubomedusae are highlighted in the same color. Residues that are identical in all subunits are highlighted in yellow. GPHs are known to have five cystine bridges (presented as horizontal lines) formed by oxydation from ten cysteine residues (marked by vertical boxes). The star marks cysteine residue #6, which makes an intermolecular cystine bridge with the other subunit that is part of the dimer. It can be seen that the cystine bridges in the cubomedusan GPH and Drosophila bursicon subunits are probably the same. In addition, the cubomedusan subunits have several amino acid residues in common with the bursicon subunits, especially around cysteine residue #4. The sequences for Tcy-GPH-1 to \u2212\u20094 have been submitted to the GenBank Data Bank with accession numbers MH835330-MH835333\nThe presence of four glycoprotein hormone subunits (yielding at least two heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone ligands) in T. cystophora strongly suggests the presence of Leu-rich G protein-coupled receptors (LGRs), which in mammals, insects, and other invertebrates are the receptors for glycoprotein hormones [47, 67\u201370]. Furthermore, already in 1993, we cloned an LGR from sea anemones [53, 54], indicating that LGRs might be present in all cnidarians. Using the sea anemone LGR and several mammalian and insect LGRs as queries in a TBLASTN search, we were able to identify two LGR transcripts in the database from T. cystophora and one LGR in the transcriptome from A. alata (Table\u00a04, Fig.\u00a08, Additional\u00a0file\u00a09). Figure\u00a08b explains that LGRs can be classified into three types, type-A, -B, and -C, depending on specific domains in their extracellular N-termini [70]. These criteria identify the two T. cystophora LGRs as being type-A and -B, respectively (Fig. 8a). The single LGR from A. alata is a type-B LGR and an orthologue of the type-B LGR from T. cystophora. We assume that the absence of the A-type LGR family member in A. alata is due to insufficient coverage of the assembled transcriptome from this cubomedusa.Table 4\nOverview of the numbers of GPCRs identified in the transcriptomes from T. cystophora and A. alata\n\n\nFig. 8\nUpper panel: A phylogenetic tree analysis of the Leu-rich repeats containing G Protein-coupled receptors (LGRs) from T. cystophora, and A. alata, together with some selected LGRs from other cnidarians and humans. The tree is routed with the Drosophila mGlu receptor CG2114. Lower panel: A cartoon (modified from [70]), showing the characteristic features of the A-, B-, and C-type LGRs. In this cartoon the transmembrane region is highlighted in dark grey and the extracellular leucine-rich repeats in light grey (LGR types -A, -B and -C have a characteristic number of these repeats drawn as boxes). The yellow circles are cysteine-rich domains preceding the leucine-rich repeats. Type-C has a low-density lipoprotein domain (drawn as a hexagon) preceding these yellow-marked cysteine-rich domains. In between the leucine-rich repeats and the transmembrane regions are cysteine-rich domains that are specific for either the A-, B-, or C-type (given as green, orange, and blue circles) LGRs. According to these features, the T. cystophora Tcy-43231-LGR (the number refers to Additional file 9, \u201cLGRs\u201d) is an A-type LGR (highlighted in green), which clusters together with the A-type LGRs from the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima (Ael-LGR; [53]), Hydra magnipapillata (Hma_LGR1), and Nematostella vectensis (Nve-LGR1 and Nve-LGR3). The other T. cystophora LGR (Tcy-30226-LGR, see Additional file 9) is a B-type LGR (highlighted in orange) and clusters together with the B-type LGRs from A. alatina (Aal-61645-LGR, see Additional file 9), N. vectensis (Nve-LGR2), and H. magnipapilla (Hma-LGR2). Other abbreviations are: Hsa, H. sapiens; FSHR, follicle-stimulating-hormone receptor; LHR, luteinizing hormone receptor; TSHR, thyroid-stimulating-hormone receptor. Additional file 9 gives the GenBank Data Bank accession numbers for the cubomedusan LGRs. The accession numbers for the other LGR sequences are given in the Methods\nIt is known that cubomedusae and other cnidarians produce opsins [13, 61, 71\u201375]. We used cnidarian, and other invertebrate and vertebrate opsins as queries in a TBLASTN search of our T. cystophora transcriptome and found five different opsins (Fig.\u00a09 and Table 4). A similar screening of the A. alata transcriptome yielded two opsins, which were orthologues of two of the T. cystophora opsins (Fig. 9).\n\nFig. 9\nPhylogenetic tree analysis of four human opsins together with the five opsins identified in the transcriptome from T. cystophora (marked in yellow) and the two opsins from A. alata (marked in green). The tree has been rooted with the Drosophila mGlu receptor CG2114. The numbers given after the abbreviations Tcy and Aal refer to the ones given in Additional file 9. The T. cystophora opsin Tcy32089 is expressed in the lense-eye, supporting that it is a functional opsin [73]. It can be seen that two opsins from T. cystophora have close orthologues in A. alata. See additional file 9 for GenBank Data Bank accession numbers of the cubomedusan opsins, and Methods for the accession numbers of the human opsins\nWe used all Drosophila neuropeptide and biogenic amine GPCRs [47] as queries in TBLASTN searches of our T. cystophora transcriptome. In this way, we identified 22 GPCRs, which the TBLASTN search software described as neuropeptide GPCR-like and 28 GPCRs which the search software described as biogenic amine GPCR-like (Table 4). A similar TBLASTN search of the A. alatina transcriptome identified 22 neuropeptide GPCR-like receptors and 18 biogenic amine GPCR-like receptors. When we carried out a phylogenetic tree analysis of these receptors together with the T. cystophora and A. alata opsins and LGRs (see above), we found that the opsins and LGRs were sorted as discrete, structurally related clusters (Fig.\u00a010). For the receptors that the TBLASTN software identified as neuropeptide or biogenic amine GPCRs, however, no such homogeneous clustering could be observed and all receptors were distributed randomly (Fig.\u00a010). These results make it difficult to predict whether a certain GPCR is a neuropeptide or biogenic amine receptor.\n\nFig. 10\nPhylogenetic tree analysis of the family-A (rhodopsin-like) GPCRs discovered in the transcriptomes from T. cystophora and A. alata. The tree has been rooted with the Drosophila mGlu receptor CG2114. The opsins are highlighted in blue. The LGRs are highlighted in orange. When, during a TBLASTN search, the receptor was computer-identified as a neuropeptide GPCR, the cubomedusan GPCR was highlighted in yellow in this figure. Computer-identification as a biogenic amine GPCR let us to highlight these receptors in green. It can be seen that the computer-identified neuropeptide and biogenic amine GPCRs do not form two discrete clusters and, therefore, it is difficult to conclude that a certain receptor is a neuropeptide or biogenic amine receptor. See also Additional file 9 for GenBank Data Bank accession numbers\nSome of the neuropeptides that we predicted from the seven T. cystophora preprohormone cDNAs (Tables 1, 2 and 3) are identical or very similar to earlier chemically isolated and sequenced cnidarian neuropeptides. The Tcy-RFamide preprohormone (Table 1), for example, contains 19 copies of the predicted neuropeptide sequence pQWLRGRFamide (Tcy-RFamide-1), which is identical to the isolated and sequenced scyphozoan neuropeptide Cyanea-RFamide-I and very similar to the hydrozoan neuropeptides Pol-RFamide-II and Hydra-RFamide-I (Table\u00a05). The C-terminal GRFamide sequence has been found in isolated or cloned neuropeptides from every cnidarian species investigated so far and the GRFamide neuropeptide family, therefore, appears to be universal in Cnidaria. The Tcy-VWamide preprohormone (Table 1) produces six copies of the predicted neuropeptide pQPPGVWamide (Tcy-VWamide-1), which resembles a previously isolated sea anemone neuropeptide metamorphosin-A [19], and the Hydra neuropeptide Hym331/Hydra-LWamide-I [32] (Table\u00a06). Also, peptides belonging to the Tcy-LWamide preprohormone, such as peptides \u2212\u20094, \u2212\u20095, and\u2009\u2212\u20096 (Tables 1 and 2) clearly resemble metamorphosin-A, with which they have the C-terminal sequence GLWamide in common (Table 6). Preprohormones containing GLWamide peptides have recently been identified in the transcriptomes from the hydrozoans Clythia hemispheria and Cladonema pacificum [33]. Thus, like the GRFamides, also GLWamide neuropeptides appear to be widespread in cnidarians.Table 5\nAmino acid residue identities (highlighted in yellow) between Tcy-RFamide-1 and some chemically isolated and sequenced (\u201cestablished\u201d) cnidarian neuropeptides\nTable 6\nAmino acid residue identities (highlighted in yellow) between the isolated and sequenced sea anemone neuropeptide metamorphosin-A, the Hydra peptide Hym331, and some of the T. cystophora peptides contained in the Tcy-VWamide and Tcy-LWamide preprohormones (see Table 1)\n\n\nAdditional file 1:\nA: Quality assessment of PacBio data.

(XLSX 13 kb)", "s12864-019-5521-8": "Whilst information regarding small RNAs within agricultural crops is increasing, the miRNA composition of the nutritionally valuable pulse narrow-leafed lupin (Lupinus angustifolius) remains unknown.By conducting a genome- and transcriptome-wide survey we identified 7 Dicer-like and 16 Argonaute narrow-leafed lupin genes, which were highly homologous to their legume counterparts. We identified 43 conserved miRNAs belonging to 16 families, and 13 novel narrow-leafed lupin-specific miRNAs using high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs from foliar and root and five seed development stages. We observed up-regulation of members of the miRNA families miR167, miR399, miR156, miR319 and miR164 in narrow-leafed lupin seeds, and confirmed expression of miR156, miR166, miR164, miR1507 and miR396 using quantitative RT-PCR during five narrow-leafed lupin seed development stages. We identified potential targets for the conserved and novel miRNAs and were able to validate targets of miR399 and miR159 using 5\u2032 RLM-RACE. The conserved miRNAs are predicted to predominately target transcription factors and 93% of the conserved miRNAs originate from intergenic regions. In contrast, only 43% of the novel miRNAs originate from intergenic regions and their predicted targets were more functionally diverse.This study provides important insights into the miRNA gene regulatory networks during narrow-leafed lupin seed development.Grain legume crops, such as chickpea (Cicer arieratum), common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), faba bean (Vicia faba), lentil (Lens culinaris), pea (Pisum sativum) and narrow-leafed lupin (Lupinus angustifolius) are important in crop rotations due to their ability to fix their own nitrogen, therefore reducing the reliance on commercial fertilizers and providing a break in the disease cycles in cereal and oilseed crops [1]. Grain legumes, also known as pulses, are of particular importance in vegetarian diets as an important source of protein and micronutrients while also being low in fats. Narrow-leafed lupin for human consumption, has a number of attractive nutritional attributes relating to their high protein content, high dietary fibre and negligible starch levels [2]. Recent studies have also demonstrated a number of human health benefits associated with consumption of lupin grains, particularly in the areas of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity [3\u20135]. Despite the attractive properties of the lupin grain as a food source, this legume of the Genistoid clade has only recently been domesticated [6], with current elite cultivars having a very narrow-genetic base [7]. Thus there is a considerable potential to improve the quality of the lupin grain and its yield.A number of genetic and genomic resources have recently been developed for narrow-leafed lupin to accelerate crop improvement. These include the generation of various BAC libraries [8, 9], transcriptome datasets [10, 11], a comprehensive reference genome [12], various re-sequenced cultivars [13], large sets of molecular markers and two dense genetic maps [11, 14, 15] as well as BAC-FISH cytogenetic markers assigning each linkage group to a chromosome [16]. The generation of in depth transcriptome datasets for a number of different tissue types [10, 11], combined with a quality reference genome assembly [12], enables the investigation into the small RNA complement of narrow-leafed lupin.Plants contain several classes of endogenous small RNAs, the most abundant being small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) produced from double stranded RNA precursors, which depending upon their biogenesis, can be further classified into heterochromatic siRNAs, secondary siRNAs and natural antisense transcripts siRNAs (nat-siRNAs) [17]. MicroRNAs are another abundant and ubiquitous class of small RNAs, and unlike siRNAs are derived from single stranded RNA transcript precursors that form imperfect hairpin-like structures [17]. In plants, miRNAs are involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of diverse aspects of growth and seed development, as well as stress tolerance [18]. In Arabidopsis, miR156 prevents over-accumulation of SPL10 and SPL11 transcription factors that may otherwise lead to abnormal embryo development [19]. Negative regulation of ARF10 by miR160 plays a critical role in seed germination [20]. Specific loss of miR166 can cause the ectopic expression of seed maturation genes in Arabidopsis [21] and they may play an important role in soybean seed development [22]. miR164 may play a role in normal embryonic development by degrading CUC1 and CUC2 mRNAs [23]. Thus, further focus on seed expression of miRNAs should help understand the roles of miRNAs in seed development.The miRNA genes are initially transcribed by RNA polymerase II as \u201clong\u201d single stranded primary transcripts (pri-miRNA) which form imperfect hairpin stem-loop structures [24, 25]. These hairpin stem-loop structures are processed by DICER like-1 (DCL1) RNase III endonucleases which function in concert with the accessory proteins DOUBLE-STRANDED RNA-BINDING1 (DRB1; also known as HYPONASTIC LEAVES1) and SERRATE (SE), to produce precursor-miRNA (pre-miRNAs) sequences [26\u201328]. The precursor miRNAs undergo additional cleavage by DCL1 to release the ~\u200921\u2009bp miRNA (guide)/miRNA*(passenger) duplex, which is stabilised by 2\u2019-O-methylation by HUA ENHANCER 1 (HEN1) [29]. Following export from the nucleus, the miRNA duplex is bound by ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1), forming the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) which directs cleavage of target mRNA sequences with a high degree of complementarity to the miRNA-guide, via the endonuclease activity of AGO1 [30\u201332]. Some plant miRNAs can also direct translational inhibition of their targets by preventing the recruitment of ribosomes during translation initiation or blocking ribosome movement during translation elongation [33, 34]. MiRNAs can also function as long distant signalling molecules and have been found within the phloem [35, 36].The number of plant miRNAs deposited in public databases such as miRBase has increased rapidly over the last two decades [37]. Over 20 miRNA families are conserved amongst the angiosperms with a large number of these targeting genes encoding transcription factors, which regulate important aspects of plant growth and development [37, 38]. Plants also contain a number of lineage specific miRNAs. New miRNA genes can be formed via a number of mechanisms including the duplication of existing miRNA genes, the inverted duplication of protein coding genes or through transposable elements [39]. Linage specific miRNAs are generally found as single copy genes, have a high birth-death rate, low expression and have few if any targets [40]. As such, most new linage specific miRNAs are often considered to be \u2018transient\u2019 or evolutionary neutral [41].A number of miRNA identification studies have been undertaken in legumes, with the model legume Medicago truncatula and soybean (Glycine max) being the most comprehensively studied. For these two legumes species, miRNAs have been identified in different tissue types, during nodulation and mycorrhization and under various abiotic stress conditions [42, 43]. For instance, miR1507 has been identified only in legume species so far, and may play a key role in nodulation [43]. MiRNA identification studies have also been undertaken in the common bean (P. vulgaris) [44], peanut (Arachis hypogaea) [45] and mung bean (Vigna mungo) [46]. Only two miRNA studies have been undertaken on species within the Lupinus genus, with both of these studies focused on white lupin (Lupinus albus) [47, 48]. In one study, 383 small RNA sequences were isolated and sequenced from the phloem exudate, with 17 of these sequences exhibiting homology to 7 miRNA families previously deposited on miRBase [47]. The other study examined the global expression of miRNAs under phosphate deficiency in white lupin plants using microarray analysis and identified 30 families of miRNAs, with several showing tissue specificity [48].In this report we first examined how well conserved the machinery for generating small RNAs was in narrow-leafed lupin compared to other legumes, given narrow-leafed lupin\u2019s position in legume phylogeny within the Genistoid clade, which is quite distant from other well characterised legumes [12, 14]. For this analysis, we focused on the Dicer-like and Argonaute genes, identifying members of these gene families in the narrow-leafed lupin genome, examining their expression profiles and also their phylogeny relative to other Dicer-like and Argonaute gene members in legumes. We then undertook a comprehensive analysis of the small RNA profile of L. angustifolius cultivar Tanjil, with a focus on seed developmental stages. We describe the identification of conserved and novel miRNAs as well as the in silico identification of their putative targets. We confirmed the small RNAseq expression profiles using Quantitative PCR and validated a subset of putative targets using 5\u2032 RLM-RACE analysis. These findings expand the list of annotated miRNAs for legumes and provides important insights into the miRNA gene regulatory networks during narrow-leafed lupin seed development and will lay the foundations to improve the quality of the lupin grain in the future.L. angustifolius (cultivar Tanjil) seeds were obtained from the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) of Western Australia who maintain the Australian lupin collection. Seeds were germinated and grown in temperature controlled growth cabinets at 22\u2009\u00b0C\u2009day for 16\u2009h and 20\u2009\u00b0C night for 8\u2009h. Once plants started to flower and set seed on the main stem, foliar tissue (stems and leaves) was harvested, as well as five different seed developmental stages: 4\u20138 DAA (days after anthesis), 9\u201320 DAA, 21\u201326 DAA, 27\u201332 DAA, and 39\u201344 DAA for subsequent RNA extraction.The lupin genome assembly (version 1.0; [12]), was interrogated with sequences of Dicer-like (DCL1\u20134) and Argonaute genes (AGO1\u201310) from Arabidopsis thaliana and their predicted homologs in Medicago truncatula, L. japonicus and Glycine max described in [42]. As an additional line of evidence, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis using conserved PFam and InterPro term domains were used to search for DCL and AGO genes encoded in the annotated gene set of the narrow-leafed lupin genome. Phylogenetic trees for the DCL and AGO genes were generated using the ETE 3 software with the standard_raxml workflow [49]. This used Clustal Omega as the aligner [50] and RAxML for phylogenetic tree prediction [51].Total RNA was isolated from the foliar and seed tissue using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as described by [11]. The generation of TruSeq smallRNA libraries (Illumina, San Diego, CA) was performed according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations using the TruSeq small RNA library sample preparation kit with an input amount of 1\u2009\u03bcg total RNA and sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq. The raw data for each of the libraries were deposited in GenBank under BioProject ID: PRJNA299755.Adapters were trimmed using cutadapt (\u2212m18 \u2013M28 -q30 \u2013trim-n \u2013discard-untrimmed) [52]. Untrimmed reads, reads shorter than 18 nts or reads larger than 28 nts were discarded and flanking N bases were removed from each read [52]. Additional filtering was performed by removal of reads that mapped to rRNA, tRNA, and snoRNA using bowtie 1.1.2 [53].For miRNA identification, we used the ShortStack 3.8.5 software [54] on the clean sRNA reads. We further filtered the predicted sRNA clusters to include only those where >\u2009=\u200980% of reads are within 20\u201324 nts of length. This is the recommended procedure in ShortStack to avoid degradation products. We also included only sRNA clusters with at least 2 reads per million (RPM). We used the read counts returned by ShortStack for all predicted sRNA clusters and used edgeR [55] to assess which are differentially expressed at any of the infection stages versus germinated spores (FDR\u2009<\u20090.05, fold change >\u20092).The conserved and novel miRNAs were aligned to the cv. Tanjil reference genome assembly with ShortStack [54] and their scaffold coordinates used to place the miRNAs onto the narrow-leafed lupin pseudochromosomes and visualised using the MapChart v2.2 software [56]. The miRNA star sequences/secondary structures as predicted by ShortStack are provided in Additional\u00a0file\u00a01.MiRNA targets were identified using the psRNATarget software (2011 release) [55] against the narrow-leafed lupin transcriptome datasets [11]. Targets were predicted using the default parameters, except the maximum expectation cut off score was set to 2.5.Prior to RNA isolation, 100\u2009mg of tissue was spiked with 100\u2009nM of a random RNA sequence (UUAAGGCACGCGGUGAAUGCCAGCAGUGGC). The miRNA was isolated by using the PureLink\u00ae miRNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. The small RNA fraction was polyadenylated using poly(A) polymerase (NEB), and reverse transcribed using superscript III (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a poly(T) adaptor primer as described in [57]. qRT-PCR was performed using SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad) in 10\u2009\u03bcL reactions on a CFX384 (Bio-Rad) system. Thermocycling conditions for each miRNA was determined experimentally. In general, thermocycling conditions were as followed: 95\u2009\u00b0C for 2.30\u2009min (1\u2009cycle); 95\u2009\u00b0C for 15\u2009s, 60\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s, 72\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s (40\u2009cycles), followed by a dissociation curve analysis of 65\u201395\u2009\u00b0C at 0.5\u2009\u00b0C per cycle. Quantification was performed using the 2-\u2206CT method, with miRNA expression normalised relative to the random RNA sequence. The primer sequences used for qPCR analysis can be found in Additional file 2: Table S1.A modified RLM- 5\u2019 RACE was performed essentially as described in [58, 59]. Briefly, total RNA was ligated to an RNA adaptor (CGACUGGAGCACGAGGACACUGACAUGGACUGAAGGAGUAGAAA), and reverse transcribed using superscript III (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a gene specific primer. PCR amplification was undertaken using primers designed within the adaptor sequence and gene specific primers located approximately 400-500\u2009bp downstream from the putative cleavage site (Additional file 1: Table S1). A nested PCR reaction was performed and PCR products corresponding to the predicted size sub-cloned into either pGEM Teasy TA vector or TOPO \u2013 TA vector and transformed into E. coli with plasmid from 10 to 15 independent colonies sequenced.As the first step in studying the miRNA composition of narrow-leafed lupin we analysed some of the components of the cellular machinery involved in generating the miRNAs, namely the Argonaute and the Dicer-like gene complement within narrow-leafed lupin. The lupin genome assembly was interrogated with sequences of Dicer-like (DCL1\u20134) and Argonaute genes (AGO1\u201310) from Arabidopsis thaliana and their predicted homologs in M. truncatula, L. japonicus and G. max [42, 60, 61]. As an additional line of evidence, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis using conserved Pfam domains and InterPro terms were used to search for DCL and AGO genes encoded in the annotated gene set of the narrow-leafed lupin genome.Changes in expression profiles following gene duplication events can facilitate functional diversification, therefore we examined the expression profiles of the AGO genes using the transcriptome datasets of five narrow-leafed lupin tissue types (root, stem, leaf, flower and seed) previously described [11]. Each of the AGO genes were expressed within the tissues examined, with a subset of LaAGO genes highly expressed within the seed (Additional file 3: Figure S1A). In particular, three members of the narrow-leafed lupin LaAGO4 family (LaAGO4a, LaAGO4c and LaAGO4d) showed notably higher expression levels in the seed tissue compared to the other tissue types. LaAGO1b also exhibited notably higher expression level in the seed compared to other tissue types. This may be indicative of a specialised function for these AGO4 and AGO1 orthologues in narrow-leafed lupin seed development.We also examined the Dicer-like gene complement within narrow-leafed lupin. Plants contain four Dicer-like (DCL) families (DCL1\u20134) [63]. Here we identified seven DCL genes in the narrow-leafed lupin genome including three gene members for DCL2, two members for DCL3 and a single gene member for DCL1 and DCL4, all of which exhibited close homology to other legume DCL genes (Fig. 1a; Additional file 3: Table S2). We also examined the expression profile of the narrow-leafed lupin DCL genes using the transcriptome datasets described above (Additional file 4: Figure S1B). LaDCL1 and LaDCL4 were highly expressed in all tissue types examined. LaDCL2a, LaDCL2b, LaDCL2c and LaDCL3a were also highly expressed, though differences in expression levels were observed between tissue types. LaDCL2a, LaDCL2c and LaDCL3a show highest expression levels in the seed tissue compared to the other tissue types. We did not detect LaDCL3b expression in any of the five different tissue types examined. Furthermore, LaDCL3b is also lacking the first 217 amino acids when compared with LaDCL3a, and thus may be a pseudogene. In Arabidopsis, DCL3 produces 24\u2009nt siRNAs that function in DNA methylation [64].To compile a comprehensive list of narrow-leafed lupin miRNA sequences, with a focus on seeds, we generated small RNA sequencing libraries for foliar tissue (leaf and stem), root tissue and five different seed developmental stages; 4\u20138\u2009days DAA, 9\u201320 DAA, 21\u201326 DAA, 27\u201332 DAA, and 39\u201344 DAA. We chose these stages as they involve discrete steps of lupin seed development as described in [65]. Briefly, embryogenesis occurs during the early stages of seed development during which the zygote differentiates into the embryo proper. By approximately 9\u201320 DAA the seed has transitioned into the maturation phase, during which cell division has decreased and storage proteins have begun to accumulate [66]. Once the seed has reached its physiological maturity by approximately 39\u201344 DAA, water is rapidly lost and the seed enters into a state of dormancy [65, 66]. In addition to the seed developmental stages we generated small RNA libraries for stem, leaf and root tissue to represent vegetative tissue types, which would allow us to identify seed specific miRNAs.We identified seven highly conserved miRNA plant families (miRNA 156, 159/319, 165/166, 167, 390, 396) being present across Embryophyta. Furthermore, we identified seven miRNA families (miRNAs 162, 164, 168, 393, 398, 399, 403) that are also considered highly conserved among angiosperms. We also found two miRNA families (miRNAs 1511, 1507) that are less conserved and considered core Rosids miRNAs (which include Fabaceae) [41, 70]. Multiple distinct genomic loci were predicted to produce each of the conserved miRNA families. For example, nine genomic loci were predicted to produce miR166, whereas the newly evolved legume specific miRNA families (miR1507, miR1511) were produced by one or two genomic loci. All the novel predicted miRNAs only have one genomic locus as their origin.We also found evidence for a novel miRNA complement within narrow-leafed lupin, namely 13 miRNAs predicted by ShortStack that do not share significant sequence similarity with known miRNA families deposited on miRBase (Table 1). Of the 13 novel miRNAs, we found two to be up-regulated in seed (NovmiR12 and NovmiR13) (Fig. 3). The novel miRNA sequences were predominately 21\u2009nt (61.5%) or 22\u2009nt (23.1%) in length, with a higher proportion of 22\u2009nt sequences comparatively to the conserved miRNAs (21% are 21\u2009nt in length, 9.3% are 22\u2009nt in length). We also observed a 5\u2032 uridine nucleotide bias in 53.9% of the novel miRNA sequences.An additional class of DCL3 dependent 24\u2009nt long miRNAs, which direct DNA methylation at target loci and also at their own loci through association with AGO4, has been described in rice [74, 75]. One of the conserved miRNAs and two of the novel predicted miRNAs were 24\u2009nt in length that could potentially be classified as novel long miRNAs. The mature miRNA sequences all contained a 5\u2032 adenine nucleotide.The majority of the conserved miRNA sequences (93%) were located within the intergenic regions (Additional file 5: Table S3). The remaining 7% of sequences were located within the UTR regions of annotated transcripts, with no sequences located within the intron/exon regions. In contrast, only 46.2% of the novel miRNA sequences were located within intergenic regions, 30.8% were located within introns and the remaining 23.1% located within the UTRs or exons of annotated transcripts (Additional file 5: Table S3). This suggests that lupin harbours both conserved miRNAs that are typically found in intergenic regions in plants as well as evolutionary recent miRNAs that appear to originate from introns, exons or UTRs.Putative miRNA targets were identified using the psRNATarget software and narrow-leafed lupin transcriptome datasets previously generated by our laboratory. Using stringent parameters (expectation cut-off score of 2.5), 49 putative unique targets for the conserved miRNAs were identified (Additional file 6: Table S4). Whilst some bona fide targets may not be identified by using stringent parameters, this was considered to be preferable than the inclusion of large numbers of false positive targets within our datasets. A large proportion of genes encoding for transcription factors (40.4%) were identified as putative miRNA targets. Analysis of the InterPro terms revealed the presence of several different classes of transcription factors within our datasets including; GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR (GRF) transcription factors, SBP-box transcription factors, MYB transcription factors and Zinc finger domain proteins (Additional file 6: Table S4). The remaining targets encoded proteins involved in various other cellular processes.We identified 20 unique genes that were putatively targeted by novel miRNAs (Additional file 7: Table S5). We did not identify targets for five of the novel miRNAs (NovmiR03, NovmiR06, NovmiR07, NovmiR09 and NovmiR12). Only 20% of the identified targets for the novel miRNAs encoded transcription factors (MYB and BIM1 transcription factors and B3 domain-containing proteins). The remaining targets encode proteins with a diverse array of functions. Among these targets we found proteins annotated as a molybdate transporter 1, a calcium-transporting ATPase 8, a TMV resistance protein N, a lysine-specific demethylase JMJ16 and a nudix hydrolase protein (Additional file 7: Table S5). The functional diversity of proteins targeted by linage specific miRNAs has also been reported in other plant species [76, 77].Narrow-leafed lupin, an emerging crop species, has only recently been domesticated and the germplasm still contains several undesirable phenotypic traits within the seed grain [79]. MiRNAs are key regulators of numerous plant developmental processes and as such represent a potential mechanism to manipulate and improve agronomic traits such as yield and nutritional quality of the seed. Here we have sequenced the small RNA population from several different seed stages of narrrow-leafed lupin as well as the foliar tissue with the aim of identifying miRNAs that may contribute to seed development, and thus represent potential targets for miRNA-based plant improvement.Initially we were interested in examining the genetic composition of important components of the small RNA biogenesis machinery within the narrow-leafed lupin genome, particularly as the Genistoid clade is quite phylogenetically distant from other well characterised legumes [12, 14]. We identified seven Dicer-like and 16 Argonaute-like genes in the narrow-leafed lupin genome assembly that shared a high level of homology with their legume orthologs. The number of AGO genes in other legumes is highly variable, with M. truncatula containing 12 AGO genes, G. max (soybean) containing 20 AGO genes while only 9 AGO genes have been identified in the L. japonicus genome [42]. The number of AGO genes in other more distantly related plant species is also highly variable, with A. thaliana containing 10 AGO genes [80] and rice containing 19 AGO genes [81, 82]. Genome duplication events may underlie the rapid expansion of the AGO gene family during plant evolution, facilitating the functional diversification of the AGO proteins, and contributing to the complexity of the small RNA pathways in plants [81, 83]. A recent whole genome triplication event within narrow-leafed lupin [12, 14] and a whole genome duplication event within soybean [84], could potentially explain the increase in AGO gene copies within both these species, comparatively to other legumes. Interestingly, the number of DCL genes were comparable between the legume species examined, with both M. truncatula [60] and L. japonicus [42] containing 6 DCL genes, and G. max containing 7 DCL genes [42, 60], similar to what was found for narrow-leafed lupin. It is possible that functional constraints such as gene dosage effects, may have contributed to gene loss events following the whole genome duplication events in both narrow-leafed lupin and soybean. Whether the AGO and the DCL proteins identified in narrow-leafed lupin and other legume species have diversified and evolved additional novel functional roles to those described in other plant species, remains to be elucidated. Experimental analysis of mutants, generated through mutagenesis screens or via emerging technologies such as CRISPR/CAS9, is required to understand the roles of these proteins in the miRNA and siRNA pathways. Nevertheless, our analyses suggest that the Genistoid legume narrow-leafed lupin possesses the required genes for small RNA biogenesis with the identification of 7 Dicer-like and 16 Argonaute-like genes.To examine the involvement of small RNAs during seed development, we undertook a comprehensive analysis of the narrow-leafed lupin small RNA populations using Illumina Small RNA-Seq technology. At each seed developmental stage examined, the small RNA populations were mainly comprised of 24\u2009nt sequences, with 21\u2009nt sequences also abundant within the datasets. Similar compositions have been reported within a variety of tissues from other legumes such as M. truncatula [85] and chickpea [76], though within the developing soybean seed, each of the 21, 22 and 24\u2009nt small RNA populations were all highly abundant [86]. The enrichment of the 24\u2009nt small RNA population within narrow-leafed lupin seed, is consistent with heterochromatin siRNAs, derived from transposons and repetitive genomic elements, being a major class of small RNAs within plants [17]. Interestingly, the 24\u2009nt small RNA population was less abundant in the foliar tissue and root libraries as well as the late seed stage 39\u201344 DAA library (34.2, 31 and 51.4% of total read counts respectively) compared to libraries generated from the earlier seed stages, where this population represented 64\u201371% of the total read counts. Dynamic changes in the 24\u2009nt small RNA population during seed development has also been reported within B. napus [87]. Concomitant with the enrichment of the 24\u2009nt small RNA population within narrow-leafed lupin, we observed high expression of the AGO4 orthologs within the seed. AGO4 associates with 24\u2009nt small RNAs, mediating DNA methylation via the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway in other plants species [62]. Thus, these observations suggest an important role for AGO4 and associated 24\u2009nt small RNAs in the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway during seed development.To further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying narrow-leafed lupin seed development we identified the miRNA complement expressed within the seed. We identified a total of 43 conserved miRNA sequences, which were classified into 16 known miRNA families. Multiple sequence variants were identified within a number of the highly conserved miRNA families, many of which mapped to multiple genomic loci, which may be reflective of gene expansion events that have occurred throughout lupin evolution consistent with what has been observed in Arabidopsis [77]. Whilst there was some size heterogeneity, the conserved miRNAs were predominately 21\u2009nt in length (76.7%) with lower proportions of 20\u2009nt and 22\u2009nt sequences also present. We only detected one 24\u2009nt variant of the conserved miRNA sequences, which has also been described within other plant species [88]. In some cases, distinct size variants originating from the same precursor were observed. These variants exhibited sequence heterogeneity at the termini regions possibly due to imprecise DCL processing or through post-transcriptional modifications [89], though end-degradation cannot be excluded. Large repertoires of miRNA sequence variants have been reported within other plants species [90], with differences in target selection, stability or AGO loading efficiency potentially altering biological activity [89, 91]. Although the sequence variants identified here were for the most part predicted to have overlapping targets, we did observe differences in the expression profiles for some variants throughout seed development, which may be indicative of differing biological activities. Tissue specific and developmental specific expression of miRNAs has also been reported in other plant species [59, 92].The miRNA-regulatory networks controlling seed developmental processes such as embryonic patterning, organ polarity and apical meristem formation, are evolutionarily conserved across a wide range of species [93]. Accordingly, we detected a number of miRNAs (miR156, miR164, miR166 and miR396) with previously characterised roles in seed development in other species, many of which exert their regulatory effects through the repression of transcription factors. In A. thaliana, miR156 controls the morphogenesis-maturation phase transition during embryogenesis through repression of SBP-Box transcription factors [19]. We also detected expression of the miR164 family during lupin seed development, consistent with the role of miR164 in embryonic pattern formation in A. thaliana via the regulatory control of NAC (No Apical Meristem) domain containing transcription factors [23, 94]. The miR166 family was also detected during narrow-leafed lupin seed development. In A. thaliana, miR166 targets Class III HD-Zip transcription factors regulating several biological processes during embryogenesis, including lateral organ polarity and shoot apical meristem formation [95\u201397]. As each of these miRNAs were abundant throughout lupin seed development, and were predicted to target similar genes as those described in other plant species, they are likely to represent key regulators of narrow-leafed lupin seed development.Newly evolved miRNAs, once integrated into regulatory networks, can contribute to morphological and physiological diversity within the plant, and thus represent avenues for agronomic trait improvement. As such, we were interested in examining the novel narrow-leafed lupin\u2013specific miRNA complement throughout narrow-leafed lupin seed development. We identified a total of 13 narrow-leafed lupin specific novel miRNAs in our datasets that were between 21 and 24\u2009nt in length. Novel miRNAs were represented by a single sequence variant and transcribed from a single genomic location, consistent with observations in other plant species [40, 41]. According to the current model of plant miRNA evolution, newly emerged miRNA have a high turnover rate, with many miRNA being lost soon after their formation [41]. These \u2018young\u2019 species-specific miRNA genes are often expressed at low levels compared to the highly conserved miRNAs and their regulatory effect and range of targets is expected to be lower. Further investigation of these \u2018young\u2019 narrow-leafed lupin-specific miRNA may be warranted, as one or more may play a role in narrow-leafed lupin development.We also identified three seemingly bona fide 24\u2009nt long miRNAs with narrow-leafed lupin. In A. thaliana, conserved miRNAs are primarily processed by DCL1 to produce 21\u201322\u2009nt mature miRNAs, with a small number of DCL1 dependent 24\u2009nt miRNAs also described [41]. Here size variations in the mature miRNA sequences have been attributed to characteristics of the fold-back precursor structure, specifically the presence of asymmetric bulged nucleotides within the miRNA duplex [98, 99]. An additional class of long 24\u2009nt miRNAs, processed instead by DCL3, and which mediate DNA methylation at target loci through association with AGO4 clade proteins, has also been described in rice and A. thaliana [74, 75]. Here the differences in DCL usage are hypothesised to relate to the fold-back structure of the miRNA precursor [88]. Analysis of the small RNA populations within DCL1, DCL3 and RDR2 lupin mutants, will provide additional insight into the biogenesis and the function of the putative 24\u2009nt long miRNAs during narrow-leafed lupin seed development.Here we identified AGO and DCL genes important for the biogenesis of miRNAs in narrow-leafed lupin and highly abundant miRNAs in different developmental stages of the narrow-leafed lupin seed. These miRNAs predominantly targeted transcription factors, some of which have known roles in gene regulation during seed development in other crops. The data presented here on conserved and narrow-leafed lupin specific novel miRNAs during seed development and maturation, adds to the toolbox of genetic and genomic resources for narrow-leafed lupin, offering opportunities to improve the quality of lupin grain, which is increasingly being used for human consumption and as an attractive non-GMO, gluten free, high protein alternative to soybean.days after anthesismicro RNAs narrow-leafed lupin, narrow-leafed lupinsmall interfering RNAsSu Melser was the recipient of a CSIRO OCE Post-doctoral fellowship.

Plant AGO proteins can be classified into three distinct clades; clade I (AGO1/AGO5/AGO10); clade II (AGO2/AGO3/AGO7); and clade III (AGO4/AGO6/AGO8/AGO9). An additional subclade is present within the grasses which contains the AGO18 proteins [61]. Phylogenetic analysis revealed strong homology of the narrow-leafed lupin AGO genes to those of other legumes (G. max, M. truncatula and L. japonicas) (Fig. 1a). We identified three AGO1-like and AGO10-like genes, two AGO5-like and AGO2-like genes and single members for AGO6 and AGO7. Finally four AGO4-like members were identified in the narrow-leafed lupin genome. AGO4 associates with 24\u2009nt small RNAs, mediating DNA methylation via the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway in other plants species [62].\n\nFig. 1\nPhylogenetic analysis of narrow-leafed lupin orthologs of AGO and DCL. a AGO-like gene phylogeny (b) DCL-like gene phylogeny. Trees were predicted using the ETE 3 software [49]\nLibraries were generated and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. Reads were adapter-trimmed and those that mapped to rRNA, tRNA or snoRNA were removed. Following filtering, a total of 5,063,406 reads ranging in size from 18 to 28\u2009nt remained. The small RNA reads show peaks at 21\u2009nt and 24\u2009nt, characteristic for plant small RNAs (Fig.\u00a02). Interestingly, we observed a strong presence of 22\u2009nt small RNAs in the leaf sample. In plants, phased small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs) are produced in a one-hit or two-hit model, where mRNA targets are cleaved by a 22\u2009nt miRNA. In legumes, phasiRNAs are often produced from coding disease resistance genes and appear to be beneficial for plant-microbial interactions and plant immunity [67].\n\nFig. 2\nRead length distributions in the leaf, stem, root and seed samples. Peaks occur at 21\u2009nt and 24\u2009nt in all samples, as well as at 22\u2009nt in the leaf sample\nIdentification of miRNA and small RNA sequences was undertaken using the ShortStack software [54]. Briefly, ShortStack performs alignment of small RNA-seq data as well as annotation and quantification of small RNA-producing genes. ShortStack predicts miRNAs using a range of stringent criteria, in line with [68]. Using ShortStack, we identified a total of 56 miRNAs within the lupin small RNA datasets, of which 43 were classified into 16 known miRNA families. 13 miRNAs did not have a hit to a known miRNA and were thus classified as novel miRNAs (Table\u00a01). The predicted miRNAs were predominately 21\u2009nt in length (73.2%), with lower proportions of 20\u2009nt (8.9%) and 22\u2009nt (12.5%) miRNAs present within the datasets. Furthermore, 75% of the predicted miRNA sequences contained a 5\u2032 uridine nucleotide bias in accordance with observations in A. thaliana where miRNAs that associate with AGO1 predominately have a 5\u2032 uridine nucleotide [69].Table 1\nPredicted miRNAs in lupin using ShortStack [54]\n\nFourty three lupin miRNAs belong to a total of 16 known miRNA families and 13 novel lupin miRNAs were predicted. The genomic locations of the predicted miRNA loci are given as well as the mature miRNA sequence\nmiRNAs have a pivotal role during seed development as part of an intricate regulatory network controlling complex spatio-temporal transcriptional expression patterns that enable stage-specific developmental processes to occur [71, 72]. As such, we examined the expression profiles from the small RNA sequencing of the predicted miRNAs across five seed development stages, which encompassed embryogenesis, maturation and the onset of seed dormancy (Fig.\u00a03). We detected highest relative expression of members of the miR167, miR390, miR164, miR399, miR156/157, miR1511 and mir319 families in seed (Fig. 3), as well as of seven novel predicted miRNAs (NovmiR13, NovmiR12, NovmiR04, NovmiR02, NovmiR08, NovmiR06, NovmiR11). We then performed a differential expression analysis comparing the combined seed stages versus the combined vegetative stages (leaf, stem, root) and found that Lan-miR-156a-2, Lan-miR-164-3, Lan-miR-167a/c, Lan-miR-319, Lan-miR-399b/c, NovmiR12 and NovmiR13 are up-regulated in seeds.\n\nFig. 3\nA heatmap showing the relative expression of predicted miRNAs in reads per million (RPM). Seed expression is shown as the average RPM of the five seed stages. Hierarchical clustering shows the main patterns of expression. Differential expression analysis using edgeR on the three vegetative samples (leaf, stem, root) versus the five seed stages was used to assess up- or down-regulation in seeds\nPotential roles in seed development, dormancy, and germination have been suggested for miR156, miR160, miR169, and miR396 [73]. We confirmed the expression of miR156, miR396 as well as miR166, miR164 and miR1507 using quantitative RT-PCR during narrow-leafed lupin seed development (Fig.\u00a04). This confirmed their expression during seed development and revealed distinct expression profiles during the different stages of seed development. For example, whilst miR166, miR164, miR1507 and miR396 are expressed highly during the early seed stages, miR156 is expressed highly in mature seeds.\n\nFig. 4\nqPCR analysis of miR156/157, miR166, miR164, and miR396 expression levels in five seed developmental stages (4\u20138 DAA, 9\u201320 DAA, 21\u201326 DAA, 27\u201332 DAA, and 39\u201344 DAA). Expression was normalised to a random small RNA spiked into the samples prior to RNA extraction. Data is drawn as scatter plot with a line indicating the mean of the three replicates\nMiRNA loci are usually located in intergenic regions within the genomes of plants [39]. To determine whether a similar distribution is observed within narrow-leafed lupin, we analysed the genomic location of both the conserved and novel miRNA candidates. The genomic coordinates (e.g. scaffold coordinates) of the miRNAs were used to assign the miRNAs to a chromosome to determine the distribution of the miRNAs across the 20 chromosomes of narrow-leafed lupin (Fig.\u00a05). The miRNA sequences were dispersed through the lupin genome, although no miRNAs were identified on chromosomes NLL-03, NLL-10, NLL-13, NLL-18 and NLL-19. Four of the 56 miRNA identified were not on scaffolds in the pseudochromosome assembly including one novel miRNA (NovmiR03). NLL-01 harbours the largest number of miRNAs, nine including one novel miRNA (NovmiR08). Novel miRNAs were distributed across nine different chromosomes with NLL-20 harbouring three novel miRNAs (NovmiR04, NovmiR09 and NovmiR10). Members of conserved miRNAs were distributed across the chromosomes rather than clustered together, which is consistent with observations in other plant species [40]. However, three of the five Lan-miR-396 family members reside on NLL-01, whereas one resides on NLL-12, with the other on a scaffold yet to be assigned to a pseudochromosome.\n\nFig. 5\nDistribution of miRNAs across the 20 narrow-leafed lupin chromosomes. The position of each miRNA has been shown relative to the pseudochromosome coordinates of the narrow-leafed lupin assembly [12] with the novel miRNAs distinguished in bold from the conserved miRNAs. The value on the left of the pseudochromosome represent the physical location in Mb of a given miRNA presented on the right of each pseudochromosome\nmiRNA-mediated target cleavage occurs precisely between the 10th and 11th nucleotide upstream of the 5\u2032 end of the miRNA sequence, and as such the cleavage sites can be validated using 5\u2032 RLM-RACE [58, 59]. Using this approach, we attempted to validate the targets for two conserved miRNAs (Lan-miR-399, Lan-miR-159) and were successful in each case. Thus, we validated miR399 mediated cleavage of Lup029358.1, a putative Ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme, involved in maintenance of phosphate homeostasis in other plant species [78] (Fig.\u00a06). We also validated the cleavage of Lup032338.1, a putative MYB transcription factor targeted by miR159 (Fig. 6).\n\nFig. 6\nMapping of the cleavage sites for two conserved miRNAs targets using modified 5\u2032 RLM- RACE.

High-throughput omics data in the form of molecular profile matrices, such as transcriptomes and metabolomes, have long existed as a valuable resource for facilitating diagnosis of patient statuses/stages. It is timely imperative to compare deep learning neural networks against classical machine learning methods in the setting of matrix-formed omics data in terms of classification accuracy and robustness.Using 37 high throughput omics datasets, covering transcriptomes and metabolomes, we evaluated the classification power of deep learning compared to traditional machine learning methods. Representative deep learning methods, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), were deployed and explored in seeking optimal architectures for the best classification performance. Together with five classical supervised classification methods (Linear Discriminant Analysis, Multinomial Logistic Regression, Na\u00efve Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine), MLP and CNN were comparatively tested on the 37 datasets to predict disease stages or to discriminate diseased samples from normal samples. MLPs achieved the highest overall accuracy among all methods tested. More thorough analyses revealed that single hidden layer MLPs with ample hidden units outperformed deeper MLPs. Furthermore, MLP was one of the most robust methods against imbalanced class composition and inaccurate class labels.Our results concluded that shallow MLPs (of one or two hidden layers) with ample hidden neurons are sufficient to achieve superior and robust classification performance in exploiting numerical matrix-formed omics data for diagnosis purpose. Specific observations regarding optimal network width, class imbalance tolerance, and inaccurate labeling tolerance will inform future improvement of neural network applications on functional genomics data.In the past decade, deep neural networks have inspired waves of novel applications for machine learning problems. Recently, the biomedical field has also witnessed a surge of deep learning assisted studies, which involve protein structure prediction, gene expression regulation, protein classification, etc. [1]. For instance, in just 3 years, a series of deep learning models [2\u20135] was devised to map DNA/RNA sequence motifs and boost transcription factor binding estimation. In addition, deep learning models have been built for classifying metagenomics [6] and predicting heart failure [7], suicide risk [8], hospital re-admission [9], and disease outcomes [10].Many deep learning applications use feedforward artificial neural network models [11]. Perceptrons [12] are the simplest form of feedforward neural networks which consist of only two layers (input and output). Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) extend from perceptrons by embedding one or more hidden layers. MLP and alike models had a long and continual record of successes in the supervised classification of high-throughput molecular data. One of the best well-known examples is the classification of four subtypes of small-round-blue-cell tumors, executed on 63 training subjects and 25 testing subjects in 2001 [13]. This pioneering study applied a Linear Perceptron, a two-layered neural network with a linear activation function. Following this seminal study, artificial neural network models gained great popularity in the supervised classification of microarray expression data [14\u201316]. Very recently, a two-layered artificial neural network was adapted to achieve excellent prognosis prediction of the new generation of gene expression profiles, RNA-Seq data [17].Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a recent divergent variant of MLP, comprising one or more convolutional layers followed by one or more fully connected layers. With demonstrated advantage in processing images and videos, CNN becomes a trendy jackknife for various machine learning applications, and the biomedical domain is no exception. A notable application of CNN in biological studies is DeepBind, which predicts the sequence specificities for hundreds of DNA- and RNA-binding proteins [2]. Most recently, CNN was applied to mine medical records for predicting hospital re-admission [9]. More adapted CNN models for biomedical research are on the horizon [18, 19].Decades ago, it was proposed that one hidden layer with an appropriate number of neurons (units) suffices the \u201cuniversal approximation\u201d property [20, 21]. It is generally agreed that a neural network with more than one hidden layer can be regarded as a deep architecture, so CNNs and MLPs of two or more hidden layers are classified as deep learning model. With neural network models re-gaining popularity in the deep learning wave, it is worthwhile to interrogate the additional merit brought forth by the \u201cdeeper\u201d architecture particularly. As a matter of fact, doubtful voices arose. For example, despite its name, DeepBind may not necessarily be \u201cdeep,\u201d because many of its models are composed of merely one convolution step along with its associated operations. A subsequent survey of DeepBind and related CNN architectures concluded that deep architectures are not necessary for the motif discovery task [22]. In another evaluative work, it was suggested that the deep learning approaches may not be suitable for metagenomic classification [23].Nevertheless, deep architectures are rapidly emerging for tackling the disease diagnosis problem. One study [24] leveraged an unsupervised deep learning method, the sparse autoencoder, to transform feature representation before a traditional supervised model (Logistic Regression) was employed for disease classification. Only minor improvement was brought forth by the sparse autoencoder [24]. Another study [25] applied a CNN-rooted Generative Adversarial Network to discriminate cancer samples from normal samples using microarray data. This study was implemented on only two datasets, and the results were compared between the Generative Adversarial Network and two baselines based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines. Without comparing to a wide panel of alternative models and without testing on a good number of datasets, the alleged advantage of the proposed deep learning model was not convincing. These recent trials did not successfully prove deep neural networks as a superior choice in exploiting omics data for diagnosis purpose. It is under-addressed whether deep neural network architectures is as promising for this purpose as in other successful applications [1]. Explicit and unambiguous guidance is expected to inform the data scientists and computational researchers in the community at large.Given the uncertain performance in omics-based anomaly classification yet demonstrated successes in other biomedical research sectors, deep neural network models deserve a thorough evaluation in the setting of well-structured genomics datasets, being benchmarked against their shallow analogs as well as classical models beyond neural networks. Herein, we evaluated the performance of MLP and CNN relative to classical machine learning models for disease classification on omics data (including high throughput transcriptome and metabolome datasets). Observations and conclusions made in this study are informative for researchers who are interested in applying deep learning techniques to predict anomaly status from omics data.The pattern of CNN performance is not as evident as that of MLP (Fig. 2, right panes). A weak trend can be observed that one single convolutional layer, especially one with a good number of kernels, tends to outperform other architectures. However this trend is violated by the fact that a three-layered structure (3L1_64U) defeated all other architectures in terms of Kappa (Fig. 2, top-right pane). CNN architecture 3L1_64U achieved the best performance in 22 out of the total 37 datasets, including 13 TCGA cancer-vs-normal discriminations, five TCGA stage classifications, two NSCLC classifications, and CKD stage classification using both positive and negative ion metabolomics datasets. In terms of ACC, single-layered CNNs of moderate or large numbers of kernels (128 and 64) outperformed the three-layered CNN model (Fig. 2, bottom-right pane).A similar composite heatmap figure involving six additional architectures that waived the drop-out design is provided in Additional file 1: Figure S1. Across the expanded architecture set, the phenomenon was still obvious that single-layered MLPs with ample hidden units achieved the best performance, whereas the CNN performance pattern becomes even more obscure. As a side note, we found that MLP models with the drop-out design consistently outperformed MLP models devoid of the drop-out design. This distinction was not apparent with CNN models.For each distinct classification scenario, we determined an optimal architecture for MLP/CNN as the one winning the most datasets and evaluated the performance of MLP and CNN using these optimal architectures. MLP\u2019s optimal architectures were 1L_64U for the scenarios of TCGA (stage classification) and NSCLC (adenocarcinoma vs squamous); 1L_128U for the scenarios of TCGA (cancer vs normal), NSCLC (stage classification), and CKD (stage classification). Of note, 1\u2009L-128\u2009U was not found as the optimal architecture for MLP across all scenarios. 1\u2009L-64\u2009U was found to be nearly as good as 1\u2009L-128\u2009U in the overall evaluation, being voted in the 2nd place by Kappa and in the 1st place by ACC (Fig. 2, left panes). CNN\u2019s best performing architectures were 3L1_64U for all scenarios except for NSCLC (stage classification), which favored 1L_128U.In addition to demonstrating an overall superiority across all 37 datasets, MLP also achieved statistically significant advantage over most competitors in individual groups of datasets for TCGA (cancer vs normal) and the TCGA (stage classification). For the TCGA (cancer vs normal), MLP outperformed all other models except RF in terms of both Kappa and ACC (p\u2009<\u20090.01, Wilcoxon\u2019s Signed Rank Test). For the TCGA (stage classification), MLP outperforms all other models except LDA in either Kappa or ACC (p\u2009<\u20090.01, single-tailed Wilcoxon\u2019s Signed Rank Test). Kappa and ACC for each method and each cancer type unambiguously found MLP as the overall best model for TCGA (cancer vs normal) (Additional file 1: Figure S2). MLP did produce better performance over the majority of the other machine learning methods for the other three test scenarios (NSCLC (adenocarcinoma vs squamous), NSCLC (stage classification), and CKD (stage classification). However, these advantages were not statistically significant. This could be due to limited sample sizes. For example, MLP had higher ACC and Kappa than NB, MLR, LDA, MLP, and SVM in the CKD positive and negative ion metabolomics datasets (Fig. 4b, blue lines), but the advantages cannot be evaluated statistically given that only two datasets were used.All classical methods (MLR, LDA, NB, RF, and SVM) maintain excellent Kappa compared to CNN. One-layered MLP had as good Kappa values as the classical methods in a majority of the whole imbalance range, with deterioration to unacceptable levels at the high imbalance end (tumor vs normal ratio\u2009\u2265\u20098). Two-layered MLP, or 2L_128U specifically, had Kappa values >\u20090.8 until the imbalance ratio elevated to 9, from which the Kappa plunged to negative at the imbalance ratio of 10. Overall, MLP had good robustness against moderate class imbalance, and two-layered MLP showed better robustness than single-layered MLP in this regard.With no mislabeling, RF and MLP-2\u2009L tied as the best performing methods, with exactly the same Kappa of 0.991 and the same ACC of 0.995. As the mislabeling rate increased, RF maintained its high performance. MLP was the second best robustness method. MLP-1\u2009L and MLP-2\u2009L performed neck to neck with slight advantage to MLP-1. LDA followed MLP as the third most robust method.We tested four discrete values for the number of units (neurons) per layer, namely 16, 32, 64, and 128. A positive dependence of classification accuracy on the unit number was observed for MLP. Occasionally, the performance peaked at unit number 64 and plateaued from 64 to 128. In conclusion, when provided with a good number of neurons on the hidden layers, shallow MLPs are sufficient for achieving excellent disease classification accuracy. This conclusion is in agreement with the major finding from a survey of CNN structures for transcription factor binding prediction [22]. While that survey concerned the validity of deep learning models in analyzing DNA sequences, the present study concerns the validity of deep learning models in analyzing numerical matrix-formed data.CNN is likely to succeed when an intrinsic spatial structure exists within the input data, such as in two-dimensional image processing or one-dimensional DNA/RNA sequence analyses. In our scenario, the features of the omics data matrices do not have an innate spatial structure. We mandated an arbitrary structure among features by convolving the features according to the decreasing order of principal components. Lack of genuine spatial structure within the omics data matrices may primarily account for the failure of CNN. The exploration of CNN in such applications may be expanded to settings that incorporate more reasonable feature structures. For example, genes can be grouped to functional terms through Gene Ontology, or they can be organized into clusters according to expression similarity. Indeed, custom CNN models with these very innovative features have appeared in preprint manuscripts [18, 19]. Despite the possibility of improvement, our present work surveyed a representative range for major architecture parameters, namely network depth and width, and we did not detect any promising signal from our numerous trials. Our results tend to resonate with a negative perspective into CNN application in well structured genomics data [23]. At least, our results indicate that a CNN with fine-tuned depth or width is still unlikely to overshadow conventional competitors. Substantial innovation and meticulous benchmarking is needed before CNN can establish a promising role in omics data analysis, especially when dealing with transcriptome data.In conclusion, we found that single-layered MLPs (i.e., MLPs of one hidden layer), and occasionally two-layered MLPs, achieved the best classification performance as long as they were deployed with ample neurons on the hidden layers. The performance of CNN classifiers was inferior compared to MLP, and no evident pattern can be discerned for CNN. Furthermore, when compared with classical machine learning method such as RF and SMV, well-configured MLPs demonstrated an overall best performance. In the face of suboptimal class composition and mislabeled training data, single-layered or two-layered MLPs retained satisfactory robustness. In summary, our results proved that single-layered or two-layered MLP models are a good choice for performing phenotype classification on matrix-formed omics data. The results also dispelled the anticipation of excellent performance of CNN in such scenarios. Although slower compared to classical machine learning methods, the extra computation time used by MLP is still tolerable. The only scenario in which we do not recommend using MLP is for extremely imbalanced classification datasets.In this study, we obtained 37 high-throughput omics datasets from three sources, and organized them into five groups (Table 2). First, RNA-seq data in RSEM format were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) via the R package TCGA2STAT [27] and were log transformed. Cancer stages with number of subjects less than 50 were discarded, and cancer types with two or more eligible stages were retained. As a result, 12 TCGA cancer types (COAD, KIRP, COADREAD, KIPAN, KIRC, THCA, BLCA, BRCA, HNSC, LIHC, LUAD, and LUSC) were used for supervised classification of cancer stages. Cancers COAD and KIRP were divided into two stages; cancers COADREAD, KIPAN, KIRC, and THCA were divided into four stages; all other six cancers, namely BLCA, BRCA, HNSC, LIHC, LUAD, and LUSC, were divided into three stages. From a different perspective, we derived binary-class datasets from 14 TCGA cancers (BRCA, COAD, COADREAD, HNSC, KICH, KIPAN, KIRC, KIRP, LIHC, LUAD, LUSC, PRAD, THCA, and UCEC), focusing on the tumor vs. normal distinction. Since normal samples always account for a minor portion in the TCGA data cohort, we randomly sampled an equal number of tumor samples to match with the normal samples of each cancer type. The random subsampling process was repeated five times, and model training and testing were separately performed on each dataset and averaged across the five trials to return a summary evaluation per cancer type.Second, we downloaded five RNA-seq datasets for multiple stages of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients from Gene Expression Omnibus. These five datasets were accessed via IDs GSE10245, GSE11969, GSE19804, GSE41271, and GSE42127, which involved 58, 144, 59, 265, and 174 human subjects, respectively. All subjects from these five datasets were NSCLC stage I, II, or III patients. Except for GSE19804, all other four datasets were reorganized for binary histology classification between adenocarcinoma and squamous NSCLC.The last two dataset used were high throughput metabolomics datasets generated from 703 subjects in a chronical kidney disease (CKD) study. The 703 subjects include 587 CKD patients with five stages (CKD1\u2009=\u2009120, CKD2\u2009=\u2009104, CKD3\u2009=\u2009110, CKD4\u2009=\u2009119, CKD5\u2009=\u2009134) and 116 age-matched normal healthy controls. The metabolomics dataset were generated by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-high-definition mass spectrometry in both positive and negative ion modes, respectively. The metabolomics data were properly normalized following established guideline [28].In summary, 37 datasets were collected for this study. Each dataset comprised tens of thousands of molecules, so a beforehand feature reduction was unavoidable. To be consistent with a companion ongoing project, we used LASSO [29] to handle the two CKD datasets, and as a result, retained 54 and 49 variables for the CKD-positive and CKD-negative datasets, respectively. Because LASSO did not work on some of the other datasets (i.e., LASSO did not reduce the number of features), we applied the commonly used Principal Component Analysis to select a comparable number of features, namely, 40. Although nowadays computation resource is not as a limiting factor as in the past, our study involved repeated model training/testing on a large number of datasets each involving tens of thousands of raw features (Table 2), which would pose extreme computation burden if\u00a0without any feature reduction. LASSO and Principal Component Analysis effectively reduced the number of features of these datasets to a manageable scale suitable for our comparative evaluation purpose. Feature reduction operation was practiced in another deep learning study [24] as well.We examined two major variants of modern neural networks, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), for our survey. MLPs encompass two-layered feed-forward neural networks which had proven validity in the supervised classification of microarray data. We formalized various architectures of MLPs, making sure to cover deeper models with more than one hidden layer. Recently, CNNs have been successfully employed in sequence analyses of DNA/RNA data [2], and efforts to exploit CNN in numerical omics are on the rise [18, 19]. It\u2019s worthwhile to to investigate if CNN proves as promising in numerical classification as in image recognition at the onset of the trend.The activation functions for all layers except the output layer were always Rectified Linear Units [30], while the output layer used the softmax activation function [31]. The \u201crmsprop\u201d optimizer [32] and the \u201ccategorical_crossentropy\u201d loss function [33] were chosen for all MLP and CNN models. Within each fold of the outer 5-fold cross validation, an inner 5-fold partition of the training dataset was imposed and the inner loop of 5-fold cross validations was utilized to choose the optimal batch size of training examples, from three candidate values (1, 32, and the number of all training examples). For the inner cross-validation implementations, MLP and CNN were configured to learn 1000 epochs of the training datasets, however after completing the inner cross validations the minimal epochs achieving the best validation accuracy were recorded for each value of the batch_size parameter. For the outer cross-validation implementations, the batch size was set as the dataset-specific optimal value and of the optimal epochs (<\u20091000) determined from the inner cross validations was exerted for saving unnecessary computation time. In most cases, we found the optimized batch size was one.We largely followed a previous study by Zeng et al. [22] to devise basic architectures of MLP and CNN models (Fig. 1), from which variant forms with more units per layer and/or more layers were derived (Additional file 1: Table S1). Of note, for narrative ease, we encode the various architectures according to the number of hidden layers, without counting the output layer. For instance, our basic single-layered architecture 1L_16U (Fig. 1) would be called a two-layered network in common terminology. We tested different network widths by setting the number of units at 16, 32, 64, or 124 (Additional file 1: Table S1). These values accorded with the parameter setting in Zeng et al.\u2019s work [22] yet bearing an additional interpolated value (32) to ensure a more even coverage of the tested range. We also investigated the effect of dropping-out [34], a novel technique proposed to mitigate overfitting. By incorporating or removing a final dropout layer which randomly drops out a half of input units) 6\u2009\u00d7\u20092 architectures for both MLP and CNN were formed (Additional file 1: Table S1), upon which we explored possible width-dependent and/or depth-dependent performance patterns. Afterwards, we extended our survey to additional deep MLP architectures containing 2, 3, or 4 hidden layers (Additional file 1: Table S1), arriving at a more definite conclusion on optimal architecture(s) of MLP and CNN for supervised classification using matrix-formed omics data. All deep learning functionalities were offered by the R package keras [35].We examined five classical machine learning models to compare with MLP and CNN. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) realizes classification by seeking a linear combination of features that best separate the labeled objects. The R package MASS [36] was utilized for LDA computation. Multinomial logistic regression (MLR) is an extension of binomial logistic regression to allow for a dependent variable with more than two categories. In essence, MLR models the logit transformation of probability-wise class membership through a linear summation of various dependent variables. The R package nnet [36] was utilized for MLR computation. Na\u00efve Bayes (NB) is a probabilistic classifier that applies Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features. Although the assumption of NB usually does not hold in practical applications, NB often yields acceptable classification performance and may outperform sophisticated algorithms. The R package klaR [37] was utilized for NB computation, where any feature with zero variance in a class was dropped beforehand.Random Forest (RF) is an ensemble model performed by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes. Since its introduction in the 1990s [38], RF has been widely applied in biomedical applications with great successes. The R package randomForest [39] was utilized for RF computation, where the number of trees was set at the suggested value 500.A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. SVM was invented in the 1960s and significantly enhanced in the 1990s [40]. The R package e1071 [41] was utilized for SVM computation, where a linear kernel was adopted.We used two metrics to measure the performance of each method. All aforementioned models provide classification output for each test example as a score vector, which are the probabilities of assigning the examples to each class. Such a score vector is transformed to a class designation by selecting the class with the highest score. Classification Accuracy (ACC) is defined as the proportion of samples that are correctly classified to their class labels. Cohen\u2019s Kappa statistic [42] is an effective but under-utilized metric that has a special advantage for machine learning cases involving multiple classes and/or imbalanced class distribution. More details regarding Kappa statistics are presented in the Additional file 1: Table S2. Most analyses conducted in this study used five-fold cross validation, with four-fold cross validation applied to only GSE10245 and GSE19804, the datasets with limited number of samples (<\u200960).AccuracyBladder urothelial carcinomaBreast invasive carcinomaChronic kidney diseaseConvolutional Neural NetworkColon adenocarcinomaColorectal adenocarcinomaHead and Neck squamous cell carcinomaKidney ChromophobePan-kidney cohort (KICH+KIRC+KIRP)Kidney renal clear cell carcinomaKidney renal papillary cell carcinomaLinear Discriminant AnalysisLiver hepatocellular carcinomaLung adenocarcinomaLung squamous cell carcinomaMulti-Layer PerceptronMultinomial Logistic RegressionNa\u00efve BayesNon-small cell lung cancerProstate adenocarcinomaRandom ForestSupport Vector MachineThe Cancer Genome AtlasThyroid carcinomaUterine Corpus Endometrial CarcinomaCancer Center Supporting Grant from National Cancer Institute (P30CA118100).All data analyzed during this study, except for CKD data, were obtained from public sources and processed through standardized steps as explained in details.

In total, 37 dataset-specific performance values, in ACC or Kappa, are generated for each architecture. Within each dataset, we converted the original performance values for six models to ranks, and evaluated the overall performance of each architecture by the average rank across 37 datasets. The architecture with minimal average rank was regarded as the overall best structure.\n\nFig. 1\nThe basic architectures for MLP (A) and CNN (B). Because MLP\u2019s and CNN\u2019s basic architectures both had a single hidden/convolution layer of 16\u2009units or kernels, they were both coded as \u201c1L_16U.\u201d Starting from 1L_16U, variant architectures with increasing number of units on hidden layers and/or additional hidden layers were included into the testing panel (Additional file 1: Table S1). While not shown in the plot, the architectures by default have a dropout layer immediately prior to the output layer with a dropout rate of 0.5\nThe classification performance of six MLP architectures across 37 tasks are visualized in column-scaled heatmaps (Fig.\u00a02, left panes). The Kappa metric clearly indicates that 1L_128U, the single-layered architecture with 128 hidden units, had the best performance. It appears that the performance of single-layered MLPs had a positive dependence on the number of hidden units, as 1L_128U, 1L_64U, 1L_32U, and 1L_16U were ranked as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th places in overall Kappa performance (Fig. 2, top-left pane). Precisely, 1L_128U attains the highest Kappa for 16 out of 37 datasets, whereas the other three single-layered MLPs won in fewer datasets (13 times for 1L_64U, 7 times for 1L_32U, and 5 times for 1L_16U). A two-layered MLP with 16/32\u2009units (2L1_32U) and a three-layered MLP with 16/32/64\u2009units (3L1_64U) returned inferior performance than the four single-layered MLPs. The ACC metric gave similar rankings of the six MLP architectures (Fig. 2, bottom-left), although placing the model of 64\u2009units (1L_64U, average rank\u2009=\u20092.71) ahead of the model of 128\u2009units (1L_128U, average rank\u2009=\u20092.78). In terms of ACC, 1L_128U performed best 13 times, and 1L_64U performed best 12 times.\n\nFig. 2\nPerformance of six architectures of MLP/CNN in classifying 37 datasets. Values in each column\u00a0were scaled.\u00a0Architectures were ordered by the mean rank of performance across all 37 datasets (\u201cAggregate\u201d bar). TCGA transcriptome data were employed for both stage classification (12 cases) and cancer/normal classification (*, 14 cases). Five original NSCLC datasets were organized into nine datasets for stage classification (5 datasets) and histology classification (4 datasets), separately. Two metabolome datasets for chronic kidney disease were adopted to perform classification among 6 classes\nThese results suggest that single-layered MLPs with a moderate-to-great (\u2265 64) number of units outperform MLPs of multiple hidden layers. Nevertheless, the six primary architectures covered only one instance of two-layered and one instance of three-layered structures. To fully verify the presumable advantage of single-layered MLPs, we additionally investigated two-layered MLP architectures with alternative unit configurations (2L1_64U and 2L1_128U) and deeper MLPs with equal numbers of units per layer (2L_128U, 3L_128U, and 4L_128U) were tuned to the supposedly optimal value (128). Still, single-layered MLPs 1L_128U and 1L_64U dominated over other architectures, with 1L_128U ranked the best for both Kappa and ACC and 1L_64U ranked the 3rd place for Kappa and the 2nd place for ACC (Fig.\u00a03).\n\nFig. 3\nRanks of classification performance of six primary and five extended architectures of MLP. The original performance measures (Kappa or ACC) were converted to ranks (1\u201311) within each dataset, with a smaller rank signifying a better performance. Each dot represented a rank per architecture and per dataset. Dots were colored by the dataset group (see section Datasets). Architectures were ordered by the mean rank across all datasets. See Additional file 1: Table S1 for definitions of the various architectures\nAcross all datasets, the average Kappa performance of the seven machine learning models were sorted from best to worst in the following order: MLP, LDA, MLR, NB, CNN, RF, and SVM (Fig.\u00a04a, left). Across all datasets, the average ACC performance of the seven models were sorted from best to worst in the following order: MLP, RF, LDA, NB, SVM, MLR, CNN (Fig. 4a, right). Per either Kappa or ACC, MLP stood out as the best performing method, whereas CNN is not conspicuous in either metric. We further compared MLP against each of the other six methods using a single-tailed Wilcoxon\u2019s Signed Rank Test, finding that MLP significantly outperformed CNN, NB, RF, and SVM in Kappa (all p-values <\u20090.001) and it significantly outperformed CNN, MLR, LDA, and NB in ACC (all p-values <\u20090.01) (Fig. 4b). Combining the test results for Kappa and ACC, we conclude that MLP defeated each of the six competitor models, no matter whether the competitor is older (MLR, LDA, and NB) or relatively modern (RF, SVM, and CNN).\n\nFig. 4\nPerformance of MLP, CNN, and five classical machine learning models across 37 datasets. A boxplots of 37 performance values for each method. From left to right, methods are sorted by descending mean performance. B Relative performance comparison between MLP and any one of the other six methods. Each line connects the performance values of two methods on the same dataset. Five colors are used to distinguish the five dataset groups. *p\u2009<\u20090.01. ** p\u2009<\u20090.001. ***p\u2009<\u20090.0001\nWithin the TCGA (cancer vs normal) scenario, BRCA (breast cancer) had the largest number of cancer patients and thus was often chosen for elaborated analyses. We performed an investigation of class-imbalance robustness on a series of datasets originating from BRCA. The BRCA dataset contains 112 normal samples and 1093 tumor samples. From this full dataset, we derived a series of 10 datasets with increasing tumor vs normal ratio (112 tumor vs 112 normal, 224 tumor vs 112 normal, \u2026 1090 tumor vs 112 normal). The performance values of each method, in Kappa and ACC, were calculated under each imbalance ratio, and the average performance values of each method were connected to reveal a possible trend over increasing imbalanced ratios (Fig.\u00a05). While all methods had decent ACC values (>\u20090.88) for all class-imbalance ratios, CNN had excessive Kappa fluctuations across the surveyed range (Fig. 5). Particularly, at imbalance ratios 4 and 7, the average Kappa of CNN dropped to near zero. These absurdly low average Kappa values demonstrated the unstable performance of CNN under class imbalance. For example, the five repetitive datasets at tumor vs normal ratio 4 returned 0.88, 0.25, \u2212\u20093.04, 0.86, and 0.71 in Kappa values. The unstable Kappa values further proved that CNN is not an ideal machine learning method for classification using numerical matrix-formed omics data.\n\nFig. 5\nClassification performance over incremental positive-to-negative class ratios. Each data point represents an average value over five repetitive trials. Note that negative Kappa values were truncated at 0. MLP_1L, an MLP architecture of one hidden layer having 128\u2009units. MLP_2L, an MLP architecture of two hidden layers having 128\u2009units on both hidden layers. MLP_1L and MLP_2L precisely map to structures\u00a01L_128U and 2L_128U in Additional file 1: Table S1\nUsing a balanced BRCA RNA-seq dataset (with a 1:1 tumor vs normal ratio), we studied the influence of inaccurate class labeling on classification performance. We randomly selected a portion of equal-sized positive examples and negative examples in the training dataset and let them undergo random shuffling of class labels. Note that the class labels of the testing dataset were not altered. The samples undergoing label shuffling accounted for 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50% of the training data, thus generating 0%, ~\u20095%, ~\u200910%, ~\u200915%, ~\u200920%, and ~\u200925% mislabeled training samples. The mislabeling was repeated three times to generate three repetitive datasets for each inaccuracy level. The performance of each method was summarized across cross-validation datasets and aggregated over the repetitive swapping trials. Grouped barplots present the comparative results in terms of aggregated Kappa and ACC (Fig.\u00a06). As expected, for all methods the classification performance declines as proportion of the mislabeling increased in the training dataset. Surprisingly, even with a quarter of training data points wrongly labeled, all methods preserve good ACC (>\u20090.81) and acceptable Kappa (>\u20090.63).\n\nFig. 6\nClassification performance over incremental fractions of swapped class labels in training data. MLP_1L and MLP_2L precisely map to structures\u00a01L_128U and 2L_128U in Additional file 1: Table S1\nWe empirically evaluated the computation complexity of various machine learning models on the CKD positive ion metabolomics dataset. We derived five cross-validation datasets where each contained a randomly sampled 562 or 563 subjects for training data and the remaining 141 or 140 subjects for testing data. All five classical machine learning models, along with one instance of CNN and four instances of MLP were tested (Table\u00a01). All classical classifiers used a trivial computation time as compared to deep learning models, which consumed tens of thousands times more computation time than the swiftest model LDA. MLP models cost slightly less computation time than CNN. Increasing the depth of MLP models marginally increased the computation time.Table 1\nElapsed computation time (in seconds) for various machine learning models. The positive Kidney dataset was used as the test dataset. All classifiers were implemented on a desktop personal computer with an Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae CPU E5\u20131650 v4 processor of 3.6\u2009GHz and a random access memory of 32\u2009GB\nDeep learning is finding more and more exciting applications in several domains of bioinformatics [1]. Nevertheless, phenotype classification using numerical matrix-formed omics data has received insufficient attention from deep learning practitioners. Thus, we carried out a survey of various architectures of MLPs and CNNs to pinpoint the most optimal configuration(s) for phenotype classification using RNA-seq and high throughput metabolomics data. Because of the vast computation load necessitated by a large number of tested datasets (Table\u00a02), we had to apply a simple cross-validation schema for assessing seven methods across 93 datasets. In real construction and evaluation of a specific classifier, usually two layers of model validation are required, namely the internal cross-validation and the external independent validation [26]. Secondly, we included both binary classification and multi-class classification problems in our survey, and adopted ACC and Cohen\u2019s Kappa as performance measures because they could handle multi-class problems in the same way as binary problems. The choice of best performance measures is an open question, especially in the multi-class context. Other than Cohen\u2019s Kappa, Matthew\u2019s Correlation Coefficient [26] might be a good measure as well, which could be included as an alternative to Kappa in future evaluation studies.Table 2\nFive groups of omics datasets used for testing classification models\n\naFive repetitive sets of positive subjects were randomly sampled from the full TCGA samples to match with the negative dataset.

(PDF 807 kb)", "s12864-019-5511-x": "In wine fermentation starter cultures, the blending of non-Saccharomyces yeast with Saccharomyces cerevisiae to improve the complexity of wine has become common practice, but data regarding the impact of co-cultivation on yeast physiology and on genetic and metabolic regulation remain limited. Here we describe a transcriptomic analysis of mixed fermentations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Lachancea thermotolerans. The fermentations were carried out in carefully controlled environmental conditions in a bioreactor to reduce transcriptomic responses that would be due to factors other than the presence of the second species.The transcriptomic data revealed that both yeast species showed a clear response to the presence of the other. Affected genes primarily belonged to two groups: genes whose expression can be linked to the competition for certain trace elements such as copper and iron, as well as genes required for cell wall structure and integrity. Furthermore, the data revealed divergent transcriptional responses with regard to carbon metabolism in response to anoxic conditions.The results suggest that the mixed fermentation created a more competitive and stressful environment for the two species than single strain fermentations independently from total biomass, i.e. competition between cells of the same species is less stressful, or may present a different set of challenges, than interspecies competition. The changes in cell wall and adhesion properties encoding genes suggest that the adjustment of physical contact between cells may play a direct role in the response to the presence of competing species.During crushing of grapes, grape juice is exposed to air and becomes saturated with oxygen. Oxygen may also be discretely introduced into the wine fermentation process at various stages in amounts ranging from 2\u2009mg\u2009L\u2212\u20091 to 6\u2009mg\u2009L\u2212\u20091 depending on the method employed [1, 2]. Most of the oxygen is rapidly consumed by yeast cells, and concomitant CO2 production has a negative impact on oxygen dissolution, creating an anaerobic environment [1]. Several yeast species that constitute the wine fermentation community including members of the genera Saccharomyces, Torulaspora, Hanseniaspora, Lachancea, Pichia, Candida and Starmerella are facultative anaerobes that can grow and survive under these conditions. However, most of the non-Saccharomyces yeasts have high oxygen demands and low fermentation capacity compared to Saccharomyces species, particularly Saccharomyces cerevisiae [3\u20135]. Consequently, such species are used in mixed cultures with S. cerevisiae to ensure complete conversion of grape sugars to ethanol, CO2 and other metabolites that constitute the wine fermentation bouquet. This practice has gained tremendous interest in the global wine industry over the past decade, mainly due to improved wine flavour and aroma complexity, as well as potential reduction in ethanol levels, resulting from the underlying yeast-yeast interactions [6\u201312]. Consequently, understanding the interaction between Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces yeasts has become a central focus of ecological and of wine-related research. The nature of some of the ecological interactions between two yeast species have been previously evaluated. The data show that in mixed fermentation of S. cerevisiae and non-Saccharomyces yeasts, S. cerevisiae displays antagonistic interaction towards non-Saccharomyces yeasts such as Torulaspora delbrueckii, Hanseniaspora guilliermondii, Lachancea thermotolerans and Kluyveromyces lactis [13\u201315]. Early studies revealed that presence of S. cerevisiae cells at a high concentration causes cellular death in T. delbrueckii and L. thermotolerans [13]. These studies were subsequently followed by pioneering work attributing this antagonism to direct cell-cell contact as well as the production of antimicrobial peptides by S. cerevisiae [15, 16]. The data strongly suggest the existence of specific physical and metabolic interactions between yeast species, but do not provide any insights about the molecular mechanism behind such interactions, and little is known about the molecular factors influencing the response of any yeast species to the presence of another species. Such studies are challenging because of the complexity of multispecies systems and of ecological interactions. In particular, very few investigations have thus far been published reporting genome-wide data sets for such interactions, and most of these studies have primarily been reporting on the response of S. cerevisiae to the presence of another species. For instance, DNA microarray-based transcriptome analyses and mass spectrometry-based proteome analyses have been used to study the interaction between yeast and bacteria as well as between S. cerevisiae and non-Saccharomyces yeasts under oenological conditions [17\u201324]. Furthermore, these studies have usually relied on batch fermentation conditions. Such conditions make it difficult to differentiate the relative impact of the continuous changes in media composition from the specific response of one yeast species to the presence of the other.In the current study, we evaluated the transcriptomic response of L. thermotolerans and S. cerevisiae in mixed fermentations when compared to single strain cultures in the same environmental conditions. We selected L. thermotolerans as a non-Saccharomyces wine yeast as that yeast has already been commercialised for use in mixed starter fermentations. Mixed culture fermentation with L. thermotolerans are known for leading to enhanced concentration of higher alcohols (particularly 2-phenylethanol), l-lactic acid, glycerol and esters, while in some conditions also resulting in lower ethanol wines [10]. The genome of this yeast has been sequenced and the genome sequence has been partially annotated. As demonstrated in previous studies [3, 5], oxygen enhances the growth and persistence of L. thermotolerans in mixed starter fermentations. To better characterise the molecular nature of the interactions, we used a controlled bioreactor system that allowed maintenance of two species in fermentation with continuous in-flow and out-flow of medium. The conditions were set to ensure that the total biomass of mixed and single species fermentations, and the environmental factors that strongly impact gene transcription in fermentative conditions such as nutrient availability, oxygen, ethanol and hexose concentrations, were maintained at similar levels in all fermentations. These settings should restrict the transcriptomic response to factors linked to the presence of a second species.The current study aimed to unravel transcriptional responses of S. cerevisiae and L. thermotolerans in mixed culture fermentation. By manipulating dilution rates in a continuous culture, the two yeasts were maintained at approximately equal concentrations for 24\u2009h. L. thermotolerans transcripts accounted for 24% of the sequences reads in anaerobic mixed cultures and \u2248 8% in aerobic mixed cultures. However, there was sufficient depth in the anaerobic mixed fermentation transcriptome to extract key genes that are influenced by mixing and interaction between S. cerevisiae and L. thermotolerans. Related studies have employed strategies, which only allowed for analysis of early transcriptional responses to mixed culture or analyses of S. cerevisiae transcriptional response only. For instance, Tronchoni et al. [25] first pre-cultured S. cerevisiae and the T. delbrueckii in separate bioreactors and then mixed the two at equal volumes, followed by withdrawal of samples for RNAseq before the cells started proliferating and in the early exponential phase to avoid over-representation of only one species. In contrast, Barbosa et al. [17] conducted mixed-culture fermentations of S. cerevisiae with Hanseniaspora guilliermondii in a typical wine fermentation batch set-up, extracted RNA at different fermentation stages and only focused on the transcriptional response of S. cerevisiae. The specific conditions also aimed at maintaining relatively stable environmental conditions and cell densities during the co-culture of the two species by using a set-up similar to a continuous fermentation. This strategy was intended to limit the transcriptomic signature to the interaction-relevant responses by reducing genetic responses that would be due to the continuous dynamic adaptation to changing conditions that are prevalent in batch cultures [17, 25]. The relatively limited number of S. cerevisiae genes that are significantly affected by the mixed culture conditions in our study when compared to other such data sets suggests that this strategy has succeeded, and that the highlighted genes are indeed the core of a perpetual interaction response.The transcriptomic data revealed divergent responses of the two yeasts to the interaction between mixing and anoxia. These conditions elicited a stronger response in L. thermotolerans. Indeed, on average L. thermotolerans displayed a marked up-regulation of genes associated with cell aggregation, cell death and response to osmotic stress. Furthermore, several genes encoding catalase, superoxide dismutases, and peroxidases were significantly up-regulated, suggesting that L. thermotolerans cells are experiencing some level of oxidative stress. This is not surprising since other studies have demonstrated that hypoxia and anoxia induce transient oxidative stress in other yeasts such as S. cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces lactis [26]. Our data also suggest that L. thermotolerans redirects its metabolic flux from glycolysis to the PPP similar to K. lactis and Pichia pastoris [26, 27].Under anoxic conditions, mitochondrial and cytochrome c activities were down-regulated in both yeasts. However, differences were observed in the up-regulated processes, where seemingly S. cerevisiae increased its sterol uptake while L. thermotolerans increased the expression of genes required for ergosterol biosynthesis including those encoding enzymes that catalyse oxygen-dependent reactions e.g. ERG3, ERG11 and ERG25. This induction of oxygen-dependent genes has been observed in other yeasts including S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris albeit transiently, and has been attributed to cells adjusting to anaerobic conditions following cultivations in oxygenated environments [27].In the current study, it was evident that in mixed-culture fermentation, S. cerevisiae increased the expression of iron and copper acquisition systems. Indeed, the data show that FRE1, FRE7, ENB1, FIT2, CTR1 and CTR3 were significantly upregulated. Fre1p, Enb1p and Fit2p form a cluster of proteins required for the uptake of siderophores. Fre1p has broad substrate specificity and can catalyse the reduction of iron-sidephore chelates such as ferrichrome, ferrioxamine B and enterobactin. Enb1p exclusively recognizes and transports enterobactin, while Fit2p contributes to the retention of siderophore-iron chelates in the cell wall [28]. Regarding copper uptake, Ctr1p and Ctr3p together with Fre1p and Fre7p are important in high affinity uptake of copper ions. Their expression is a cellular response to inadequate intracellular copper levels [29]. Conversely, L. thermotolerans shown a down-regulation of genes encoding nonreductive (copper independent) siderophore-iron transport (ARN1, FIT2, FIT3), as well as those required for reductive iron uptake (FRE3) and copper-dependent iron import (FTR1 and FET3). Fet3p is multicopper oxidase that also exhibit ferrous oxidase activity and forms a high-affinity iron transport complex with Ftr1p as well as Fet5p and Fth1p [30], which were not differentially expressed in the current study. Hodgins-Davis et al. [31] showed that FTR1 and FET3 were uniformly downregulated under copper deprivation in different S. cerevisiae strains. Since high-affinity copper and iron acquisition systems are homeostatically regulated, we can infer from the current data that both yeasts experience the growth conditions to be limited in bioavailable iron and copper, and therefore activate different systems to allow them to thrive in such environments. In S. cerevisiae, high expression of CTR1 gene is reported to be induced when copper levels are below 10\u2009\u03bcM [30], while high concentrations of copper result in down-regulation of both CTR1 and CTR3 [29]. The synthetic grape juice medium used in the current study contains 0.11\u2009\u03bcM copper. Copper is required for iron homeostasis in yeast and the link between copper and iron metabolism in S. cerevisiae is well recognized [29]. Evidently, in mixed-culture fermentation, S. cerevisiae competes with L. thermotolerans by activating a full set of genes to acquire different forms of iron from the environment and to store it in the cells in bound-form (e.g. ferrichrome).Our data show a strong response to cell wall integrity in both yeasts in mixed fermentation when compared to single species fermentation. Indeed, both yeast species up-regulate genes that are involved in cell wall integrity under stress conditions although different genes and processes are induced. Indeed, under anaerobic mechanisms in mixed fermentations. In particular, S. cerevisiae shows a significant up-regulation of 5 PAU genes (PAU5, PAU9, PAU12, PAU17, PAU24). These genes have been reported to play an important role in promoting fitness under anaerobic and fermentative condition as well as in interactions between natural strains of S. cerevisiae [32, 33]. In particular, PAU5 was shown to play a key role in competition by providing protection against killer toxins [33]. The abundance of the PAU genes in the S. cerevisiae transcriptome in the presence of L. thermotolerans could therefore suggest that they also play a role in interactions with other yeast species which are phylogenetically closely related to S. cerevisiae. Indeed, in another study, Tronchoni et al. [25] reported an induction of 20 of the 24 PAU genes in the primary response of S. cerevisiae to Torulaspora delbrueckii. Our data suggest that these genes are indeed specifically associated with yeast-yeast interactions. Interestingly, in the mixed fermentation under anaerobic conditions, L. thermotolerans increases the expression of endoglucanases (e.g. BGL2), while simultaneously reinforcing and stabilizing its cell wall, as evident in the up-regulation of genes involved in the biogenesis, assembly and maintenance of glucan and chitin. The overexpression of BGL2 in S. cerevisiae has been shown to retard growth, which could suggest that L. thermotolerans compensates for this possible impact by strengthening the cell wall. In contrast, S. cerevisiae protects itself through the upregulation of PAU genes, which are amongst the genes that encode cell wall proteins thought to be important in cell wall remodelling and maintenance of cell wall integrity during stress [32]. In the current study, the recovery of L. thermotolerans reads in mixed culture fermentations was consitently lower than those of S. cerevisiae (Additional file 1: Table S1). We may deduce from our data that this alludes to poor RNA extraction which could partly be due to cell wall thickness and rigidity, that rendered the L. thermotolerans cells less sensitive to mechanical disruption. However, this will require further evaluation.Our data suggest that in mixed culture fermentation under anaerobic conditions, L. thermotolerans specifically increases the expression of genes involved in the metabolism of four amino acids viz. cysteine, methionine, phenylalanine and \u03b2-alanine. The up-regulation of cystein and methionine-related metabolic activities may suggest that sulphur-related processes are directly affected by co-culture conditions. Furthermore, all genes involved in the conversion of phenylalanine to phenylethanol were up-regulated. These data support our previous findings which showed that L. thermotolerans produces high levels of phenylethanol in monoculture, and to enhance phenylethanol production in mixed fermentations with S. cerevisiae [5]. This trait seems common in various L. thermotolerans since other studies have reported increased levels of phenylethanol in combinations of different strains of L. thermotolerans and S. cerevisiae [10, 11].Overall, our study reveals divergent molecular signatures underlying the performance of S. cerevisiae and L. thermotolerans in mixed culture fermentation. The data shows that S. cerevisiae is better able to deal with the fermentation environment possibly due to its efficient competitive uptake of sterols, copper and iron, accompanied by cell wall remodelling to accommodate additional mannoproteins and PAU proteins. These strategies allow the yeast to regulate membrane fluidity and cell wall porosity, and withstand an anaerobic, high ethanol environment. Conversely, the fermentation environment seems highly toxic to L. thermotolerans, which mainly features a molecular signature that is characterized by detoxification, cell aggregation and cell death associated genes. The strong cell wall-related responses in both species suggest the importance of this organelle in the cellular response to other species. In particular, the data support that the regulation of adhesion properties may play a central role in modulating the physical and ecological interactions between species [16].The data are also a confirmation of many studies that have reported a rapid decline of L. thermotolerans in wine fermentation especially in mixed cultures with S. cerevisiae. The study also underlines the usefulness of a global approach to the study of yeast-yeast interactions to shed light on the molecular basis of yeast dynamics during wine fermentation. Besides a general contribution to a better understanding of yeast ecological interactions, the data will be useful for the rational development of mixed-starter cultures in the winemaking industry.S. cerevisiae (Cross evolution-285) was obtained from Lallemand SAS (Blagnac, France), while L. thermotolerans (IWBT-Y1240) was obtained from the culture collection of the Institute for Wine Biotechnology (Stellenbosch University). Yeast strains were maintained cryogenically (\u2212\u200980\u2009\u00b0C) and were reactivated by streaking out on YPD agar plates containing (per litre) 10\u2009g yeast extract, 20\u2009g peptone and 20\u2009g glucose and 20\u2009g bacteriological agar. Cultures were stored at 4\u2009\u00b0C for short-term use.Batch fermentations were performed in synthetic grape juice medium containing (per litre) 100\u2009g glucose, 100\u2009g fructose (Merck), 1\u2009g yeast extract (Oxoid), 0.3\u2009g citric acid, 5\u2009g\u2009l-malic acid, 5\u2009g\u2009l-tartaric acid, 0.4\u2009g MgSO4, 5\u2009g KH2PO4, 0.2\u2009g NaCl, 0.05\u2009g MnSO4 (Sigma-Aldrich) and anaerobic factors (ergosterol 10\u2009mg (Sigma-Aldrich), tween 80 0.5\u2009mL (Merck)) [34, 35]. Fermentations were conducted in 1.3\u2009L BioFlo 110 bench top bioreactors (New Brunswick, NJ, USA) using 900\u2009mL of final working volume, a temperature of 25\u2009\u00b0C and an agitation speed of 200\u2009rpm. Fermentations were performed under two conditions: anaerobic and aerobic at 5% (0.41\u2009mg\u2009L\u2212\u20091) dissolved oxygen (DO). The anaerobic conditions were created by initially sparging N2 to bring down the DO level to 0%, and then to minimize diffusion of atmospheric oxygen into the cultures, the entire fermentation set-up was equipped with Norprene tubing. The 5% DO level was maintained through the supplementary addition of 4 gasses (CO2, N2, O2 and compressed air) whenever required, using an automated gas flow controller. The DO levels in the cultures were monitored with an oxygen electrode.In order to maintain similar environmental conditions in mixed and single-culture fermentations, a system similar to continuous fermentation using continuous in-flow and out-flow of the medium was optimised for single and mixed fermentations. Samples for RNAseq analysis were withdrawn at 48\u2009h when total viable cell count was similar between the mixed and single culture fermentation. The feeding medium contained glucose and fructose, each at 50\u2009g\u2009L\u2212\u20091. The working volume was maintained at 0.7\u2009L using a peristaltic effluent pump. All fermentations were conducted in duplicate.Serial dilutions of the cell suspensions were performed with 0.9% (w/v) NaCl. One hundred microliter samples were spread on YPD agar and incubated at 30\u2009\u00b0C for 2\u20133\u2009days. For yeast enumeration in mixed culture fermentations, both species were distinguished based on colony morphology. Colony counts were performed on plates with 30\u2013300 colonies.Supernatants were obtained by centrifuging cell suspensions at 5000\u00d7g for 5\u2009min. The concentrations of fructose, glucose, acetaldehyde and acetic acid were measured using specific enzymatic kits, Enytec\u2122 Fluid d-fructose, glucose, acetic acid (Thermo Fisher Scientific Oy, Finland), Boehringer Mannheim / R-Biopharm-acetaldehyde (R-Biopharm AG, Darmstadt) and analyzed using Arena 20XT photometric analyzer (Thermo Electron Oy, Helsinki, Finland). Ethanol was analysed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on an AMINEX HPX-87H ion exchange column using 5\u2009mM H2SO4 (Sigma-Aldrich) as the mobile phase as described by Rossouw et al. [24]. The major volatiles were extracted with diethyl ether and analysed by Gas Chromatography with Flame Ionization Detection (GC-FID) as described in previously [36].Cell samples for RNA-sequencing were obtained from both single and mixed culture fermentations (anaerobic and aerobic, respectively) at 48\u2009h when population and sugar levels were approximately same in all fermentations. Total RNA extractions were performed according to the hot phenol method [37]. Concentration and purity of RNA were determined by spectrophotometry and integrity was confirmed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano Assay (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The RNA samples with RNA integrity number (RIN) more than 8, and 280:260 ratios more than 2 were further used for the RNA-sequencing purpose. Library preparation and sequencing was performed by VIB Nucleomics core (KU, Leuven (Belgium). Complementary DNA (cDNA) library was generated using TruSeq\u00ae Library Prep Kit v2. Paired-end reads were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq platform.Low quality reads (< Q20), polyA-reads as well as ambiguous reads (containing N) were removed using FastX 0.0.13 [38]. Furthermore, reads shorter than 35\u2009bp were removed with ShortRead 1.16.3 [39] and adapters on the remaining reads were trimmed with cutadapt 1.7.1 [40].Annotation of genomic features was performed using the reference genomes of S. cerevisiae S288c and L. thermotolerans CBS6340. In the case of L. thermotolerans unknown genes were identified by the homology with the S. cerevisiae S288c genome. Reads from L. thermotolerans and S. cerevisiae monoculture fermentation samples were aligned to the reference genomes of the two yeasts with TopHat v2.0.13 [41]; and reads that were non-primary mapping or had a mapping quality \u226420, were removed. Subsequently, cross-mapping between S. cerevisiae S288c and L. thermotolerans was evaluated to determine the impact of merging the genomes. Cross-mapping between the two yeasts was found to be less than 1%; consequently, pre-processed reads of all fermentations were aligned to the reference genome of S288cplusLT. The obtained bam files were further converted in to gff files to analyse the data further. The number of reads in the alignments that overlap with gene features were counted using htseq-count 0.6.1p1 [42]. Genes for which all samples had less than 1 count-per-million were removed and full quantile normalization using the EDASeq package from Bioconductor was applied to correct for sample-specific variation typically introduced by differences in library size and RNA composition. Transcript abundance was measured in Fragments Per Kilobase of exon per Million mapped reads (FPKM).For each gene the coefficients \u03b2 were estimated with the edgeR 3.8.6 package of Bioconductor [43], by fitting a negative binomial generalized linear model (GLM) [44]. Offsets were used to estimate the models. Subsequently, the model estimates were used to compute contrasts of primary interest which were (i) MIX vs PURE (MIX effect) (ii) AN vs AR (AN effect), (iii) the interaction between MIX and AN effect (INT), (iv) MIX vs PURE, only in AR samples, (v) MIX vs PURE, only in AN samples and (vi) AN vs AR, only in MIX samples. The differential expression was tested with a GLM likelihood ratio test, also implemented in the edgeR 3.8.6 package. The resulting p-values were corrected for multiple testing with Benjamini-Hochberg to control the false discovery rate (FDR) [45]. Genes with an absolute log2-ratio larger than 1 and an adjusted p-value <\u20090.05 were considered differentially expressed.Adenosine di-phosphateAnaerobicAerobicAdenosine tri-phosphateBiological functionBiological processesCellular componentComplementary DNAColony forming unitsDifferentially expressed genesDeoxyribonucleic acidDissolved oxygenFold changeFalse discovery rateFragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped readsGas chromatography with flame ionization detectionGene expression omnibusGeneralized linear modelGene ontologyHigh performance liquid chromatographyInstitute for wine biotechnologyKyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes\nLachancea thermotolerans\nMillion baseNicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphateNational Centre for Biotechnology InformationNational Research FoundationPrincipal component analysisRNA integrity numberRibonucleic acid\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\nTranscripts per millionYeast potato dextroseThis research for the present study was funded by the National Research Foundation (NRF) Grant Unique Number 83471 and the National Research Foundation-Technology and Human Resources for Industry Programme (grant TP14070874355).

Indeed, when such studies are carried out in standard batch fermentation conditions, both species continuously modify gene expression to respond to the dynamic environment. Furthermore, population evolution leads to continuous change in the level of mutual exposure. In such conditions, any specific transcriptional response of one species to the presence of the other species will be hidden within a broader transcriptional response to changes in the environment. To overcome this problem, and to focus the investigation on the transcriptomic signature of the interaction between species, a system with similarity to a chemostat was optimised. The specific growth rate of S. cerevisiae and L. thermotolerans monocultures under anaerobic conditions, was found to be 0.2\u2009h\u2212\u20091 at a dilution rate of 0.1\u2009h\u2212\u20091 and 0.17\u2009h\u2212\u20091 at a dilution rate of 0.075\u2009h\u2212\u20091, respectively, and similar cell concentrations were obtained (Table\u00a01). In order to avoid a washout of L. thermotolerans in mixed fermentations, the cultures were co-inoculated and cultivated in batch for 30\u2009h, and then switched to continuous mode at a dilution rate of 0.1\u2009h\u2212\u20091 for the anaerobic fermentation. In contrast, under aerobic conditions, the two yeasts displayed similar specific growth rates and reached comparable cell concentrations under the same dilution rate (Table 1). Consequently, the same dilution rate could be applied in the mixed culture fermentations. The aim of this optimisation was to ensure similar population densities and similar growth medium composition in both monocultures and mixed culture fermentations. As illustrated in Fig.\u00a01, under these optimised conditions, the species display similar growth rates in single and mixed fermentations, and after 48\u2009h of continuous culture, the total number of cells, as well as the sugar concentrations were similar in all the fermentations. The viable counts obtained from samples used for RNA extraction and expression analysis, showed that the cell concentrations of both species were \u2248 108\u2009CFU\u2009mL\u2212\u20091 in both mono- and mixed-cultures (Table 1).Table 1\nA summary of the dilutions rates applied to maintain similar cell concentrations, as well as the chemical fermentation parameters at the time of sampling for transcriptome analysis\n\n\nFig. 1\nFermentation kinetics and population dynamics of S. cerevisiae and L. thermotolerans in single and mixed fermentation under anaerobic (left panel) and aerobic (right panel) fermentation conditions. The red line indicates the start of continuous culture, the arrows indicate the sampling point\nThe RNA-sequencing was performed for two biological replicates of each fermentation. RNA extractions were performed on samples collected after the two species were in contact for 48\u2009h and had maintained similar cell concentrations (Fig. 1). This was done to allow sufficient metabolic interaction under conditions akin to a steady state. After filtering and trimming, RNAseq samples contained between 11 and 15\u2009Mb total reads (Additional file 1: Table S1). These reads were mapped to the S288CplusLT chimeric genome which was generated after cross-mapping between S. cerevisiae and L. thermotolerans was found to be less than 1%. The data show that the mixed culture transcriptome had low coverage of L. thermotolerans. In particular, the oxygenated fermentation samples generated a total sum of \u2248 2\u2009Mb\u2009L. thermotolerans reads between the two biological replicates, which is below the recommended threshold. Nevertheless, the data were considered useful for certain analyses. One of the S. cerevisiae anaerobic monocultures (Sc.AN.2) appeared to be mixed and was therefore not considered in subsequent analyses. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) performed on normalized TPM data showed that the samples clustered together in a yeast and treatment specific manner, with only minor variations between the independent biological replicates (Fig.\u00a02). L. thermotolerans displayed higher levels of transcriptomic change under each condition compared to S. cerevisiae, as evident in the separation of the samples along PC2. The statistical analysis was done using Benjamini-Hochberg on all highly-expressed genes to control the FDR.\n\nFig. 2\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) plot of the biological replicates of transcripts from Lachancea thermotolerans (Lt) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) monocultures and mixed cultures (Lt.MIX and Sc.MIX) under aerobic (AR) and anaerobic (AN) conditions\nThe effect of mixing (MIX) on the gene transcription in S. cerevisiae and L. thermotolerans was assessed by comparing the transcriptome of the mixed cultures to the monocultures under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions (i.e Sc-Lt-AN and Sc-Lt-AR compared to Sc-AN, Sc-AR, Lt-AN and Lt-AR). Genes uniquely differentially expressed in the mixed fermentations compared to monocultures were identified (Additional file 2: Table S2). The genes differentially expressed under anaerobic conditions (AN) were determined by comparing the anaerobic cultures to the aerobic cultures (i.e Sc-Lt-AN, Sc-AN and Lt-AN compared to Sc-Lt-AR, Sc-AR and Lt-AR). Furthermore, common genes differentially expressed in both MIX and AN sets were considered to be affected by the interaction (INT) between mixing and anoxia (Additional file 2: Table S2). For the initial global analysis, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were visualized by overlaying the data on the Biocyc Omics dashboard. Overall, the interaction between mixing and anoxia (INT) elicited a stronger response in L. thermotolerans than in S. cerevisiae (Fig.\u00a03). In S. cerevisiae, only the degradation of secondary metabolites as well as the biosynthesis of metabolic regulators were significantly up-regulated. These included TSL1, TPS1, TPS2 and TPS3, involved in trehalose biosynthesis (Additional file 3: Table S3). Conversely, L. thermotolerans displayed an up-regulation of several biological processes most notably detoxification, cell death, adhesion as well as response to stimulus (Fig. 3). The highly up-regulated detoxification and adhesion-related genes in L. thermotolerans included ALD2, ALD5, SOD1, SOD2, DLD1, CTT1, and HSP12, FLO9, NRG1, SDS3 and CCW12, respectively (Additional file 3: Table S3).\n\nFig. 3\nOverall comparison of transcriptional response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) and Lachancea thermotolerans (Lt) to mixed-culture environment (Sc-mix and Lt-mix), and to the combined effect of mixing and anoxia (Sc-int and Lt-int)\nThe anaerobic and aerobic mixed cultures (Sc-Lt-AN vs Sc-Lt-AR) were compared to assess the transcriptional response of S. cerevisiae and L. thermotolerans to anoxia in a mixed fermentation setting. Considering DEGs with log2FC\u2009\u2265\u20091.5 or\u2009\u2264\u2009\u2212\u20091.5, only 8 genes were up-regulated genes and 22 down-regulated genes were common between S. cerevisiae and L. thermotolerans (Fig.\u00a04). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment showed that cation transport, electron transport chain, generation of precursor metabolites and energy, were some of the highly down-regulated biological processes in both yeasts. By contrast, biological processes enriched in up-regulated genes were distinct between the two yeasts. For instance, in S. cerevisiae, sterol transport, cell wall organization and associated processes were enriched while in L. thermotolerans oxidation-reduction process, carbohydrate catabolism as well as cellular lipid biosynthetic processes were enriched (Fig. 4).\n\nFig. 4\nA Venn diagram showing the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) commonly regulated in S. cerevisiae and L. thermotolerans in a mixed-culture fermentation in response to anoxia compared to aerobic mixed-culture. The enriched GO terms reflecting the biological processes associated with the DEGs are presented in the associated tables\nSince the mixed aerobic fermentation samples contained a low percentage of L. thermotolerans reads and transcripts, which reduced the power to detect differentially expressed genes, we only considered the mixed culture fermentations under anaerobic conditions for further analyses. The transcriptional response of the two yeasts to mixing was analysed by comparing the mixed culture transcriptome to the monocultures in these conditions (i.e. Sc-Lt-AN vs Sc-AN and Lt-AN). The data revealed that only 62 genes were differentially expressed (31 up-regulated and 31 down-regulated) in S. cerevisiae in response to the presence of L. thermotolerans. In contrast, in L. thermotolerans 687 genes were differentially expressed, amongst them 639 (408 up-regulated and 231 down-regulated) which could be annotated to S. cerevisiae homologs. The DEGs were independently analysed for enriched GO terms at the three hierarchical categories (biological process, molecular function and cellular component). Up-regulated genes in S. cerevisiae were mainly associated with copper and iron ion import, as well as iron ion homeostasis, while the down-regulated genes were associated with cell aggregation and flocculation (Table\u00a02). The genes significantly up-regulated in the copper and iron homeostasis were FRE1 and FRE7 which encode ferric reductases, CTR1 and CTR3 encoding high affinity copper transporters, as well as ENB1 and FIT2 that encode an endosomal ferric enterobactin transporter and a mannoprotein, respectively. In contrast, FLO10, FLO11 and SAG1 required for pseudohyphal and invasive growth, as well as flocculation and agglutination, respectively, were down-regulated (Fig.\u00a05). In L. thermotolerans, biological processes associated with filamentous growth in response to starvation were enriched with up-regulated genes, while processes associated with iron assimilation, iron ion homeostasis as well as siderophore transport were enriched with down-regulated genes (Table\u00a03). The data show that transcriptional factors and repressors (e.g. MIG1, MIG2, OPY2) that are likely involved in the regulation of filamentous growth were up-regulated, while FTR1, FRE3, FET3 and ARN1 encoding a high affinity iron permease, ferric reductase, ferro-O2-oxidoreductase, as well as ARN family transporter for siderophore-iron chelates, respectively, were down-regulated (Fig. 5).Table 2\nEnriched GO terms (Biological Processes (BP), Biological Function (BF) and Cellular component (CC)) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in anaerobic mixed fermentations\n\n\nFig. 5\nDifferentially expressed genes involved in enriched biological processes in S. cerevisiae and L. thermotolerans in response to mixing under anaerobic conditions compared to aerobic conditions\nTable 3\nEnriched GO terms (Biological Processes (BP), Biological Function (BF) and Cellular component (CC)) in Lachancea thermotolerans under anaerobic mixed fermentations\nWithin the category of Cellular component, GO enrichment revealed that the extracellular region and the cell wall were the most enriched cellular component GO terms in S. cerevisiae with both up- and down-regulated genes (Table 2). The enrichment is mainly associated with the up-regulation of mannoprotein encoding genes (FIT2 and FIT3) as well as the seripauperin protein encoding genes (PAU5, PAU12, PAU17 and PAU24) and down-regulation of FLO10, FLO11, SPO19, SAG1 and PHO5 (Fig.\u00a07). Conversely, in L. thermotolerans the cell wall was only enriched with up-regulated genes. The genes associated with this enrichment included KRE9, BGL2, DSE4, CWP1, PIR1, HSP150 (a paralog of PIR3), UTH1, and CRH1 (Fig.\u00a06) all required for cell wall biogenesis and stability, particularly \u03b2-glucan formation.\n\nFig. 6\nDEGs associated with the enrichment of the cellular component GO terms: cell wall and cell exterior\nThe DEGs were further mapped to terms in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG, http://www.kegg.jp/) database. No pathways were enriched in S. cerevisiae probably due to the limited number of genes (62) differentially expressed in response to mixing. Conversely, in L. thermotolerans out of the 639 annotated DEGs,116 up-regulated and 5 down-regulated genes revealed enriched KEGG pathways. As illustrated in Fig. 7, metabolic pathways, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites as well as microbial metabolism in diverse environments were the largest categories in the up-regulated genes. Furthermore, the data show that carbon metabolism as well as biosynthesis of amino acids were highly enriched. Moreover, the metabolism of \u03b2-alanine, phenylalanine, cysteine and methionine was enriched. However, not all the genes involved in the metabolic processes were significantly upregulated. For instance, in the \u03b2-alanine metabolism only PAN6 and GAD1 were significantly up-regulated, while ARO8 and AAT2, and CYS3, ARO8, MCY1 and AAT2, were significantly up-regulated in the phenylalanine and the cysteine and methionine metabolism, respectively (Additional file 4: Table S4). Amongst the down-regulated genes, fatty acid degradation as well as \u03b1-linoleic acid metabolism were the main enriched pathways.\n\nFig. 7\nKEGG pathways enriched in L. thermotolerans in mixed culture fermentation under anaerobic conditions compared to aerobic conditions\nFor the selection of differentially expressed genes statistical modelling was used to design the following experiments:\n\nAdditional file 1:\nTable S1.

Since most precancerous and cancerous tissues show signs of inflammation, chronic bacterial prostatitis has been hypothesized to be a possible etiology. However, establishing a causal relationship between microbial inflammation and PCa requires a comprehensive analysis of the prostate microbiome. The aim of this study was to characterize the microbiome in prostate tissue of PCa patients and investigate its association with tumour clinical characteristics as well as host expression profiles.The metagenome and metatranscriptome of tumour and the adjacent benign tissues were assessed in 65 Chinese radical prostatectomy specimens. Escherichia, Propionibacterium, Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas were abundant in both metagenome and metatranscriptome, thus constituting the core of the prostate microbiome. The biodiversity of the microbiomes could not be differentiated between the matched tumour/benign specimens or between the tumour specimens of low and high Gleason Scores. The expression profile of ten Pseudomonas genes was strongly correlated with that of eight host small RNA genes; three of the RNA genes may negatively associate with metastasis. Few viruses could be identified from the prostate microbiomes.This is the first study of the human prostate microbiome employing an integrated metagenomics and metatranscriptomics approach. In this Chinese cohort, both metagenome and metatranscriptome analyses showed a non-sterile microenvironment in the prostate of PCa patients, but we did not find links between the microbiome and local progression of PCa. However, the correlated expression of Pseudomonas genes and human small RNA genes may provide tantalizing preliminary evidence that Pseudomonas infection may impede metastasis.Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common malignant neoplasm among men in Western industrialized countries and its incidence is rapidly increasing in China. Globally there are 800,000 diagnoses and 300,000 deaths annually [1]. The aetiologies of the disease remain largely unknown. Since most precancerous and cancerous tissues show signs of inflammation, chronic bacterial prostatitis has been hypothesized to be a possible etiology [2\u20134]. In vitro cellular experiments have demonstrated that inflammation induced by Escherichia coli and Propionibacterium acnes can alter normal prostate epithelial cell differentiation and through this process inflammation accelerates the initiation of PCa with a basal cell origin [5\u20138]. Evidence also comes from epidemiological studies as up to 87% PCa patients have microbial DNA in their prostates. In particular, P. acnes, JC polyomavirus (JCV) and BK polyomavirus (BKV) have been more commonly detected in PCa patients than in controls [9\u201311].Most of the above findings were obtained by performing traditional nucleic acid amplification tests, such as quantitative real-time PCR and amplification of 16S rRNA in concert with plasmid cloning and Sanger sequencing. The advent of next generation sequencing has revolutionized the study of human microbiomes. The body sites that have been intensely studied include gut, skin, oral cavity, vagina, but prostate has been largely overlooked. To date, only two studies have applied massively parallel 16S rRNA sequencing for investigating the prostate microbiome [12, 13]. While these two studies confirmed that the prostate was a non-sterile environment and discovered numerous bacterial organisms that had not been reported in prostate tissue, their limited sample size (<\u200920 patients) made it difficult to establish a reproducible link between microbial pathogens and PCa. Meanwhile, the innate flaws of the 16\u2009s rRNA-based technologies, such as the amplification bias that may distort the bacterial composition, an inability to quantify the actual microbial load, as well as an inability to capture viruses that lack 16S rRNA, also preclude an accurate and complete characterization of prostate microbiome.To address these limitations, we applied a shotgun-based integrated metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis to a cohort of 65 Chinese PCa patients. Moreover, the availability of host transcriptome offers the possibility to explore the interaction between the host cancerous tissue and its microbiome.The information of patients and specimens is summarized in Additional\u00a0file\u00a01 [14]. Briefly, 65 PCa patients were recruited in this study, with an average age of 68.4\u2009\u00b1\u20097.3\u2009years old. Treatment-naive prostate tumour and matched benign tissues were collected from the radical prostatectomy series at Shanghai Changhai Hospital and Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. The intact prostate glands were delivered to the pathology laboratory under sterile conditions. H&E slides of frozen human tumour tissues and their matched benign tissues were examined by a pathologist and a urology pathologist to confirm histological diagnosis and Gleason Score. The frozen sections were then used for DNA/RNA isolation.DNA and RNA preparation and library construction has been described [14]. In detail, for DNA library construction, DNA was extracted by phenol-chloroform and purified by the ethanol precipitation method. Then 2\u2009\u03bcg of genomic DNA from each sample was fragmented using a Covaris Ultrasonicator\u00ae(Covaris, USA) to mean sizes of ~\u2009500\u2009bp. After fragmentation, the purified, randomly fragmented DNA was treated with a mix of T4 DNA polymerase, Klenow fragments, T4 polynucleotide kinase and dNTPs for repairing the ends by blunting and phosphorylation. The blunted DNA fragments were subsequently 3\u2032-adenylated using the Klenow (3\u2032-5\u2019exo) and ligated by T4 DNA ligase (Rapid) (Enzymatics, USA) to PE Index Adapters. After each step, the DNA was purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Germany).For RNA library construction, RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent and then treated with DNase I, RNase-free (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Ribosomal RNA was removed from total RNA by using Ribo-Zero\u00ae rRNA Removal Kit (Epicentre, USA). Then RNA was fragmented on Covaris Ultrasonicator\u00ae to mean sizes of ~\u2009200\u2009bp, and the first cDNA strand was synthesized from fragmented RNA using PrimeScript\u00ae RT reagent Kit (Takara Bio, Japan). After purification with the Ampure XP Beads to remove dNTPs, second-strand synthesis was performed by incubation with RNase H, DNA polymerase, and dNTPs that contain dUTP in place of dTTP. A single 3\u2032 \u2018A\u2019 base was added using Klenow (3\u2032-5\u2032 exo-) (Enzymatics, USA) and dATP to the end-repaired cDNA. Upon ligation with the PE Index Adaptors, the products were gel-recovered and subsequently digested with Uracil-N-Glycosylase (UNG) for removing the second-strand cDNA. Samples were then amplified by 15\u2009cycles of PCR with Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).All the constructed libraries were finally sequenced on HiSeq 2000 platform, producing 2\u2009\u00d7\u200990-bp paired-end reads.Raw reads that contained adaptor sequences, too many Ns (>\u200910%) and/or low quality base (>\u200950% bases with quality <\u20095) were removed. Clean reads were aligned to human reference genome hg19 using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA-MEM v0.7.5, http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/). PCR or sequencing optical duplicates were marked by Picard (v1.54, http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard).The aligned reads were removed, and the unmapped reads were then mapped by BWA to National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) full set of microbial reference genomes (Bacteria: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/microbes//; virus: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/GenomesGroup.cgi?taxid=10239&host=human).RepeatMasker (v4.0, http://www.repeatmasker.org) was used to identify repeat and low complexity reads. Any reads with three or more masked nucleotides were discarded for the next step. In order to further avoid false identification of bacterial reads which is mostly manifested as a large number of mapped reads being restricted to a few short genomic regions, the coverage uniformity of the bacterial genomes was assessed as described previously [15].The taxonomic abundance was measured by the number of reads assigned to each microbial genus. We hypothesize that each human cell in the specimens have equal amount of human DNA/RNA. Accordingly, the purpose of normalization in this study was to minimize the bias caused by differences in sequencing coverage across samples and to make the human DNA/RNA comparable between specimens. In detail, for the metagenome analysis, a scaling normalization was done by multiplying the read counts by a constant so that each specimen has 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009109 reads that were mapped to the human genome hg19. For the metatranscriptome analysis, a scaling normalization was done by multiplying the read counts by a constant so that each specimen has 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 reads that were mapped to the housekeeping gene GAPDH (ENSG00000111640). The numbers of raw and normalized reads are listed in Additional\u00a0file\u00a02.The indices of alpha- and beta- diversity were calculated using the QIIME package (v1.9, http://qiime.org/). Comparison of these indices between groups was conducted using Student\u2019s t-test. The Non-Metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling (NMDS) analysis was performed using the vegan package in R software v3.3.Paired comparisons of the read counts between tumour and benign specimens were conducted using Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. The p-values were corrected for false discovery using the Benjamini & Hochberg (BH) method. Only the genera with BH-adjusted p-value <\u20090.05 and fold-change >\u20092 were considered as significantly different between specimen groups.Nonparametric Spearman correlation was calculated between the bacterial genes, genera and the host genes as well as the clinical parameters, including Gleason Score and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, in terms of their values among the 130 specimens. The returned p-values were corrected for false discovery using BH method. A Spearman correlation coefficient\u2009>\u20090.7 as well as a BH-adjusted p-value <\u20090.05 was taken as the threshold for a significantly strong relationship.The sequences of the bacterial genes were obtained by de novo assembly using Trinity software (v2.4, https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/trinityrnaseq/wiki). Annotation of these transcripts was performed by BLAST search of the assembled nucleotide sequences against NCBI non-redundant protein library. The read counts of these bacterial genes were normalized with the same method as the metatranscriptome analysis.The Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF) cohort [16] and the JHMI cohort [17] were used for the KM analysis. The patients in the cohorts were split into two subgroups by the mean expression value of the three small RNA genes, respectively, and then the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed using R package \u201csurvival\u201d (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/index.html). Weighted Cox regression models (survival 2.38\u20133) were used to generate KM curve p-values.The cohort in this study is comprised of 65 matched PCa tumours and adjacent benign tissue from Chinese patients who underwent radical prostatectomy. Whole genome sequencing yielded 176\u2013330 Gb between specimens, and whole transcriptome sequencing ranged from 5 to 22 Gb. After filtering human RNA and mapping against microbial genomes, the abundance of bacterial reads derived from metagenome varied from 69 to 101,542 reads per 109 human reads; accordingly, the multiplicity of infection (MOI) varied from 6.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2212\u20095 to 0.1 bacterial cells per human cell when assuming an average size of bacterial genomes to be 3\u2009Mb. Similarly, most reads derived from metatranscriptome were also of human origin (>\u200997%), with the bacterial abundance ranging from 3.9\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 to 3.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 reads per 104 host GAPDH reads.Four viruses were identified in the metagenome and metatranscriptome, all of which belong to dsDNA viruses. However, for majority of specimens, the viral read counts were close to zero and therefore uninformative (Additional\u00a0file\u00a04).Neither the total bacterial load nor any specific genus showed significant differential distribution between the tumour and benign specimens at the metagenomic level (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p\u2009>\u20090.05). The situation at the metatranscriptomic level was the same.We further divided the patients into lower and higher grade groups based on Gleason Score: the low-grade group included 6 and 3\u2009+\u20094; the higher-grade group included 8, 9, 10 and 4\u2009+\u20093. The alpha-diversity did not differ significantly between these two groups (paired t test, p\u2009>\u20090.05; Fig. 2g, i), and the NMDS analysis could not separate them (Fig. 2h, j).This is the first study employing an integrated metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approach to investigate human prostate microbiome. Escherichia, Propionibacterium, Acinetobacter, and Pseudomonas were found to be abundant in both the metagenome and metatranscriptome and thus constitute the core of the prostate microbiome in this Chinese population. Escherichia and Propionibacterium have previously been shown to stimulate progression of PCa in in vitro experiments [6, 8, 9], but the biological significance for the other bacteria identified in this study remains unclear. As expected, many of the organisms identified in the prostate tissue have also been detected in urine, semen, and expressed prostatic secretions [18\u201321]. This similar microbial composition provides evidence for the theory of ascending transmitted infection in the male urogenital tract to the seminal vesicles and prostate.Several previous studies have associated a history of sexually transmitted infections with the risk of prostate cancer [22\u201324]. Nevertheless, we did not detect sexually transmitted disease-related organisms in this study, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis or Ureaplasma urealyticum. Further, we did not detect viruses reported to be present in prostate tissues such as JCV, BKV, human papillomavirus (HPV) or human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) [11, 25\u201327]. Thus untreated sexually transmitted infections or viral infections are not expected to account for a significant proportion of PCa risk in the general male population, or at least in the investigated cohort.The most urgent question in this field is whether the microbiomes from the tumour and benign tissues differ from each other and whether this difference has a causal relationship with carcinogenesis. In this study, we did not find any bacterial species that showed significantly differential distribution between tumours and their matched benign specimens at either DNA or RNA level. Also we did not find a significant difference between the tumour specimens of low and high Gleason Scores. These findings suggest that the identified microbiota may comprise the normal flora of the prostate. Due to the close proximity of the regions compared and the field effect, we still cannot entirely exclude a causal role for bacterial infection and local PCa progression. To fully address this question, non-diseased prostate specimens are required to determine whether a healthy prostate is normally sterile or has a specific microbial flora.The availability of the host transcriptome allowed us to detect a correlation between expression of human small RNA genes and Pseudomonas genes. Functional annotation has assigned these small RNAs to pseudouridylation, which is a major form of post-transcriptional RNA modification. Through pseudouridylation these small RNAs participate in the regulation of gene expression and therefore affect pre-mRNA splicing, translation fidelity and possibly mRNA stability and decay [28, 29]. It has been established that pseudouridylation can be induced as a response to external stress, such as heat shock or nutrient deprivation [30]. High expression of these small RNAs in a subset of patients with low rates of metastasis suggests a negative association between Pseudomonas infection and metastasis. If this association is validated in larger cohorts then the expression profile of the bacterial and small RNA genes may be used as biomarker for active surveillance.In this study we employed an integrated metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approach to investigate the prostate microbiome of PCa patients. Bacteria were detected in all specimens but the composition was not significantly different between the matched tumour and adjacent benign tissues or between different tumour grades. We also identified a strongly correlated expression profile between Pseudomonas genes and human small RNAs that may be related to metastasis. The exact mechanism of this host-pathogen interaction awaits future research.Benjamini & HochbergBK polyomavirusBurrows-Wheeler AlignerCleveland Clinic FoundationHuman cytomegalovirusHuman papillomavirusJC polyomavirusKaplan-MeierMetastatic recurrenceMultiplicity of infectionNon-Metric Multi-Dimensional ScalingProstate cancerThe study was funded by China Scholarship Council (CSC201606325044 to YF), Terry Fox Foundation (201012TFF to CC), Prostate Cancer Canada Team Grant (T2013\u201301 to CC), National Natural Science Foundation of China (81472397 to SR).All data supporting the conclusions of this article are included in this article and its additional files.

The most abundant genera identified from both metagenome and metatranscriptome included Escherichia, Propionibacterium, Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas (Fig.\u00a01), although the exact quantitative compositions varied (Fig. 1 and Additional file 3).\n\nFig. 1\nBacterial composition of prostate microbiome revealed by metagenomic (a) and metatranscripotomic sequencing (b). The upper UPGMA tree was constructed based on the weighted_UniFrac distance between specimens. The heatmap below represents the normalized read counts for the top 10 abundant genera. The lines below connect the matched tumour/benign specimens\nAt both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic level, the tumour and benign specimens did not differ from each other in terms of the alpha-diversity of their microbiomes (paired t test, p\u2009>\u20090.05; Fig. 2a, d). The beta-diversity showed that the paired specimens from the same patients had a more similar bacterial composition to each other than between different patients (paired t test, p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig. 2b, e); the NMDS analysis could not separate tumour and benign specimens (Fig. 2c, f).\n\nFig. 2\nComparison of biodiversity indices between different groups of specimens. Panel a-f show comparisons between tumour and benign specimens; panel g-j show comparisons between specimens of high and low Gleason Scores.

Panel a, d, g and i show comparison of alpha-diversity indices; ns (not significant), p\u2009>\u20090.05 by unpaired Student\u2019s t-test. Panel b and e show comparisons of beta-diversity indices. Distances between specimens were divided into four groups: \u2018paired\u2019, distance between the matched tumour/benign specimens from the same patients; \u2018intra-tumour\u2019, distance between tumour specimens from different patients; \u2018intra-benign\u2019, distance between benign specimens from different patients; \u2018Tumour vs Benign\u2019, distance between tumour and benign specimens from different patients. ***, p\u2009<\u20090.001 by unpaired Student\u2019s t-test. Panel c, f, h and j are NMDS plots\nAt either metagenomic or metatranscriptomic level, no significant correlation could be found between the bacterial load (either total or of any specific genus) and any clinical parameters such as Gleason Score and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (Spearman correlation test, r\u2009<\u20090.7). Correlations between microbial and host genes in terms of their expression profile were also investigated. Interestingly, we identified 191 pairs of host-pathogen genes that have a significantly similar expression profile (Spearman correlation test, r\u2009>\u20090.7), nearly half of which involved ten Pseudomonas genes and eight host genes (Fig.\u00a03). All eight host genes encode small RNA and share remarkably similar structures. Moreover, differential expression of SNORA28, RNU2-48P and SNORA40B stratified patients in terms of metastatic recurrence in another two well-studied cohorts [16, 17], suggesting that the infections caused by Pseudomonas spp. and the associated expression of these small RNAs are negatively related with metastasis.\n\nFig. 3\nCorrelation between bacterial metatranscriptome and host gene expression. Panel a shows the Spearman correlation values between ten Pseudomonas genes (listed below) and eight host genes (listed right). The predicted secondary structures for these host genes are displayed. The detailed annotation and nucleotide sequences of these bacterial genes are listed in Additional file 5. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots in panel b categorize the patients into the low and high group based on a median split of expression of the three small RNA genes. The higher the probability on the y-axis, the higher the chance of these patients NOT having metastatic recurrence (MET). The p-value of KM curve was generated by Weighted Cox regression models. The analysis for RNU2-48P and SNORA28 used the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF) cohort [16], and the analysis for SNORA40 used the JHMI cohort [17]\n\n\nAdditional file 1:\nClinical pathological information of study cohort.

In this study, a novel Trichoderma strain was identified, which could promote plant growth and reduce the disease index of gray mold caused by Botrytis cinerea in cucumber. To assess the impact of Trichoderma inoculation on the plant response, a multi-omics approach was performed in the Trichoderma-inoculated cucumber plants through the analyses of the plant transcriptome, proteome, and phytohormone content.A novel Trichoderma strain was identified by morphological and molecular analysis, here named T. longibrachiatum H9. Inoculation of T. longibrachiatum H9 to cucumber roots promoted plant growth in terms of root length, plant height, and fresh weight. Root colonization of T. longibrachiatum H9 in the outer layer of epidermis significantly inhibited the foliar pathogen B. cinerea infection in cucumber. The plant transcriptome and proteome analyses indicated that a large number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in cucumber plants 96\u2009h post T. longibrachiatum H9 inoculation. Up-regulated DEGs and DEPs were mainly associated with defense/stress processes, secondary metabolism, and phytohormone synthesis and signaling, including jasmonic acid (JA), ethylene (ET) and salicylic acid (SA), in the T. longibrachiatum H9-inoculated cucumber plants in comparison to untreated plants. Moreover, the JA and SA contents significantly increased in cucumber plants with T. longibrachiatum H9 inoculation.Application of T. longibrachiatum H9 to the roots of cucumber plants effectively promoted plant growth and significantly reduced the disease index of gray mold caused by B. cinerea. The analyses of the plant transcriptome, proteome and phytohormone content demonstrated that T. longibrachiatum H9 mediated plant systemic resistance to B. cinerea challenge through the activation of signaling pathways associated with the phytohormones JA/ET and SA in cucumber.Botrytis cinerea is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen that infects more than 200 commercial crops, leading to significant agricultural losses worldwide [1]. To date, chemical fungicides remain the primary method of controlling this pathogen. Due to the detrimental effects on the environment and potential risks for human health of chemical fungicides, a biocontrol method would constitute a preferable alternative approach [2]. Trichoderma spp. are plant growth-promoting fungi that have been found to have great potential for the control of gray mold caused by B. cinerea [3, 4]. The biocontrol can be achieved by a direct interaction between Trichoderma and pathogens, or indirectly by inducing plant resistance to pathogens in the same or different parts from the pathogen infection sites. Traditionally, Trichoderma spp. directly antagonize pathogens by mycoparasitism, secretion of antibiotics, and competition for space and nutrients [5\u20137]. However, subsequent discoveries have demonstrated that these biocontrol agents can also interact intimately with plant roots, even colonizing the outer epidermal layers, and act as avirulent, opportunistic plant symbionts [3, 7]. Root colonization by selected Trichoderma isolates has been reported to promote plant growth and increase resistance to a variety of pathogens, both soil-borne and foliar, in various plant species [8\u201312]. Although the mechanism of induced plant resistance is not fully understood, the plant response to Trichoderma spp. has been studied at the physiological and biochemical levels. These studies have shown that colonization by Trichoderma spp. triggers a series of plant responses that may enhance the defensive capacity of the plant. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are activated in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves by inoculation of the roots with T. hamatum T382 [8]. The cucumber MAPK homologous to A. thaliana MPK3 is induced by incubation of the roots with T. asperellum T203 [13]. Activation of MAPK cascades will alter the phosphorylation status of many substrate proteins to regulate diverse downstream signaling pathways, such as phytohormone signaling [14]. Plant hormone signaling may modulate the defense network by translating Trichoderma-induced upstream signaling events into the activation of defense responses.In the past, researchers found that contacting with pathogenic and non-pathogenic organisms would trigger two main defense mechanisms in plants: systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and induced systemic resistance (ISR). SAR is commonly triggered by local pathogen attack, correlating with the involvement of salicylic acid (SA) and the activation of PR genes. ISR is activated when the plant interacts with non-pathogenic rhizosphere fungi or bacteria, and requires jasmonic acid (JA)/ethylene (ET) [10, 15]. However, the traditional knowledge of ISR became controversial in recent years. Increasing research has demonstrated that Trichoderma may induce systemic resistance through multiple hormonal signaling pathways, and the specific hormones involved are dependent on both the plant species and Trichoderma strains involved. The cross-talk among different hormone signaling pathways may render plants capable of finely regulating immune responses [8, 10, 15\u201323]. It has also been demonstrated that Trichoderma spp. can positively interfere with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, e.g., through increasing the ROS scavenging ability of the plant at future infection sites, thereby potentially reducing the damaging levels of ROS in the leaves, thus limiting B. cinerea infection [24\u201327]. The expression of defense-related proteins can be strongly potentiated when plants are challenged by additional pathogens, even at sites distant from the location of Trichoderma colonization [3]. Along with other defense strategies, the production of secondary metabolites, such as phytoalexins, plays important roles in the plant defense against B. cinerea [26, 28\u201332]. Collectively, it is likely that Trichoderma spp. induce multiple levels of changes in plant metabolism that can lead to increased resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses, and thus the mechanism of Trichoderma-induced systemic resistance requires further investigation [33].Cucumber is one of the most economically important vegetables worldwide. It is susceptible to infection by the plant-pathogenic fungus B. cinerea. Finding potential biocontrol Trichoderma spp. against cucumber diseases is thus warranted [34, 35]. In this study, a novel Trichoderma strain was identified, namely T. longibrachiatum H9, which could promote plant growth and reduce the disease index of gray mold caused by B. cinerea in cucumber. Furthermore, the effect of T. longibrachiatum H9 on induction of defense response in cucumber plants was studied through the analyses of the plant transcriptome, proteome and phytohormone content. The large-scale, multi-omics datasets allowed us to monitor changes in cucumber gene and protein expressions and also provided a basis from which to illustrate the biocontrol mechanism of T. longibrachiatum H9 induced systemic resistance against B. cinerea.The Trichoderma H9 strain was grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium at 30\u2009\u00b0C and identified by morphological observation based on the monograph of Gams and Bisset [36]. The spores were harvested by flooding the surface of the cultures with distilled water. One milliliter of spore suspension was aliquoted and inoculated into potato-dextrose (PD) broth in a rotary shaker at 30\u2009\u00b0C and 200\u2009rpm for 48\u2009h. The mycelium was collected by filtration and washed three times with distilled water. Genomic DNA was extracted using a commercial DNA extraction kit. Using the Trichoderma strain H9 genome as the template, the ITS and TEF-1\u03b1 genes were amplified using specific primers, which were described in Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Table S1 (ITS4 and ITS6 for ITS, as well as EF1-728F and TEF1-LLErev for TEF-1\u03b1). The PCR products were then sequenced by the Sangon Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China. The ITS and TEF-1\u03b1 sequences of this strain were deposited in GenBank with the accession numbers MF111118 and MK179408 respectively, and were then aligned with the corresponding sequences of known Trichoderma strains using NCBI BLAST. The phylogenetic trees were constructed under Maximum Likelihood method using MEGA 7 software [37] based on the ITS or TEF-1\u03b1 sequences. The phylogeny tests were evaluated through performing 1000 bootstrap replicates.Seeds of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) were purchased from Tianjin Kernel Cucumber Research Institute (Tianjin, China). The seeds were sterilized in 70% ethanol for 2\u2009min, 2.0% NaOCl for 2\u2009min, washed with sterile water three times, and then placed on a sterile gauze sheet with liquid 1/2 Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium in a Petri dish at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 24\u2009h. Germinated seeds (30 per box) were placed on a sterile gauze sheet on top of a sterile steel screen in a 50\u2009\u00d7\u200925\u2009\u00d7\u20098 (depth) cm pot system under a 12\u2009h light/12\u2009h dark cycle at 25\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u2009\u00b0C with a light intensity of 120\u2009\u03bcmol/m2s. The steel screen holds the seeds 1\u2009cm above the liquid medium [38].Trichoderma inoculation was performed when the plants had grown to the 3-leaf stage, at which point the spore suspension of Trichoderma H9 at a final concentration 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cfu/mL was added to the pot. 1/2 MS medium was used instead of spore suspension in the control group.The B. cinerea challenge was performed 24\u2009h post H9 inoculation (24 hpTi). Ten microliters of B. cinerea spore suspension at a concentration of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009108\u2009cfu/mL was injected into the abaxial surface of the cucumber leaves. Water was injected as the control for the B. cinerea challenge. In total, four different treatment groups were established, namely non-inoculated, non-challenged plants (\u2212T-B), non-inoculated, challenged plants (\u2212T\u2009+\u2009B), inoculated, non-challenged plants (+T-B), and inoculated, challenged plants (+T\u2009+\u2009B) [10].The method for Trichoderma plant inoculation was described above. Thirty plants were used for each treatment. Treated plants were placed under a 12\u2009h light/12\u2009h dark cycle at 25\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u2009\u00b0C. After two weeks, the plants were harvested and the root length, plant height and fresh weight were measured. Three replicates were performed.Cucumber root samples (4 to 10\u2009mm) were collected from the main root at the Trichoderma penetration sites, 96 hpTi. Samples were treated and then examined in a Hitachi H-7650 transmission electron microscope as described [31, 38]. The sites of root colonization by Trichoderma were characterized by comparing the samples from Trichoderma-inoculated and non-inoculated groups. Five samples from five different roots for each group, and 10 ultrathin sections for each sample were observed.Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software, version 20.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, US). The data from plant growth promoting assays, biocontrol efficacy and plant hormones measurement assays were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and the statistical significance was determined using pair-wise comparisons (P\u2009<\u20090.05).The second and third cucumber leaves were collected from the -T-B and\u2009+\u2009T-B groups at 96 hpTi respectively when the plants in the +T\u2009+\u2009B group showed a clear inhibition of B. cinerea infection. The samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then sent to Shanghai Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China for RNA sequencing. The reference genome for transcriptome analysis was acquired from ftp://cucurbitgenomics.org/pub/cucurbit/genome/cucumber/Chinese_long/v2/. Three biological replicates in each group were performed and raw data were deposited into the Sequence Read Archive database with the accession number SRP136435. A basic analysis was performed on the transcriptome data, including data pre-processing, genomic mapping, gene expression analysis, analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and Gene Ontology (GO)/Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis of DEGs. Gene expression levels were determined by FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped reads) as described [40]. In order to screen DEGs, up- and down-regulation of genes was defined when the adjusted P-value was <\u20090.05 and the absolute fold change was \u22652.0 (\u2223log2(fold change)\u2223 \u2265\u20091.0). Regarding the GO/KEGG enrichment analysis, P-value <\u20090.05 was chosen as the standard to determine enrichment.The second and third cucumber leaves were collected from the -T-B and\u2009+\u2009T-B groups at 96 hpTi, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, respectively, and then sent to Allwegene Technology Inc. Beijing, China for iTRAQ sequencing. Raw data related to this study have been deposited into iProX (ww.iprox.org) with ID IPX0001185000/PXD009314. Protein identification was performed using the ProteinPilot\u2122 v4.5 search engine against a database (Uniprot Cucumis sativus L). Only peptides with an unused score\u2009\u2265\u20091.3 and confidence interval\u2009>\u200995% were counted to reduce the probability of false peptide identification. Each confident protein was identified with at least one unique peptide. Furthermore, differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were screened by iTRAQ quantification and up- and down-regulation of proteins was defined when the P-value was <\u20090.05 and the absolute fold change was \u22652.0. GO/KEGG enrichment analyses of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) for functional annotations were further performed, and P-value <\u20090.05 was selected as the standard to determine the enrichment.The expression trends of the genes from the transcriptome analysis and their corresponding proteins from the proteome analysis were compared as described [41]. The results were divided into three categories: correlated genes/Proteins, DEGs/DEPs with corresponding proteins/genes, and DEGs/DEPs with corresponding DEPs/DEGs. Correlated DEGs/DEPs were further divided into two categories: with the same expression trend and the opposite expression trend.The same treatment groups were established (\u2212T-B and\u2009+\u2009T-B) as in the previous experiments. The cucumber leaves were harvested from each group at 96 hpTi, and the SA and JA contents were measured using HPLC/MS/MS (high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry), which was performed by Zoonbio Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Nanjing, China. Samples were separated by Agilent1290 Infinity liquid chromatography from Agilent (Santa Clara, CA, US) and analyzed by QTrap 6500 mass spectrometer from AB Sciex (Framingham, MA, US) as described [42]. Three replicates were performed.Leaf tissue was collected from the second and third cucumber leaf in the -T-B and\u2009+\u2009T-B groups at 96 hpTi, respectively. Total RNA was extracted from each sample using RNAiso\u2122 Plus reagents according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The cDNA synthesis and qRT-PCR were performed according to the PrimeScript\u2122 RT reagent kit. Specific primers used in the qRT-PCR were described in Additional file 1: Table S1. Expression values were normalized to the ACT2 gene. The experiments were repeated three times.The Trichoderma H9 strain was obtained from the soil near a cucumber plant and exhibited the typical morphological features of T. longibrachiatum based on the monograph of Gams and Bisset [36]. Molecular identification based on ITS and TEF-1\u03b1 genes revealed that this H9 strain shared the highest homology in the phylogeny and clustered together with T. longibrachiatum strains, whose species identity has been confirmed by phylogenetic analysis [43\u201347]. The H9 strain was thus identified to be T. longibrachiatum, and was accordingly named T. longibrachiatum H9.Based on up-regulated DEGs or DEPs, biological processes was the most enriched category and the GO terms related to phytohormones, secondary metabolism and defense/stress processes were significantly enriched (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The biosynthesis and signaling of hormones, including JA/ET and SA, were observed as plant responses in the plant hormones category. \u201cPhenylpropanoid biosynthetic process\u201d, \u201cflavonoid biosynthetic process\u201d, \u201clignin biosynthetic process\u201d and other secondary metabolic processes were identified in the secondary metabolites category. Many GO terms related to defense/stress processes were observed including \u201cdefense response\u201d, \u201cresponse to oxidative stress\u201d, \u201cresponse to reactive oxygen species\u201d, and so on. Meanwhile, several signal transduction GO terms were observed, such as \u201cMAPK cascade\u201d and \u201csignal transduction by protein phosphorylation\u201d (P\u2009<\u20090.05; Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Table S2, Additional\u00a0file\u00a03: Table S3). Based on down-regulated DEGs or DEPs, \u201cphotosynthesis\u201d and \u201cphotosynthesis, light reaction\u201d were significantly enriched terms (P\u2009<\u20090.05; Additional\u00a0file\u00a04: Table S4, Additional\u00a0file\u00a05: Table S5).In this study, we demonstrated that inoculation of T. longibrachiatum H9 to the cucumber roots triggered an increased resistance to the leaf pathogen B. cinerea, which is characterized by the reduction of the disease incidence. The effect of T. longibrachiatum H9 on induction of defense response was monitored through both the transcriptome and proteome analyses. More specifically, further comparison and analysis of transcriptome and proteome data provided a more reliable basis to illustrate the biocontrol mechanism of T. longibrachiatum H9 induced systemic resistance against B. cinerea. Finally, the following conclusions could be drawn by analyzing our findings and the earlier findings from other researchers.It is known that phytohormones play an important role in the regulation of defense responses in plants. Generally, ISR induced by non-pathogen organisms relies on JA signaling, while pathogen-induced SAR is dependent on SA signaling. In recent years, many reported studies have demonstrated that multiple hormones may be involved in shaping ISR [8, 10, 15\u201323]. Thus, the current view on the specific hormones involved in ISR remains controversial, and the mechanism of ISR seems more complicated. Mathys et al. (2012) found that the SA pathway was a first player in the T. hamatum T382-triggered ISR-prime in A. thaliana, and SA was synthesized from chorismate rather than phenylalanine. The JA-pathway was not activated at 48\u2009hp. Ti in the T. hamatum T382-preinoculated plants without a subsequent infection, and B. cinerea challenge caused a clear activation of the JA pathway for ISR-boost [8]. Meanwhile they defined ISR-prime phase as the process of the initial Trichoderma-plant interaction and ISR-boost phase as the effects by Trichoderma on plant responses after subsequent challenge.However, Shoresh et al. (2010) mentioned that the presence of non-pathogenic Trichoderma may prime the systemic resistance system, which means that the entire pathway may not be turned on constantly, and the plant will react more rapidly or more strongly in a subsequent pathogen infection. Specifically, the priming is not an universal phenomenon in all the Trichoderma-plant interactions, for example, T. harzianum T22 inoculation caused a constitutive turning on of some PR proteins in maize plants even without any pathogen [15, 48]. Applying specific inhibitors and analyzing the expression of key genes in the JA/ET signaling demonstrated that JA/ET were involved in the protective effect triggered by T. asperellum T203 against P. syringae pv. Lachrymans. Remarkably, the Lox1, involved in JA production, was hardly expressed in leaves and only clearly induced in roots with T. asperellum T203 inoculation before pathogen infection. In contrast, no difference of SA content in both roots and leaves were observed in the T. asperellum T203 pre-inoculated cucumber plants, regardless of whether the plants was infected with P. syringae pv. Lachrymans or not [10]. Our results showed that both JA/ET and SA production and/or signaling activation were observed as important plant responses in the Trichoderma-inoculated cucumber plants. Specifically, some points in our results differed from earlier findings: (i) the key components of the JA/ET and SA pathways were clearly detected in cucumber leaves and significantly up-regulated 96\u2009h post T. longibrachiatum H9 inoculation without the subsequent infections, such as LOX (lipoxygenase), AOS (allene oxide synthase) and ACX (acyl-CoA oxidase) associated with JA synthesis, and metK (S-adenosylmethionine synthetase), ACS (aminocyclopropane carboxylate synthase) and ACO (aminocyclopropane carboxylate oxidase) associated with ET synthesis, as well as PAD4 (phytoalexin deficient 4) and PAL (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase) associated with SA synthesis. (ii) The expression of PALs rather than SID2/ICS2 was up-regulated at both gene and protein levels, indicating that SA was synthesized via the phenylalanine pathway rather than from chorismate pathway for T. longibrachiatum H9-induced ISR. The discrepancy among different researches suggested that the specific hormones involved may vary and behave differently in different plant-Trichoderma interactions, under different conditions and at different time points. However, the two points remain unknown in our study and require further investigation: (i) whether the additional pathogen B. cinerea challenge induces a higher plant response in the T. longibrachiatum H9-inoculated plants (whether the priming occurs or not), (ii) whether B. cinerea induces the plant response by itself or in the Trichoderma-mediated manner.The production of secondary metabolites, especially phytoalexins, is an important plant defense strategy against pathogens. Phenylpropanoid compounds are precursors to a wide range of antimicrobial phenolics, including lignins, flavonoids, isoflavonoids and cumarins. These compounds are induced in response to microbial attack and can inhibit the growth of attacking pathogens [3, 49]. The phenylpropanoid pathway is the major source of the production of antimicrobial phenolic compounds. Several genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway have been found to be up-regulated in A. thaliana after inoculation with T. asperelloides T203, including PAL1, PAL2 and 4CL [26]. Camalexin, as an important secondary metabolite, accumulated in A. thaliana seedlings colonized with Trichoderma virens [29]. The biosynthesis of anthocyanins was increased in A. thaliana roots after inoculation of T. hamatum T382 [8]. In our results, the biosynthesis and metabolism processes of phenylpropanoid, flavonoid, lignin, coumarine, anthocyanin and some other secondary metabolites were activated, which implied that secondary metabolites play important roles for induced plant resistance in the T. longibrachiatum H9-inoculated cucumber plants.Additionally, the antimicrobial activity of lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) in plant defense has also been reported against pathogens in numerous studies, probably due to their ability to interact with biological membranes, which may cause membrane permeabilization [50]. Proteome analysis and various transcriptome studies have also revealed altered expression of LTPs in plants inoculated with Trichoderma strains. In our study, lipid oxidation and lipid catabolic processes were also up-regulated in the T. longibrachiatum H9-inoculated cucumber plants, which indicated the possible importance of LTPs in the defense against B. cinerea in cucumber.MAMP (microbe-associated molecular pattern)-triggered immunity (MTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI) have been reported as two models of innate immunity in plants. Trichoderma can produce MAMPs as elicitors to activate plant defense responses. Plants deploy pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to recognize the elicitors and activate a primary defense response [7, 41, 51\u201354]. Two MAMP/PRR pairs have been well characterized in Trichoderma spp. and plants. The first is ethylene-inducing-xylanase (Xyn2 or Eix) as the elicitor and its corresponding receptor EIX2 [55]. The second is chitin as the elicitor and its corresponding receptor CERK1 (chitin elicitor receptor-like kinase 1) [56]. Successful pathogens will deploy effectors to interfere with MTI and induce ETI which is based on the highly specific interaction of the pathogen effectors and their corresponding NB-LRR class receptors encoded by plant resistance (R) genes. Several transcriptomic and proteomic studies have reported that plant interactions with various Trichoderma spp. resulted in the up-regulation of cytoplasmic NBS/leucine rich repeat receptors (NBS/LRRs) [57, 58], suggesting that Trichoderma spp. can also induce ETI to activate plant defense.Root colonization of T. longibrachiatum H9 in the outer layer of epidermis effectively promoted plant growth and reduced the disease index of gray mold caused by B. cinerea in cucumber. Furthermore, the large-scale, multi-omics datasets indicated that T. longibrachiatum H9 inoculation modulated the defense network and resulted in an enhanced defensive capacity in cucumber plants, probably through the activation of signaling pathways associated with the phytohormones JA/ET and SA.Not applicable.This work was financially supported by the Key Fundamental Research Program of Hebei Province (15962904D), the National Water Pollution Control and Treatment Science and Technology Major Project of China (2015ZX07204\u2013007), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (31401212).

Three different sites per leaf were selected on the second and third leaves of each plant. Twelve plants for each group were treated. Three replicates were performed. Following treatment, the cucumber plants were grown under a 12\u2009h light/12\u2009h dark cycle at 25\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u2009\u00b0C. The disease severity of the gray mold was recorded daily. When B. cinerea broadly infected the cucumber leaves in the -T\u2009+\u2009B group, the disease index and inhibition rate were calculated according to the standard for gray mold disease progression. The disease progression of the infected plants was divided into five grades, where grade 0\u2009=\u2009no visible gray mold spot, grade 1\u2009=\u20091\u20135%, grade 3\u2009=\u20096\u201315%, grade 5\u2009=\u200916\u201325%, grade 7\u2009=\u200926\u201350%, and grade 9\u2009=\u2009\u226551% of the leaf surface covered with gray mold. The gray mold development on each plant was recorded using the above 1\u20135 scale, and the disease index was calculated using the following formula [39]:Furthermore, growth-promoting effects by T. longibrachiatum H9 inoculation were observed based on root length, plant height, and fresh weight measurements of the cucumber plants. The average root length, plant height, and fresh weight of the T. longibrachiatum H9-inoculated plants were 7.46\u2009\u00b1\u20090.35\u2009cm, 3.79\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07\u2009cm, and 48.63\u2009\u00b1\u20091.88\u2009g, which were significantly higher than those of untreated plants with 5.02\u2009\u00b1\u20090.16\u2009cm, 3.42\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11\u2009cm, and 38.16\u2009\u00b1\u20091.53\u2009g, respectively (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The T. longibrachiatum H9 strain significantly impacted root length (48.68%), plant height (10.82%), and fresh weight (27.44%) in cucumber (Table\u00a01).Table 1\nInoculation of T. longibrachiatum H9 to cucumber roots effectively promoted cucumber plant growth\n\nNote: * and ** indicate significance at P\u2009<\u20090.05 and 0.01\nIn order to determine if T. longibrachiatum H9 could reduce the symptoms of B. cinerea infection in cucumber, 3-leaf stage cucumber plant roots were treated with T. longibrachiatum H9 and their susceptibility to B. cinerea (+T\u2009+\u2009B) leaf infection was subsequently assessed by comparison to mock-treated plants (\u2212T\u2009+\u2009B). Treatment of cucumber with T. longibrachiatum H9 significantly reduced the disease index after 4, 8, and 12 d, and the inhibition rates increased to 56.7% on the 12th day from 49.62% on the 4th day (P\u2009<\u20090.05; Table\u00a02).Table 2\nTreatment of cucumber with T. longibrachiatum H9 significantly reduced the disease index of gray mold\n\nNote: * and ** indicate significance at P\u2009<\u20090.05 and 0.01\nConsistently, T. longibrachiatum H9 penetrated cucumber root cortical cells and was restricted in the out layer of epidermis after 96\u2009h (96 hpTi), which allowed sufficient time for spore germination, colonization of the roots and induction of a plant response. A large number of Trichoderma hyphae developed at the root surface (RS) (Fig.\u00a01a), penetrated into the root epidermis (EP) (Fig. 1b) and progressed towards the cortex (CO) (Fig. 1c), mainly by intercellular growth. The mycelia of T. longibrachiatum H9 grew mainly between the cells and thickened the cell wall without entering the cell, as observed by transmission electron microscopy. Taken together, the biocontrol assays indicated that root colonization by T. longibrachiatum H9 may induce systemic disease resistance against the foliar pathogen B. cinerea in cucumber.\n\nFig. 1\nTransmission electron micrographs indicated that T. longibrachiatum H9 had colonized the cucumber roots. Trichoderma hyphae developed at the root surface (a), penetrated into the root epidermis (b), and progressed towards the cortex (c). Arrows indicate Trichoderma hyphae. Bars: A, 10\u2009\u03bcm; B, 500\u2009\u03bcm; C, 500\u2009\u03bcm\nTo examine the underlying mechanisms of the plant response associated with T. longibrachiatum H9-induced plant resistance, both RNA-Seq and proteome analysis were performed on cucumber plant samples harvested at 96 hpTi from the -T-B and\u2009+\u2009T-B groups, respectively. Compared to untreated plants (+T-B vs. -T-B), 3765 DEGs were identified from the RNA-Seq analysis, with 2304 up-regulated genes and 1461 down-regulated genes under T. longibrachiatum H9 inoculation. A total of 922 DEPs were identified from the proteome analysis with 428 up-regulated and 494 down-regulated proteins (P\u2009<\u20090.05 and fold change >\u20092.0; Table\u00a03). GO enrichment and KEGG enrichment analyses were further performed to classify the up-regulated and down-regulated DEGs and DEPs.Table 3\nSummary of the number of DEGs and DEPs detected in the T. longibrachiatum H9-inoculated cucumber plants, compared to untreated plants (+T-B vs. -T-B)\nThe KEGG enrichment analysis allowed us to identify specific pathways according to DEGs or DEPs, respectively. The pathways related to the biosynthesis of phytohormones, including \u201cphenylalanine metabolism (SA biosynthesis)\u201d, \u201calpha-linolenic acid metabolism (JA biosynthesis)\u201d, and \u201ccysteine and methionine metabolism (ET biosynthesis)\u201d, were significantly enriched based on up-regulated DEGs or DEPs, respectively. Moreover, the pathways \u201cphenylpropanoid biosynthesis\u201d, \u201cflavonoid biosynthesis\u201d, \u201cMAPK signaling pathway\u201d and \u201cperoxisome pathway\u201d, which are associated with secondary metabolite biosynthesis, signal transduction, or defense/stress processes, were also activated in the T. longibrachiatum H9-inoculated cucumber plants (P\u2009<\u20090.05; Additional\u00a0file\u00a06: Table S6, Additional\u00a0file\u00a07: Table S7). The top 20 enriched KEGG pathways based on up-regulated DEGs or DEPs were shown, respectively (Figs.\u00a02 and 3). The presence of T. longibrachiatum H9 reprogrammed the gene and protein expression related to phytohormones, secondary metabolism, and defense/stress processes in cucumber plants. This suggested that T. longibrachiatum H9 inoculation might enhance plant defense capacity through activating the signaling pathways associated with the phytohormones JA/ET and SA.\n\nFig. 2\nThe top 20 enriched KEGG pathways based on up-regulated DEGs in the T. longibrachiatum H9-inoculated plants in comparison to untreated plants (+T-B vs.-T-B)\n\n\nFig. 3\nThe top 20 enriched KEGG pathways based on up-regulated DEPs in the T. longibrachiatum H9-inoculated plants in comparison to untreated plants (+T-B vs.-T-B)\nTo further explore the findings from both transcriptome and proteome data, the correlation analysis was performed by comparing the expression trends of the genes from the transcriptome analysis and their corresponding proteins from the proteome analysis. 3938 genes/proteins were correlated in the totally detected 4171 proteins and 20,189 genes. Among the 3765 DEGs/922 DEPs, 798 DEGs/835 DEPs showed corresponding proteins/genes, and 277 DEGs/DEPs showed corresponding DEPs/DEGs. Furthermore, 241 DEGs/DEPs showed the same expression trends with 132 DEGs/DEPs up-regulated and 109 DEGs/DEPs down-regulated (Table\u00a04, Additional\u00a0file\u00a08: Table S8). The enriched KEGG pathways based on the 132 up-regulated DEGs/DEPs were analyzed and the top 20 pathways were shown (Fig.\u00a04). \u201cPhenylalanine metabolism (SA biosynthesis)\u201d, \u201calpha-linolenic acid metabolism (JA biosynthesis)\u201d, \u201ccysteine and methionine metabolism (ET biosynthesis)\u201d, \u201cbiosynthesis of secondary metabolites\u201d, \u201cphenylpropanoid biosynthesis\u201d, and \u201cperoxisome\u201d pathways were remain significantly enriched. In contrast, \u201cribosome\u201d, \u201cporphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism\u201dand \u201cphotosynthesis\u201d were the most significantly enriched pathways based on the 109 down-regulated DEGs/DEPs (Additional\u00a0file\u00a09: Figure S1).Table 4\nCorrelation of DEGs and DEPs detected in the T. longibrachiatum H9-inoculated cucumber plants, compared to untreated plants (+T-B vs. -T-B)\n\n\nFig. 4\nThe top 20 enriched KEGG pathways based on up-regulated corresponding DEGs/DEPs in the T. longibrachiatum H9-inoculated plants in comparison to untreated plants (+T-B vs.-T-B)\nTo evaluate the transcriptome results, several genes in the hormone pathways were selected for qRT-PCR analysis in the -T-B and\u2009+\u2009T-B groups at 96\u2009hp. Ti, such as LOX1, LOX2, and AOS1 associated with JA, PAD4 associated with SA, as well as ACO associated with ET. The expression of these genes was significantly up-regulated in the +T-B group, compared to that in the -T-B group (Fig.\u00a05).\n\nFig. 5\nThe expression of hormone-related genes was up-regulated in cucumber plants inoculated with T. longibrachiatum H9. Among these expressed genes, LOX1, LOX2, and AOS1 were associated with JA; PAD4 was associated with SA; and ACO was associated with ET (* and ** indicate significance at P\u2009<\u20090.05 and 0.01)\nBased on the transcriptome and proteome results, the key enzymes in JA and SA biosynthesis were up-regulated at both the RNA and protein levels. Therefore, the JA and SA contents in cucumber leaves were analyzed in the -T-B and\u2009+\u2009T-B groups at 96 hpTi. The SA content increased to 137.29\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8120\u2009ng/g, and the JA content rose to 151.45\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0403\u2009ng/g in the +T-B group (Table\u00a05). The JA and SA contents significantly increased in the T. longibrachiatum H9-inoculated cucumber plants, compared to that in the untreated plants. These results implied that JA and SA played important roles in regulating the plant response and enhancing plant defense in cucumber plants with T. longibrachiatum H9 inoculation.Table 5\nThe JA and SA contents in cucumber leaves significantly increased after inoculation of T. longibrachiatum H9 on the roots\n\nNote: * and ** indicate significance at P\u2009<\u20090.05 and 0.01\nIn our results, LRRs, CDPKs, calcium-transporting ATPases and some other elicitor-responsive proteins were up-regulated, which indicated that MTI and ETI immunity systems may exist in the T. longibrachiatum H9-inoculated cucumber plants. Moreover, a wide array of plant responses including the activation of MAPK signaling cascades, phytohormone responses, defense/stress-related responses and the production of secondary metabolites, was discovered at the transcription and protein levels. Based on the results, we developed a hypothetical working model in which T. longibrachiatum H9 inoculation enhanced plant resistance in cucumber to effectively antagonize B. cinerea. Inoculation of T. longibrachiatum H9 to cucumber roots resulted in the induction of LRRs and CDPKs and other elicitor-responsive proteins, which are known as specific determinants of the plant immune response to deliver the signal of perception. Subsequently, MAPKs and WRKYs were activated as an early plant response. The induction of the MAPK signaling cascade is known to regulate diverse downstream signaling pathways and convert extracellular signals into intracellular responses [15]. Furthermore, the synthesis and signaling of phytohormones (JA/ET and SA) were activated to translate Trichoderma-induced signaling into the activation of effective defense responses. Consequently, a whole array of defense/stress-related genes and proteins, e.g., several types of detoxifying enzymes for ROS scavenging were up-regulated in the cucumber leaves post T. longibrachiatum H9 inoculation of the roots, thus rendering the cucumber plants more resistant to subsequent B. cinerea attack. Along with other defense strategies, the production of secondary metabolites was also employed as an important plant defense strategy. Finally, these responses would provide cucumber plants with induced resistance to effectively decrease gray mold caused by B. cinerea (Fig.\u00a06).\n\nFig. 6\nA hypothetical working process in cucumber plants with T. longibrachiatum H9 inoculation. LRRs as well as CDPKs and other elicitor-responsive proteins were induced in the Trichoderma H9-inoculated cucumber plants to deliver the signal of perception. Subsequently, MAPK cascades were activated to regulate diverse downstream signaling pathways. Furthermore, phytohormone synthesis and signaling (JA/ET and SA) were activated to translate Trichoderma-induced signaling into the activation of effective defense responses. Consequently, a whole array of defense/stress-related genes and proteins, e.g. a variety of detoxifying enzymes for ROS scavenging, were up-regulated, thus rendering the cucumber plants more resistant to subsequent B. cinerea infection. Along with other defense strategies, the production of secondary metabolites was also employed as an important plant defense strategy\n\n\nAdditional file 1:\nTable S1.
